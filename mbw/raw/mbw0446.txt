[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.200]   Is Apple Pay really dangerous?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000]   Why the Apple watches price just right?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   And a whole lot more coming up next.

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest Apple News.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.680]   And man we had, we're still recovering from a marathon last week.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   This will not be a three hour edition I promise you.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.440]   But we do have many of the culprits from last week back again from the Chicago Sun
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.600]   Times District.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   And Ian Naco is here.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.440]   Does this make us recivitous?
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   Yes.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.400]   Yes we can't stop.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   Just another indication that the podcasting prison system does not work.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.760]   I've become hardened in that three hours I spent in that podcast.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.160]   Podcast is the new black my friends.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   So here from Montreal, Canada, Renee Ritchie is here.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.080]   I'm ashamed to admit Leo I just kept talking.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   I didn't know the show ended.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.920]   I probably would still come for a whole week.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.360]   That's what Muir Cat's for.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.920]   You want to just keep talking.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   And lo and behold you know we should call this show Mark Break Weekly because it's Mark
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   Gurman from 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.680]   Every week he's got the scoops he's here in studio.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.320]   Well sort of via Skype.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   Mark great to have you back.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.760]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Really appreciate it.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   Yeah Mark Break Weekly was your idea.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   I'll give you credit for that.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.680]   And by the way kudos because you nailed it in every respect.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.080]   You nailed it with the MacBook.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.480]   You got that story months ago.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.720]   Yeah that was first week of January during CES.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   It was a pretty big one.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.840]   And I didn't even believe you.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720]   I didn't believe it either.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   One connector.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   What are you crazy?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.200]   12 inch retina.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.880]   Okay maybe but what?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   Those are the best stories.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.560]   The ones that nobody believes and then when they come true everyone's just like whoa.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.800]   Yeah because they remember it.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.440]   They're going to go oh that Gurman he's got good sources.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.600]   Well here's the thing though like if you get something right no one cares but when you
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.560]   get something wrong everyone comes after you.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.400]   You know a friend of mine named John Zee Devorek who's spectacularly wrong much of the time
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.560]   has learned and told me the opposite.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.000]   He says no no you just got to be bold and let the chips fall with me.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.040]   Maybe he's trying to sabotage me.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   I don't know.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.520]   I still can't believe that Mark managed to force Apple to make one connector just to
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   fit the narrative.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.280]   It's ridiculous.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   Clever.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   Good one.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   Very clever.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.120]   Actually we could talk a little bit about the Type C connector because I just got a Chromebook
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.160]   Pixel the new Pixel uses.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.880]   I think Apple could have done this.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.280]   Dual Type C one on each side which would have solved some of the negative comments because
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.720]   then you could power and video or power and charge or power and hard drive.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   But just the one maybe that sells more 79 dollar dongles.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I do like it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.800]   I have since having now have some experience with Type C. You'll like it Andy because
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   it's not going to fall out.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   I actually pulled.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.440]   I had foolishly to hold it in place wrapped the Type C connector around a pair of hands
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.280]   holding a giant Malachite ball that weighs about 20 pounds and I forgot that I had done
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.880]   that grabbed the Pixel and the Type C connector is strong.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.760]   Stayed in the whole thing when flying them out.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.680]   Twenty pound Malachite ball.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   Are you a Gryffindor or something?
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   I can't.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.120]   I use that for incantations.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.160]   Is that how you try to get inside information on what's happening?
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.440]   You can see how it works.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.360]   Whatever you're doing Mark I want that.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.760]   But no it's firm in there.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.080]   It's hard to get it out a little bit.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.920]   Yeah I mean it's a secure connector.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.720]   I got my first USB C device about a month and a half ago and yeah it's a pretty snug
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.920]   as someone who's been complaining about how weak the MagSafe 2 connector is.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.440]   This is like wishing on a monkey's paw you got what you're asked for but not what you
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.080]   actually wanted.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.760]   And given how many times I've pulled a notebook off of a sofa I'm glad that it's not going
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.640]   to be happening to a really heavy machine that has a lot of heft behind it.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.600]   But we'll see how well that works.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.400]   I am just glad to see that Apple is now using some sort of industry standard connector.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.560]   I know that they had a large hand in creating it but it's always every time I pack for a
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.880]   trip even if it's just for one day there's always the power stuff I need for the Apple
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.760]   stuff and then the cable side the one cable I need for absolutely everything else so it's
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.680]   nice to have a relief from that.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   Who did invent Type C Mark?
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.600]   Do you have any idea because Google is also taking credit?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   Right so John Gruber said that Apple had a large hand in it and something about them
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.440]   coming up with it but based on documentation available on the USB Foundation's website
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.960]   it seems like a lot of different companies had a hand in it.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.160]   But it is interesting that Apple was first to announce actual shipping hardware with
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.760]   it and Google came out just the very next day.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.320]   And Apple does have a patent on something that looks a lot like a Type C connector.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:14.680]   Pat and Lay Apple has basically a reversible cable which seems to be very similar.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.600]   This is a video from Stefan Zvarkeling but you can kind of see the Pat and Lay Apple
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   post.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.400]   I have to see if I can find the original post.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.880]   I heard the same thing that Gruber heard.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.760]   I mean it definitely was a team effort but you know sometimes there are people who lead
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.360]   a team or have ideas or contribute to a team or just get the team going in the direction
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   that they want.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.240]   Well, this isn't very much the direction that they want.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.480]   In an industry standard you wouldn't expect one team.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:45.520]   I mean Apple worked with Intel on Firewire, Underbully, you know, 1348.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.560]   I don't know Thunderbolts is standard, right?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.240]   But the patent that you showed I think that's actually lightning.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.400]   No, it's a lightning okay.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.880]   USB, Sean, and the Apple.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.200]   A lot of times some of those patent websites they mix up things that have happened years
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   ago.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.040]   But as you know, you can't credit a patent.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   Everybody patents everything.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.320]   And that was the same team involved with USB C as far as I know.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.720]   So this is the PDF from the USB 3 promoter group.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.480]   Good Lord.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.840]   Could you have a more 1986 logo too?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.520]   That doesn't inspire you to confidence.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.400]   Super speed plus.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.800]   This is the type C on the MacBook, a 3.0.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.400]   It's a 3.1 connector, isn't it?
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.360]   It's the latest.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.840]   And to your point earlier, there's some discussion about whether this precise Broadwell chipset
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.320]   that Apple is using supports the dual side ports or the architecture of the MacBook would
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.400]   allow them to have a controller on both sides.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.520]   This was going for ultra-thin, ultra-light, not for expandability.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.840]   Nor does it have two channels.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.320]   Some USB 3.1 has two channels, but this is I think one 10, I mean, 10 gigabits is plenty,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   but it's one 10 gigabits channel.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   I think.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.800]   Well, you choose your compromises in your design.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.560]   So some have raised the issue of USB is a somewhat dangerous interface.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.400]   We've seen bad USB, it's called, which is malware that infects USB firmware and can
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.880]   be used to then infect the computer it's put into.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920]   This is typically with thumb drives because weirdly enough, virtually all thumb drives,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.960]   even the most secure, have electronically erasable prompts, EEPROMs that you could put new firmware
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.360]   in, bad USB takes advantage of it by hacking the firmware of the USB and then infecting
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.720]   everything you plug it into.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:43.200]   Now, I understand that the Apple power adapter does not have any firmware in it.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   You can't be reprogrammed, so it doesn't have that capability.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.240]   The issue is though, not Apple's adapter or even Google's adapter, but maybe going
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.880]   to a coffee shop, hackers corner and plugging into their USB to charge might have an adverse
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   effect.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   It's the cost of being a standard.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.120]   You want to have standard compatibility.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.840]   It's not unique to USB C. It's not unique to Apple.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.600]   The Chromebook Pixel is the same thing.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   Absolutely.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   Anything.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   Absolutely.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   And it would be difficult to secure it.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.280]   I mean, there are ways to hardware secure, but then you break compatibility, especially
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.040]   with older devices.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.400]   And it's something that maybe Apple could do a prompt on OS 10 the way they do in iOS
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.880]   where it says, "Do you want to trust whatever you're plugging into this device?"
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   But Apple's pretty good at interfacing with the Intel circuitry.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.120]   So hopefully something will come of it, but it's the cost of using USB for business now.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.880]   Well, but there's also a difference there because if you are really, really concerned
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   about security and we're not just talking about, I don't want to surf a porn site and
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.400]   get malware I'm talking about.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.720]   I'm entering another country where I feel as though my laptop is going to be a target
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.640]   of something.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.880]   If you have more than, if you, if you have a different kind of port, then you have the
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.520]   option of simply not plugging.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.080]   If you have, I'm sorry, if you have a separate port that's just for power, you have the option
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.520]   of never connecting a data, a data device to that, to that machine ever.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.160]   However, given that there's only one port and it is the only way to get power into the
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.840]   thing, it would be possible for someone with an unusual interest in your machine to compromise
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.560]   your power adapter.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.160]   And because what are you going to do?
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   Like keep buying, travel with like 10 fully charged up MacBook MacBooks and then just
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.160]   throw them out every time the battery dies.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.360]   No, you're going to have to plug something in there at some time.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.600]   And that's an opportunity for someone to get access.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.520]   Now, obviously we're not talking about a threat that anybody really is going to be, is going
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.760]   to be facing, but it's not a threat that nobody will face.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.000]   And you like to have at least one option there.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   It's like iOS where you have just a lightning port and juice jacking was common for a time.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.400]   And that's why they created the trusted device request here to begin with.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.640]   So imagine it's probably best to think of the MacBook as like an iOS, almost an iOS device
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.080]   based on how it's set up and how the ports work.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:59.040]   And so I think an iOS solution would be the best thing there.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.720]   So other questions people are asking and I don't know the answers.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   I'm sure you guys do.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.000]   Is it like say micro USB, which we now know, which would you use with your smartphones?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.680]   And by the way, Apple, I think is implied that they're, they might use this for the iPhone
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   in the next generation.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.600]   And I imagine other phone manufacturers might.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.320]   Is it like that where you can use any charger?
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.820]   It is.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.960]   So if there's over voltage, it'll correct.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.800]   If it's under voltage, it'll just charge slowly or not at all.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.120]   It's supposed to be.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.760]   Yes, Randy.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.000]   It is just bog standard.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.080]   If you have power, it's supposed to be power across the entire thing.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.440]   It's we'll have the exact pretty much the exact same things that you would assume about
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.960]   USB two or USB three connectors that yes, I suppose it would be possible for someone
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.720]   to put 17 volts across that if they wanted to, but that would not be using the USB standard.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.600]   It's a carrier for an existing standard and that existing standard says here's the amount
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.280]   of current and here's the amount of draw you can put across that port.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.920]   So you should not not only should really anything that power should work.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.440]   And so long as there's not something funny going on inside that that MacBook that tries
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.160]   to figure out what the user is trying to connect to it and reject anything that it doesn't
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.320]   specifically like.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.800]   I had assumed from my conversations with people last week that the new MacBook would
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040]   not discriminate against sources of power.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.360]   So if you happen to have like a 12,000, one of those big honkin, you know, a Toblerone
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   size batteries that can jumpstart a car, if you wanted to use that to get an extra two
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.040]   or three hours of battery off of your air, it would allow you to do that.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.880]   But I assume that was to be the case and now we're seeing reports from people who say
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.800]   that they have talked to the right people and said that no, it's not going to discriminate
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   power sources.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.760]   So anything that gives people more flexibility like that is a really good deal for me.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   We should be, I mean, obviously this is not actually the first device using Type C.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.960]   There's a Nokia tablet that uses Type C. MSI has announced motherboard that will have Type
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.120]   C connectors on it.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:01.840]   I would love this just to replace micro USB and on the one hand for data and power adapters
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.440]   for laptops with, they were all standard.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   Kudos to Apple because this is the first time I can remember Apple's ever done a non, an
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   industry standard power.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.640]   Well, since the iMac, right?
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.160]   I mean, they went with the US for power adapter.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.320]   Yeah, but that was the whole plan.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   They want this to be standard.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.560]   Everyone wants it to be standard and then everything should just work with it.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.920]   But you're right, with the iMac, the first one, the colored ones, they really promoted
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   USB.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.080]   That helps get USB off the ground.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.800]   And they might do the same thing here.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.200]   There are a lot of these like little delightful features where it's not a game changer like
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:40.360]   having having a two pound 13.1 millimeter laptop, but things like you will have to buy one cable
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   and that's it.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.960]   And whatever source you want to find for that one kind of cable, that's it.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.720]   And it's not going to be a case where like I was in a couple of months ago where I needed
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   it.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   I had two devices.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   One was lightning.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.440]   One was micro USB.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.680]   And of course it was the it was the Apple cable I couldn't find.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.560]   And it was batteries going down, down, down.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.000]   I had a big, big juice box.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.520]   It was no problem plugging into that, but I could not find that cable.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.040]   And I had 45 minutes before meeting to find some store that had the right cable could
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.240]   not find it.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.400]   Just the again, little bits of delight that you no longer have to have multiple cables.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   You no longer have to worry about, can I find this one proprietary thing in a drug store
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.680]   and an office store, anything like that.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.840]   So that's little bits of delight that really make the experience so much better.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.000]   And since Mark, you're here, we're going to quote Jordan Kahn from nine to five meg
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   an hour.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.480]   Or I could just tell you, I mean, I was going to say it's a big deal because third party
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.800]   accessory developers weren't allowed to use MagSafe, which is still on the Mac.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.560]   So they never even licensed MagSafe.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.840]   It wasn't even a question of license.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   They just said no.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.080]   No, not only did they never license it, they actually went after some accessory makers
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:51.520]   and battery pack developers who tried making their own MagSafe adapters by cutting and
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.680]   putting together some of Apple's cords.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.160]   But now anyone who makes an external battery pack will be able to sell something geared
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.400]   towards this new Mac.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.320]   Well, I wouldn't really even have to get a new one if you just get the USB type two to
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.800]   the USB or whatever it's called type B to USB type C. Is it A?
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   What happened to B?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.240]   I guess data B, I forget.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   They make it from new to old, right?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   So you could, I guess it would have to have enough wattage to move the needle.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   We don't know.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.160]   We just don't know because nobody has a MacBook line.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.880]   Well, Apple's adapters have power and they split it apart several of their adapters so
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.920]   you can plug in power and you can plug in the video or you can plug in the adapter.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:39.160]   I need to, since I have the Pixel, I need to go out and buy that old USB to type C cable
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.240]   and just try this and see what happens.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.120]   I believe B is the micro USB and A is the full.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.480]   So C is this new one.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.880]   Got it, got it, got it.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.000]   So what an A to C would be very useful.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.320]   My camera tool uses the Mini USB, which is Pauling.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.520]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.720]   Yeah, that was, yeah.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   Thank God that's gone.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.400]   Yeah, I have a lot of stuff with that and it's like, oh crap, now I got a dead, it's
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   impossible to find now.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.320]   You have like 800 Mini USB cables and no micro and no mini plugs anymore.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.040]   Can we just stop the insanity?
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.400]   The hyper-juicers battery packs for instance will work.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:20.360]   But this is Jordan's article at 9FI, but what you'd really want, I think, is how many
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.840]   watts does that MacBook draw do we know?
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   Power?
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   Good enough.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.880]   You'd need something that would, it's like charging an iPad from the old USB.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.680]   You can't because it's too slow or there's that something Apple says because in some
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.960]   devices you can kind of trickle, it just won't charge very fast.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.960]   Trical charges.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Oh well.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.840]   But again, any drop of water in a desert.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.960]   So how about the force trackpad?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.440]   First thing, thing of a jiggy.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.000]   We got somebody, anybody get one yet?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.560]   Because you can get it on the new MacBook.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.600]   I had that, I've been having conversations with my contacts at Apple and I had my first
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.040]   experience with a force touch trackpad and I had to have the dumbest conversations.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.840]   Sometimes I just have to abject myself to make sure I'm understanding things properly.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.480]   And I'd ask three times in a row with three different kinds of phrasing.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.200]   You're saying there's nothing mechanical like you underneath this trackpad.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   Wow.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.600]   So what I'm saying is that if I were to, if I were to cut the power to this MacBook and
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.920]   I were to press my finger down on the trackpad as hard as I can and then press my finger down
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.760]   on the table as hard as I can, I couldn't feel the difference between the two.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.120]   Nope, absolutely not.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:40.880]   Because the sensation of feeling a click underneath my finger was so potent that I'm like, I'm
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.520]   about to say that this is one of the most incredible tactile experiences I've had with
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.280]   a computer and I don't want someone to say, yeah, actually there is a little like spring
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   underneath it.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   Okay, sorry.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   It feels like it.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   It's cool.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   It's really tricky.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.680]   So has anybody got the new 13 inch MacBook Pro?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   Has anybody actually, I fix it, tore it down, of course.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.360]   So they're at the Apple store.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.160]   So if you want to check them out for yourself, I believe that they've all been replaced.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.840]   So I, and again, I did so many Gestalt checks on that to make sure I had the new one.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.800]   So if you want anyone can go check it out right now.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.160]   I might run that.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.400]   That's so interesting, isn't it?
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.560]   That it really tricks you.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.520]   Well, it says like, I think they call it appropriate reception and it's just like your
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.160]   body doesn't understand sensation the way you think it does, which kind of messes with
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   your mind.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.920]   The thing that surprised me was that there's actually sort of a two stage sensation.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.760]   So if you press down a little hard, you feel a click.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.720]   If you press down harder, you feel a second click.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.760]   So so there's that's a way of transmitting.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.600]   Okay, I understand that you're pressing harder now.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   That's nice.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.360]   Which which really again, it was such an impressive demo that I just can't get over it.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   That's really good.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   You do the desktop or you do quick time.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.840]   You can get I think three or four levels of that, which just blows your mind because
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.320]   you feel like you've pushed all the way and there's a little bit of resistance that you
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.200]   can go further and further and developers can map that out.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   There's like a range of sensitivity and they can pull out points on there to make them
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.360]   feel like click levels.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.800]   That's my only level of concern.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.680]   It's going to be hard to create a new language for this kind of force click.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.040]   You can go into iMovie.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.800]   iMovie is now wired up so that it will respond to a force click on when you're scrubbing forward
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.920]   or backward with a little forward and backward buttons.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   It was not innately easy for me to figure out how much force I'm applying versus how
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.080]   much faster I want it to go.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.520]   I would actually much rather have seen some sort of a visual slider that or tap it once
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.120]   or tap it twice, tap it three times to look on your T-vode, fast forward it faster or
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   slower.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.240]   I think we're going to have maybe a few growing pains as we figure out what that should map
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   to in the human mind, but the technology works like a charm.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   Mark, what I'm going to do is I'd love to have it hooked up to Mars edit so you could
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.800]   press the publish button, force click it to vlog angry.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   That would be nice.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.680]   I haven't used Mars edit so hopefully maybe they'll have a web API for developers to add
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   it to websites.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   We're pressed along angry.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.440]   You have to use a web CMS to post a 9 to 5.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Maybe.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.440]   Yes.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.440]   I mean, I don't have to.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   That's good because then you couldn't use anything anywhere.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.440]   Right.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.040]   But my colleague Dom from 9 to 5, he picked up one of the new 13s with Force Touch and
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   he really likes it so far.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.720]   So I was quick to learn he put up a really cool video 15 cool tricks you can do with
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   the trackpad.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.880]   It's really helpful for panning around in maps and in 10.10.3, which is the next update
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.800]   to Yosemite to Mac operating system.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.560]   If you force touch a certain way, I believe it's with three fingers, you can get additional
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   context.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.160]   So if you force touch on a website link in Safari, you could actually load up the website
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.560]   as a pop up over the current website so you don't actually leave what you're doing.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   You can quickly browse the website you want to click through to before actually going
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.440]   to that page.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.640]   So it's not only the perception of it and the technology side, but it actually will
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   speed up some of the stuff that you do every day on the computer, which is a pretty big
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   deal.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.320]   And it's going to be interesting to see how this translates to the iPhone.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.880]   This here in the iPad eventually.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.920]   Well, I was going to ask you what your sources tell you guys how generalized both Type C
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.760]   and Force Touch will be.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.840]   Force touch, I mean, it's not going to be as generalized as Type C because you won't
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.400]   see Google picking this up through an Apple built technology.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.960]   But I believe the goal is to put Force Touch as the next big Apple technology.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.600]   So like we saw Siri start with the iPhone and move on to other devices in the same way
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.840]   Touch ID.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   The next one's Force Touch.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.960]   So you're going to see it on the watch in April.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.480]   You're going to see it on the MacBook.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.440]   And you already see it on the MacBook Pro.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.800]   And the iPhone will be the next spot for Force Touch.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.520]   You'll see that when they announced the new phone around September.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.240]   That's going to be one of the cornerstone features.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.600]   And they'll have a former Force Touch for the iPad Pro as well to sense different types
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.800]   of pressure for some apps.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   The really big deal here is going to be with what developers are able to do with it.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.840]   The trackpad on the MacBook is small comparatively.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.120]   It's about the size of an iPhone.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.000]   But like on an iPad, you'll be able to do some crazy stuff with different drawing apps
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.480]   and productivity and movie editing and creative stuff.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.560]   So I think Force Touch on the Mac is nothing to what it's going to be on the iPad and the
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.760]   iPhone eventually.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.960]   I love that idea.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   I really do.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   Some super industry.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.520]   All this stuff is based on 20 year old research.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.000]   I forget the ladies name, but Red Victor was tweeting about it during the show.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.840]   But Disney is doing some crazy stuff with this too.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   And you can start right now.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.160]   Apple is letting you push in, but sometimes things can push back.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.440]   And we can get to a point where the glass is like there's like there's a lot of research
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.840]   on simulating buttons or simulating piano keyboards or simulating things.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.760]   So your fingers feel like there's actual keys on a glass surface.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.440]   And that might assuage a lot of people's problems with typing on glass.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.360]   It's going to be a super interesting technology.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.040]   Push back.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.440]   So you say, I love how Mark goes.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.920]   Just oh yeah, you know the iPad Pro.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.680]   So you feel pretty confident that's coming.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.640]   And it's what we've heard like the 12.9 in 12.9 inch with force.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.400]   Well, they were testing 12.2 and 12.9.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.800]   So I'd say just under 13 is fair to say somewhere in there.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.640]   And you don't think till this fall though, they're not going to do a mid mid year update.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.080]   No, I mean, the mid years already really, really packed some stuff they're planning for June.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.560]   We can talk about that if you want.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:35.320]   But I'd say the iPad Pro toward the fall is going to be is going to be one of the highlights
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.800]   of the fall because the iPhone update is not going to be huge as last year.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.720]   It's going to be more of an S cycle upgrade.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.480]   So they'll put a lot of attention to the iPad seeing that, you know, the iPad hasn't really
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.960]   had a big update since 2013.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.360]   Can they get rid of the home button?
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.720]   Could they do fingerprint on the screen somehow?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.040]   So they've actually been working on that for, I believe it's already been two years to be
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.080]   able to do touch ID in the screen.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.000]   But that's actually quite far away because they have to embed the cameras in between
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.840]   the pixels in the actual display.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.440]   But they are working on that.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.360]   They were actually working on that when they were developing the first Apple watch.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.560]   So one of the things they wanted to do was incorporate touch ID into the screen because
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.640]   there's no room for a home button.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.800]   But the technology is far from ready for mass consumption.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.360]   So I'd say probably within three, four years we'll have touch ID in the screens across the
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   the bike lineup.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.080]   We're going to take a break because I want to know more about June.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.640]   I was about ready to buy something.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   I don't know.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   Maybe I should stop.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.880]   Got Mark German on.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.280]   You can tell us.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.640]   Actually, Renee Richie is no slouch in the rumor department either.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.040]   Andy and I just sit in here ignorant.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.360]   No, you're, I'm sure you have your sources as well.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.120]   I don't, I'm, I'm so envious.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.680]   People tell me things, but they do so with the understanding that I'm not going to write
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   about it.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Right.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.600]   So it's basically me from saying stupid things like, Oh, you know, I think today is definitely
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.120]   the time to buy a new iPad because Apple's not doing anything interesting in the future.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   So I see you.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   That's not handy.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   No, it is.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   It's so fun.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.200]   How do you get your sources to let you do that, Mark?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   How do you do that?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.760]   This is Mac break weekly, not Mark break legally.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   So I'm sorry.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.920]   Oh, see, he's not going to reveal any of his magic.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.200]   I'll let you have my Malachi ball.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.360]   All right.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   I can show you the ball first.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.080]   I can't see it.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.920]   I'll show you mine.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.880]   If you show me yours, coming up in just a second, we're going to find out what's coming
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   in June.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.440]   Mark Gurman is here from nine to five.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.400]   Mac Renee Richie, I'm more calm Andy Anaco Chicago.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.560]   Sometimes I have my sources.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   It's you guys.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   That's all I need.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.720]   I just ask you guys every week.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   What's going on?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   What's happening?
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   What's the latest?
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   That's why I do Mac break weekly.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.160]   So I keep up on this stuff.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.560]   It's funny how I rate.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.280]   I'm sure Paul Thorey will be.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.880]   But high rate, high rate windows users are.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.120]   I've been seeing this in the chair.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.640]   Apple did not invent Type C. There's not even the first product with Type C.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.560]   The plus was horrible too today.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.600]   I did not invent it.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.880]   Nobody, an industry standard, no one company is ever going to be responsible for.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.720]   It's their ideas that get put on the table.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   Right.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   Let's see.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   But isn't this historically funny?
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.680]   So you have, to a large extent, Apple fans who don't know what they're talking about
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.440]   saying that well, you know that Apple completely invented the USBC and then windows and like
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.320]   Android people who don't know what they're talking about saying, hey, Apple had nothing
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   to do with it.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   It was an industry standard.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.680]   It's like, can you just like shut up and chill, man.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   Chill, dudes.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.600]   There's a lot of great things on TV and Netflix.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   What you think about something in common?
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   Chill.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   Are you angry about Mac?
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   What's it?
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.280]   I was watching Netflix the other night watching a house of cards.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.680]   As a matter of fact, no spoilers.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   Don't worry.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   I say the words.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   House of cards.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   Everybody goes, no spoilers.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:02.520]   But at the end and the credits, it says thanks to Shutterstock.com.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.280]   And I thought, what?
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.080]   But I realized Shutterstock isn't, and we talk about Shutterstock all the time, the place
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.600]   to go for royalty free photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.320]   This is kind of interesting because House of cards is shot by in on red cameras in 4K,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.520]   probably 5K, and they're able to use clips from Shutterstock because Shutterstock has
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.120]   those high res clips.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.960]   Save yourself running a helicopter and getting aerial shots of Washington DC.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.160]   Go to Shutterstock.com.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.120]   Whatever your image needs are, Shutterstock is a great place to take your creative projects
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.720]   to the next level.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.440]   49 million, actually it's now 50, I think, high quality stock photos, illustrations,
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.880]   vectors and video clips.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   It goes up all the time.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.960]   They add 370,000 images every week, whether it's for your website, your publication, and
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:57.520]   your advertisement, your next HBO TV series, your Netflix original Shutterstock, it's a
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.000]   place more people use all the time to get great images.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.920]   And I find sometimes an image can inspire a blog post.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.680]   That's why I invite you to create your free account at Shutterstock.com.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   You don't even need to use a charge card, no credit card needed.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.800]   That'll allow you to do the search the entire collection.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.960]   They've got great search tools.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:22.360]   Give images that inspire you or excite you or just bring your chimes to their light box.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.720]   You can share the light box, look at it later.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:31.000]   I find it a very nice way to keep imagery in somewhere I can collect it and look at it.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Their iPad app is really great for that.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.600]   It's just fun to browse.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.120]   You can download any image in any size and you pay just one price.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.040]   Choose for individual image packs or a monthly subscription.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.280]   That's what we have.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   That's the best deal.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.800]   You get 25 images a day.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.600]   A lot of publications do that.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   I don't know if 95 does, but a blog typically will do that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.440]   And then they say, whenever you use images, please use these royalty free images.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.800]   You're going to love it.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.880]   It's totally international.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.120]   They've got multilingual customer service in more than a dozen countries, full-time
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.920]   customer support throughout the week.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   Keycat.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.960]   Doggy, heen, heen.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.080]   The search is great because you can search by emotion, by gender, by whether there's
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.280]   people in it.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.840]   So you can say, I want cats, but there has to be two people in it and the cat has to be
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.600]   happy, but the people have to be sad.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   It's really kind of amazing.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.480]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.640]   No credit card needed to start your account and begin using it to help imagine what your
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.800]   next text project could be like.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.400]   Save your images to the light box.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.040]   Once you decide to purchase, by the way, we have a new offer code.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.720]   The old one does not work for some reason.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.280]   I want you to use a new one.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   Macbreak 0315.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.120]   Macbreak 0315.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.560]   And you want that offer code because that's going to get you 20% off an image subscription
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.000]   package with your new account.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.800]   That is a great deal.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   20% off.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.600]   Macbreak 0315.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.320]   It's Shutterstock.com.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.040]   We use the clips, the video clips, because you have video clips with transparent alpha
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.240]   channels, so you can use them like overlay and put it on the video and stuff.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.280]   All right, Mark Gurman, 9-5, Mac.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.720]   It's coming in June.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.080]   So WWDC is in June, right?
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   That's right.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.800]   And I believe the keynote is Monday, June 8th.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.320]   So that's been planned for a while.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.360]   They have their whole schedules on the Moscone website under corporate event.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.680]   So that's a known thing that Apple's been planning this year's conference for June 8th
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.160]   through that week.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.920]   Good, I'll set that day aside.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.080]   What do you think they'll be talking about?
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.200]   Yeah, so I'm thinking it's going to be a really jam-packed.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.800]   It's a year for the developers' conference.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.160]   We reported that they're going to be unveiling their new streaming music service using the
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   Beats technology.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.360]   They want you to hear the Beats name you think?
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   I doubt it.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.240]   I mean, maybe they'll call it Apple Beats or iBeats or something like that.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.280]   I particularly think it's a cool name.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.520]   I like Apple Beats.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   That's actually a good name.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.080]   Apple Pan, Apple Beats, Apple Pi.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   Apple Pan, Douty.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   Apple Beats.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   Apple Beats.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   Apple Beats.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   Apple Beats.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   Oh, you're right.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   I doubt it.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.480]   It'll probably be called Apple Music or just it'll be the music app, the new feature for
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.400]   the music app or something like that.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.480]   But it's kind of time to rebrand iTunes too.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.920]   In fact, this would be a great time to just throw iTunes out the window.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   Right.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.280]   You know, I don't think that's happening this year, to be honest.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.720]   I think that this is just going to be a part of iTunes.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.560]   So I don't see that changing.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.280]   It's basically going to be, if you've used the Beats music app, when you loaded it up
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.400]   for the first time, there's a bunch of floating bubbles where you get to choose different
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.480]   genres and artists that you're interested in.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.560]   And then once you're in there, there's a few menus where you can create your own playlist
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   based on your mood and what you're doing.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.680]   And you can browse through different curated playlists based on certain artists, curators
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.800]   who are known in the music industry and different genres.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.840]   Like this EDC radio guy they hired, right?
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   Right.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   Right.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.840]   So, you know, we can do that with radio.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.200]   I mean, I think radio is underutilized and really good, but I presume this would add
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.680]   to iTunes radio app.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   That's not going away.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.080]   They're going to keep that too.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.480]   And that's going to be...
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.000]   Let's get to using.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.280]   I think they'll separate it well.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.600]   I think iTunes radio is just going to be a feature that's remaining there and they'll
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.960]   probably up the curation with the higher of that DJ from England.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.320]   Kind of overlaps, though, doesn't it?
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   Not really.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.680]   It's streaming music service, which is really a replacement for the actual music library
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.200]   that would be used to on the iPhone.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.280]   It'll basically just make your library, a cloud-based library, where you can add tracks
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:50.040]   from the cloud library and then put different mixes and curation onto that.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.920]   And you'll be able to have playlists and all that.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.760]   And iTunes radio, I guess, will be similar in regards to the custom playlists.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.120]   So they'll probably blend the iTunes radio feature with a feature called Descendants,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.880]   which is from Beats Music of Today.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   That's such a weird feature.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.000]   It'll overlap in that regard.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.280]   I tend to like it.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.120]   It works well for me.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.840]   You make a sentence where you say, "I want to boogie down with my homies, with my pants
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.720]   off to EDN the music while watching a podcast."
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Something like that.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.000]   So they'll probably blend those together.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.720]   I think that makes a lot of sense, only the iTunes radio with that.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.600]   But iTunes radio as a whole won't go away, nor will iTunes match.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.720]   So it's going to be another leg to the service.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.360]   Still have to clean it up eventually.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.560]   But as of right now, the plan is to completely upgrade the music app that comes with the
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.960]   iPhone and update iTunes to a new version of iTunes 12.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.440]   So it's not going to be a total revamp.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   It's just going to be integrated into the current system.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.480]   So maybe next year or year after, iTunes will go away.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.120]   But right now, the plan is just to get the streaming music service out there.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.240]   It's to be seen what it launches with and what it exactly launches.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.000]   So they'll announce it in June.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.880]   And they haven't decided yet if they're going to release it in iOS 8.4 update or an iOS 9
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   update.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.920]   I think they'll know closer to June whether--
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.280]   Well, that's interesting, because 9.4 is actually in September with the new iPhone.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   Right.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.080]   I think it will depend on when they get the record labels struck and when the technology
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   is ready.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.000]   We've been hearing for weeks now that they're having a lot of internal problems getting
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.520]   the new streaming service out the door.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.240]   Lots of people are leaving the head of engineering for the music service who was the senior VP
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:44.040]   of technology at Beats prior to the acquisition left at the end of 2014.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.600]   A lot of the Android developers have already left.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.480]   Those are the people working on Apple's first Android app, which is the music service.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.040]   What's going on?
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.680]   You know, they're just not happy.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.760]   They're not happy with the integration between Beats and Apple has not gone as well.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:04.120]   Well, these were Beats guys that came over with Beats, but there was a corporate-- I'm
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.520]   sure-- you know, that happens all the time.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.720]   There's a corporate mismatch at culture.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Right.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   Right.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.840]   And when the merger initially happened, there were layoffs in the hundreds of people.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.680]   But those weren't really developers on the technical side.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.920]   That was more of different staff.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   You need those hand-rails.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   You need those hand-rails.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   You really do.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.920]   Right.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.360]   So, I mean, there's a possibility that the Android app will be delayed because of-- I
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.760]   know it-- Renee doesn't like the word delayed, but the plan is for the Android app to be announced
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.520]   with everything else, but it could be delayed if they don't have enough developers to finish
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   it up.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   What's wrong with the word delayed, Renee?
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   You know, like that?
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.400]   Well, we had no-- Mark and I have these discussions sometimes about semantics.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.920]   And mostly my concern is that I deal with people in my comments who then, like, they
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.560]   build up a tremendous amount of expectation on debt.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.600]   Like, they see a button, and if that button doesn't ship, they get really upset because
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.200]   someone stole their button.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.400]   So I like to just make sure that I'm really clear when something is like development cycle,
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.880]   because everyone in a development cycle knows that you can't predict a timeline ahead of
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.800]   time because you've never done it before.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.000]   It's all new and things move around and they shift.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.160]   And that's different than the white iPhone or some other things where it's announced and
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.560]   this is the date it's coming and then it just doesn't come that day.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.280]   Like, that's a very public sort of delayed.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.000]   I mean, the only difference here is that, like, one is a public timeline and one is an
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   internal timeline.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.560]   Their internal timeline and internal hopes could be delayed.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   It's just that.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   Absolutely.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.360]   That's like the developer of any apps.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   You make an app, you're going to have a-- I'm going to finish this app in four weeks and
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.000]   you finish it in six weeks and nobody ever knows because you're not Apple.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Right.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   It's still a delay.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Right.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Spiritual delay.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.720]   That's why it's internal versus external delay.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   I just like to make it--
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   I know, that's good to clarify that.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   I understand that now.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.960]   And I also understand why.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.800]   The key commenters might drive you crazy.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.720]   Well, we had the same thing last week when they were talking about the invitation for
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.760]   the beta for iOS and a bunch of people didn't get it and they were super angry about it.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.760]   Right.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.680]   I went through and said, "Not everybody is getting it."
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   You mark sources are fantastic.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   Apple didn't say that.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   It's just--
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   Right.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   Well, no, they sent out invitations.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.920]   I called it invitation only, mark all the public.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   It's both correct.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.520]   It's just-- I have a ton of 50 people saying, "Where's mine?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   Where's mine?
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   Where's mine?"
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.560]   And I want to make sure they know that not everyone's going to get it.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.760]   Only some of you.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.320]   What else at WWDC will we see?
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   So iOS 9.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.680]   They'll-- yeah, that's-- you can expect that because they want developers to take a look.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   Right.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.840]   There's going to be a big focus in iOS 9 on stability and performance.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   They might even announce that as a homework feature, but the developers at Apple were
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.760]   working on iOS 9, which is code name Monarch.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.040]   They're really focusing on that with everything they do.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.760]   So as they're adding new features, it's not all about adding new features.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.240]   It's about really adding new features with making sure that the core is broken or nothing
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.640]   else is getting affected, which has really been their problem over the last three years
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.920]   or so with iOS 7 and iOS 8, when they've been constantly adding new features and support
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.400]   for new hardware features.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.760]   So they're really taking a step back with iOS 9.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   Kind of a--
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   And snow leopardy kind of a thing?
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.200]   Yeah, that's-- so a few sources put it, that it's more of a snow leopard type of thing.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.840]   And Apple had no problem marketing.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.520]   Snow leopard is an OS at no new features.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.440]   So they won't have a problem doing that again.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   But that's not entirely--
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.680]   Oh, I think they'd make a lot of people really happy.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   No, I know.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.200]   As I'm saying, that's not entirely going to be a case here.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   I would be sure.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.120]   Will still be new features.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.920]   So maps, they're ready to give transit another try.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.600]   They tried last year with iOS 8.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.280]   They ended up pulling it at the last minute.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.360]   It's transit.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.960]   So transit directions and maps.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.920]   So you'll be able to get navigations between bus stops and all that subways.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.200]   So they're progressing quickly on that, and they're moving towards that.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.040]   So it's probably highly likely that they'll talk about that finally this year.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   A new OS 10?
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.840]   Or they have had a yearly update schedule, which maybe is too fast too much.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   So OS 10 11 is also in the works.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.720]   And they're actually switching up the code names this year.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.840]   So usually they call them wines internally.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.200]   I think they ran out of wines.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Like they ran out of cats.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.280]   Oh, you can never run out of wine, my friend.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.720]   Now they're moving to apples, which is.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.360]   OS 10 V on yay.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.280]   There are fewer apple varieties than there are wine varieties, dudes.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   So they'll move on to something else.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.640]   But this first apple one is going to be a gala.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   So a gala.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   Gala, gala.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.200]   But they'll stick with the Granny Smith maybe.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.640]   The public name will be California Landmark again though, I presume.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   Yes.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   Yes.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   Okay.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   They.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   And is that for this year?
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   Is that scheduled for this year or next?
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:43.520]   Um, you know, from what I understand, they're not as far on 10 11 as they are with iOS 9.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   But I still think they're going to stick to that yearly schedule.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   We'll see.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.800]   But I don't see why they wouldn't at this point.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.640]   I really think that's a bad idea.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.080]   Talk about expectations Renee to say we're going to do, you know, set up an expectation
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   we're going to do it yearly.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.480]   I was a great explanation from a former Apple program director who said that you have a
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.840]   bag and it just takes a certain amount of time to fill it.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.560]   So if you have less time, you put less in it.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.520]   And I think that that's the way going forward.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.640]   If they want to keep a yearly schedule is just don't schedule as many.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   Your bag.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   So you can still do that update.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   You can still push out 10.11 or dollar.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.600]   But you don't put all the things in it.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.440]   You might have previously wanted to put in it.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.880]   Hey, new Ipods coming out in June.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880]   What do you think?
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   New Ipods?
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   What are you laughing at 2005?
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.400]   I just never heard the word iPod spoken in a podcast in the number.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   It just gave me this nice burst of like 2008 nostalgia.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.120]   It's called an Apple watch now Leo and it ships in April.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   You mean never again.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.800]   We'll be able to say the new Ipods are here.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.960]   The new Ipods are here.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.080]   We are back to like 1000 songs in your pocket.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.440]   Only now it's on your wrist.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.840]   Good news by the way.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.640]   Red Bob in our chat rooms has checked Wikipedia.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.400]   There are 7,500 varieties of Apple.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.640]   Rayburn.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.920]   So a little bit more things on your favorite.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.920]   Rayburn.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.040]   Actually, I'm a bag of gala.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.440]   I love the gala.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:17.320]   There's a new one that I think is probably genetically engineered called Honeycrisp.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   That's a good name, right?
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   You doesn't know what you want.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   That's one McDonald's.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   Don't you want to eat a honey crisp?
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   Too many cereal box connotations.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.600]   Stop eating those honeycrisp.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   So what are they going to just kill the iPod?
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.640]   Just do away with it.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   Ever?
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.680]   Well, the classics already dead.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.360]   I don't think that they're going to get rid of the touch.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.080]   The touch they need to keep up to date, right?
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   Because that's...
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.080]   Well, it's not up to date.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.080]   It's...
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   Let's see.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.880]   They haven't meaningfully updated the touch since 2012 with the fifth gen.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.600]   And that's still on the A5 chip, which was from 2011.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.560]   It's kind of ironic that the MacBook has a worse camera than the...
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   2012 touch.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.760]   So yeah, they're really behind on the touch.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.600]   And maybe they'll update it specs-wise, but for that price.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.120]   And I was going to say they really should lower the price on that and they could probably
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.560]   make a killing on Christmas shelves if they slashed it to $99 for maybe an 8 gigabyte
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   model with the smaller screen and all that because the pricing of components and manufacturing
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   costs typically goes down after they've been producing it for a certain amount of time.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.760]   So perhaps they'll do that, but I don't see them...
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   I don't know.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   I think they'll either way.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.680]   They can either do a pretty significant update or they can do a price cut.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   I'd love to see...
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.000]   I'd love to see high res playback.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.520]   Is that too much of a niche for us?
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   It'd be interesting to see if like over time Apple Watch becomes more like iPod and there
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.240]   are devices for people who don't necessarily need screens the same way there are iPods
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.600]   for people who don't necessarily need screens and just want fitness tracking.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.600]   I just want something else.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.840]   Storage on my phone has become less and less important as I move more to streaming music.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.160]   I don't store as much on my phone and maybe that's what Apple's saying is, "Well, why
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.880]   even bother having a storage device for music when you could stream any song you want
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880]   anytime?"
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.640]   Well, I don't think that's entirely the case because like with this new streaming service
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.960]   there's still going to be a significant offline component.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.920]   So you'll be able to download and store any of those streaming songs.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   Right.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.600]   You'll be able to make a switch there and if you flick the switch you'll be able to save
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.240]   any playlist or portion of your library that you've got.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240]   That's what Google does now.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.640]   That's what Amazon does now.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.760]   It's near-line, it's like what the Photos app does, it's what iTunes matches.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.920]   What they want is to have the most frequently used favorite stuff that they believe you're
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   going to want instantly on the device for you and then everything else gets kept offline
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.840]   so you have a much larger library available but it's not keeping up storage.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.560]   And then it's like a fusion drive on a Mac.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   It intelligently manages really fast, really available with really big, almost available.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.520]   It's interesting to see how all these devices kind of disrupt how people would plan to buy
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:01.560]   devices because with all these streaming services now there's less of a rational demand
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.200]   for a 128 gig iPad or even a 64 gig iPad.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.480]   Not only that but if people really catch on to the watch, if that is now their first
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.880]   point of contact with their phone maybe they're going to be, it's going to take them next
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.720]   to a year or an extra two years to realize that, "Gee, I've got this iPhone 5s in my
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.280]   pocket, it's looking kind of ratty, it's not the new flashy one."
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.960]   Well you've got the flashy watch that's giving you all these new features that would have
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.400]   slaked your thirst for a new phone so maybe we'll start to see instead of people replacing
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:35.680]   phones every two, three or four years now every three, four or five years.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   I know that's the case.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.040]   Are you saying that because of the Apple watch upgrades for the iPhone will slow down?
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.120]   I'm not predicting anything but I think it's kind of interesting that my own experience
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.880]   with my Moto 360 for instance is that whereas I was pretty much planning on buying a brand
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.120]   new phone this winter or this spring, now I'm like actually a lot of the problems that
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   I was having with my old phone are kind of negated by having this watch.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.640]   Also you have kind of an itch to sort of upgrade something and have something better
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.880]   for your experience and now I don't feel quite as compelled to go to a new phone and also
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.560]   whereas I used to basically tell people buying an iPad back when 64 was the top that get
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.400]   as much storage as you possibly as you can rationally afford because it really stinks
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.120]   if you want to pack a lunch so to speak for a couple of days and you can't put the movies
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.720]   you want to get on there.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.800]   Now that you're getting a lot of their stuff streamed and so effortless there's not that
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   compelling sort of thing.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.760]   I'm just sort of interested to see in the next two or three years how the popularity of
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.240]   an Apple Watch is going to affect people's buying decisions going forward.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:47.680]   Right, I mean my concern is that like future generations of the Apple Watch and even Moto
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.920]   smart watches and from other companies is how much they're going to require new phone
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.800]   hardware as well to take advantage of the new features.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.080]   So let's say maybe the iPhone 5 won't be compatible with the third or fourth generation
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.960]   Apple Watch so you'll need to upgrade your phone in order to make it compatible.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.440]   So I think this is going to become a cycle for Apple.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.760]   They're going to get people to upgrade their hardware on both ends and even make higher
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.080]   margins and more money.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.600]   So I think this is a big marketing and operational play as well.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.720]   Yeah, Mark said it a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.840]   a little bit a little bit about how you know what Tim Cook's goal is to sell even more
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.200]   iPhones and for me when you look at Apple Watch you look at home kit you look at car
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.760]   play all of these things take the logic from your phone but put the interface somewhere
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   else.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.880]   So I feel like I'm going to be updating even if I weren't already I'd be updating even more
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.280]   frequently because it's easier to update my phone than my car.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.420]   I might keep the watch for a couple generations get the new phone because I get all the
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.600]   benefits of that sort of projected interface and interactivity.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   Well that's interesting.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.040]   You think Apple will be thinking that way as well that it won't update the watch.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   I think that's why.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.280]   Well I don't know if they'll update the watch or not as fast but you're not going to update
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.920]   your car as often as you'll update your phone to get better car play.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.400]   But I think that you get better airplay.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.680]   But I kind of think that that's an interesting point is that if you update the phone the
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.520]   watch gets an update in a way.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.200]   But where's the where's the pain point at what point do you say that I'm sick and tired
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.280]   of dealing with this fill in the blank I'm going to buy a new one right now for the
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.940]   I think that when the major dividing lines previously was does this have Bluetooth L or
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.220]   does this not have Bluetooth.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   Right.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.660]   And that's the sort of stuff where you see friends who have an iPad that can do really
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.260]   wonderful things just with proximity that the earlier generation device can't have even
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.100]   though they can both run iOS 8.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.980]   I do hope that people get weaned off this idea of new shiny shiny must have the new
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.460]   shiny shiny because I think that's a very counterproductive.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:33.100]   And I think that I hope this really gets people's attention back on actual features and functionality.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.780]   It would really suck if the somewhere somewhere in a conference room in Cupertino the number
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:43.680]   one bullet feature of the Apple Watch 3 is that we figured out a way to make people hate
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.120]   their iPad Air 2s finally.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.100]   I hope that I hope that we can kind of slow down the upgrade cascade.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.480]   But I fear that you're right Mark.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.800]   This is so good for the bottom line that.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   Right.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.000]   And that's a huge push.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.500]   That's one of the reasons they're going to be allowing people to come into the Apple
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.780]   Store and preview the Apple Watch two weeks before it ships is because they have a whole
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:12.340]   marketing diagram for retail employees that they really want to talk to potential Apple
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   Watch customers about not only what watch they want, but if they don't have an iPhone
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:23.180]   or if they have an older iPhone model or even an iPhone 5 or 5s to convince them or push
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.980]   them to upgrade to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.500]   Yeah, we saw that leak that you had.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.100]   The last week of the instructions for retail, right?
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.900]   Encourage them to upgrade the phone.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.980]   So really, I mean, Apple has, you know, three really big pillars right now under Angela
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   Aron's retail.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.420]   That's the iPhone because of the huge margins China because they're really, really trying
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:51.740]   to grow in China and excess reason with the watch bands and we can get into that later.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.780]   The seven thousand dollar watch band.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.780]   Right.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:01.260]   So we're in transition now into talking about that new plan where Apple's opening the first
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.300]   ever Android phone trade and program.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   Yes.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   Apple stores.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.300]   So this timing is really not coincidental.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.460]   The Apple Watch requires an iPhone.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.140]   The newer iPhones provide a better experience in Apple's opinion.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.940]   So when they're showing people the Apple Watch two weeks before it comes out and they have
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.820]   an Android phone or a Windows phone, a Samsung or a BlackBerry, et cetera, et cetera, they'll
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.380]   be able to now tell them, hey, we can buy your phone back, we can recycle it and we
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.620]   will give you a gift card that you can use right now toward a new piece of iPhone hardware.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:37.420]   So this is an entire cycle about buying people into the ecosystem and unlocking them in there.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:42.900]   So this is a really big approach and I think that Apple's pulling this off because of how
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:48.140]   well connected their marketing and hardware divisions and software are all together.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   Your article in nine to five max is the Apple employee will be the one to determine the
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.900]   trading value of the old phone.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.900]   Right.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.820]   So they're going to have their easy pay system and what they'll be able to do is plug in
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.780]   information about the phone, the brand, the operating system, the cosmetics.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.940]   If the screen works correctly, there's water damage or not.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.580]   Obviously, it's not Apple hardware.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:13.060]   So they'll be able to have less specific data on the device because they're able to tap
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:17.700]   into the iPhone, not like an Android phone, but to be able to get a dollar amount and
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:22.580]   then they'll tell the customer, hey, this phone is worth 50 bucks, 100 bucks, 200 bucks.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.620]   They'll give them an Apple gift card and they will tell them that you can use this Apple
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:32.860]   gift card towards the purchase of a new iPhone 6 or 6 plus and they'll probably gain millions
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.700]   of new iPhones sales over the next couple quarters because of this new program.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.940]   You point out, it's not the first time Apple's done something like this and certainly every
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.220]   other phone company has done this.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.220]   No, it actually is.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.380]   I mean, it is the first time that Apple's doing it.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.340]   I thought they had a recycle.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.340]   They had a recycling program.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.060]   They didn't give them money for anything.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.060]   Right.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.980]   This is a new trade in program.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.660]   So this is a really big deal for Apple.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:00.640]   They're really stepping into really taking more over the mobile phone market, really taking
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.340]   anyone's phones back and giving them trade in value for it.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.140]   So I think this is going to be a major thing.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.420]   Like it's going to be a really, really big program for Apple.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.180]   Will they try to match what T-Mobile or Gazelle or others are offering?
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.380]   I mean, no.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.980]   So actually Jordan Kahn, my calling it nine to five.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.140]   He did a whole profile of Apple's iPhone trading program.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:26.740]   I believe right after it launched in the summer of 2013 for iPhones, discussing that the prices
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:30.460]   aren't as great as perhaps Amazon or some of the carriers.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:35.020]   But the convenience of being able to do this at the time of purchase in an Apple store is
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.580]   pretty much unbeatable given the amount of Apple stores there are across the world.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.420]   Very interesting.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.420]   So new Apple TV in June?
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:51.100]   New Apple TV hardware is in the works and it's been kept back by this new Web TV service
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.020]   that we're hearing a lot about this week.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.740]   The new hardware, I mean, it's basically a set-top box like the current one, but it's
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.740]   noticeably smaller.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:01.860]   It has a new remote that's actually a bit bigger with bigger buttons that are easier
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.220]   to press without actually looking at the remote.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.500]   Right now the buttons are flush with the actual controller.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.420]   So this will be an improvement.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.700]   It'll also be enhanced to have some maybe voice control features or serve as a controller
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.940]   for games of some sort.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.540]   And the new Apple TV will also have an app store.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.060]   So they're actually pushing forward on that.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.940]   They're working on that.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.860]   And the user interface will be refreshed.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.660]   Not a complete, complete overhaul, but I won't be surprised to see some universal search,
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.060]   bigger icons and such.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.140]   So they're really moving forward with the new Apple TV set-top box.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.140]   So again, it's a box, not a screen.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.780]   A box, not a screen.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   It's a box like the current Apple TV.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.780]   There's been rumors for you.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.100]   Oh, I see like a TV set.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.100]   Yeah, no, we're not doing that.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   You'll be able to plug and play.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.100]   They're not doing that.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.780]   Leo, as you know, the Apple TV has been delayed.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   Is that an internal or?
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   That's very embarrassing, very embarrassing.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.460]   It's a very complicated.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:05.020]   There's so much more to talk about.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.180]   We're really thrilled to have Mark Herman here from 9 to 5 back.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.340]   We're hearing it from the horse's mouth, so to speak.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.340]   Mark Brake weekly, we're going to call it from now on.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.780]   Renee Ritchie, iMoor.com, Andy Naco, the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.780]   There's so much more to do.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.260]   Let me do a commercial, take a break, and come back.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.300]   We have lots more to talk about.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.020]   But first, a word from SmartThings.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.420]   I know we'll talk about HomeKit and Home Automation.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.940]   SmartThings is right there smack dab in the middle of the solution because they started,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.460]   in fact, they started this with a Kickstarter project to make the SmartThings hub to solve
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.300]   the problem of how do you get?
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.460]   Talk to all these disparate devices.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.420]   You've got Hue lights and a Sonos music player.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.060]   You've got a garage door opener.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.780]   You've got a thermostat.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.420]   The SmartThings hub solves this by talking to everything.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.580]   The SmartThings, you can customize the way your Smart Devices even talk to each other
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.500]   using their free iOS, Android, or Windows phone apps.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.060]   Yes, they have Windows phone apps.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.380]   Love you, SmartThings.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.220]   All your stuff, your lights, your locks, your thermostats, your Home Security connected
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.820]   through a single app.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.220]   So you can customize the way your devices talk to one another.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.820]   Tap Goodnight on your phone.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.060]   The lights turn off.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.580]   The thermostat turns down.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.940]   The doors lock.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.780]   Set your lamps to brighten each morning at sunrise or when you want to wake up.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.860]   Even keep your home protected with SmartThings, Home Security, Motion Detection, Water Detection,
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.020]   and more.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.220]   I want you to try it.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.860]   Visit smartthings.com.

[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   what I would suggest.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.060]   One of the Home Security or Solution Kits, because you get the hub, you get a bunch of
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.380]   useful sensors depending on what you want to do.

[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.060]   And this is a good way to start.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.580]   And then of course you can add more all the time.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:13.580]   Just what I love.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.580]   Smartthings.com/twit.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:23.580]   And I'm sure to work with HomeKit.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.860]   Sure it will.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   Just a matter.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.980]   I'm pretty sure I've heard that in the news story.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:34.220]   There's a whole list of compatible products on the SmartThings page so you can see what
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.900]   it's long to.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.900]   It's a long list.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.700]   And all that stuff.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:45.860]   So tell us a little bit about will we hear more about HomeKit in June at WWDC?
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.420]   I wouldn't be surprised to see some HomeKit announcements.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.100]   Apple has been working on its own HomeKit hardware.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.580]   Not necessarily a thermostat but they've been toying with some things.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.060]   Maybe in the speakers or lighting arena.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.700]   I think or I wouldn't be surprised to see some sort of HomeKit repository.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:07.860]   Now that it's integrated with the Apple Watch and Apple TV and all that.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:14.180]   So maybe a singular app on iOS 9 where you can control your lighting and all that sort
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.940]   of like the health app and passbook on the iPhone.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.260]   So maybe like a Homebook or a HomeKit app.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.140]   Whatever you want to call it.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.820]   I think that could actually be a huge new feature on the iPhone.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.420]   Just pushing it all together.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:31.500]   Integrating those APIs and being able to control everything from one app versus having
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:35.020]   to jump between your Lutron app, your Nest app and all that.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.420]   That's so complicated.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.420]   Right.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.340]   So honestly, I think that's pretty much a given to be honest.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.580]   The HomeKit app.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:44.940]   Maybe not this year, maybe next year but it has to be coming.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.260]   They've definitely been working on this.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.260]   Let's talk.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.260]   You kind of broached the topic.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:52.180]   Let's talk a little bit about the web TV service that Apple seems to be planning in the
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.180]   fall.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.180]   Sure.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:59.380]   The Wall Street Journal has a story today that says Apple's talking with everybody but
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:05.060]   maybe has lowered their expectations as to what they might be able to do this fall.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.740]   This is always the difficult thing.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.460]   You can be Apple and you can walk into a lot of places but doesn't mean they're going
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.780]   to make a deal with you.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.660]   Historically, they negotiated for a long time with Time Warner and Comcast and didn't make
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.660]   any headway.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.820]   Now they're apparently talking to ABC, CBS and Fox.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   Right.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.180]   What about NBC?
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.180]   So NBC.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:28.860]   NBC is not in there because of the issues they're having with their parent company Comcast.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   The cable town.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.860]   Right.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.340]   But actually as we reported today, NBC still wants a piece of the pie even if they're not
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   going to be part of that new web TV service.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.420]   So basically they're just going to use the legacy tech.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   You'll be able to hook up your cable network login through your cable account through an
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:51.020]   NBC Apple TV app and just get all the NBC content.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.420]   But as the source said today, it's not purely Hulu style.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.740]   It's also going to be a live streaming app with local affiliates as well.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.900]   So it's going to be cool.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:05.700]   But again, it doesn't solve any problems here because you'll be just still connected
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.700]   to cable.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.180]   What Apple's trying to do this fall and they're according to the journal, they're wanting
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.620]   to announce it in June at the World Wide Developers Conference.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:18.780]   I'd say they're just trying to eliminate that completely and have one subscription that
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:23.420]   you pay Apple a month through the iTunes store, whatnot and get the channels you want all
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:31.340]   a cart or different packages.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:37.020]   We saw in the iTunes store first launched almost a decade ago.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.500]   The other providers will follow in due time.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.660]   We've seen this with Apple Pay.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.540]   We've seen this with countries with the App Store.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:47.220]   So Apple just needs to get the ground floor ready to go with a sizable amount of content
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.660]   and the rest of the networks will just fall into place over the next few years after that.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.740]   And this is over the top.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.340]   So this would be for a cord cutter.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.340]   Absolutely.
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.780]   This web TV would be for cord cutters.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:01.300]   But that NBC thing that I just talked about, they're not part of that.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.100]   So that wouldn't be for cord cutters.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.780]   That would be for people who have the cord in Apple TV.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   I've always-
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.220]   I mean, some TV is already like almost there.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.540]   Yeah, I'd say so.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.900]   But I mean, like this whole Apple TV model that's existed the last couple of years and
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.900]   you know, with the Google TV and the Amazon Fire TV, I just have found this whole process
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.900]   pointless.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.500]   It's just you're using cable anyways.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500]   It's not solving any-
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.740]   It's an interim solution.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.740]   It's an interim solution.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   It's really solving-
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   It's not an IPTV.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.300]   It's solving nothing, right?
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.300]   In my opinion.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.780]   I mean, it's good for Netflix, good for Beats, good for iTunes, good for Amazon Prime content,
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.780]   good for all that, like different internet-based TV shows.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:49.700]   And I think these apps from NBC, ABC, Fox and HBO that are just being thrown on top of
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.860]   the Apple TV interface.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.660]   It's just the way I keep people in the Apple TV interface and the interfaces of these competing
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:58.180]   sets, all boxes because they really do nothing.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.660]   They add absolutely nothing.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:03.700]   It's the same as what you get on your cable program.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.860]   And you will still have to sign up through your cable company so that you verify with-
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.660]   At least with NBC, you'd verify it.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660]   That's for the-
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   Right.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.700]   The NBC thing is very separate from the web TV service.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   Not-
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.700]   Yeah, not Apple.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   That's gonna be all Apple.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.020]   Yeah, Apple, you won't have to have a cable company subscription for those channels.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020]   Right.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.260]   I would hope not because they're gonna charge a lot of money for it.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.580]   Right, and that's the whole point of it.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.260]   And that's why they're striking the deals.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.260]   And it's to be seen how these companies, these cable networks are looking at it math-wise
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.380]   to see if they actually think that they're gonna make more money in the long run from
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.900]   partnering up with Apple rather than sticking to this, you know, go-solo approach.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.980]   But it looks like they're willing to give in.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   And it's very helpful that Apple has all these connections with media industry.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:49.100]   They've got Bob Iger from the Disney board, or sorry, the CEO of Disney Bob Iger is on
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.100]   Apple's board.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.100]   Right.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.620]   And of course, his connections being the CEO of Disney, that puts them with ABC, that puts
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:02:01.540]   them with ESPN, a lot of other big guys, the Disney channel, Fusion, Univision, different
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.580]   foreign channels.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.980]   So I think they have a good start just with that one guy, Bob Iger on the board.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.460]   And of course, they're already talking to Fox and all those.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:14.740]   So I think the initial launch, it won't be incredible, but it's a good starting point.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:18.820]   They've been working on this for a long time with little success.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.060]   It makes you think they'll succeed now.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.860]   It really has come down to the deals and really a sense of urgency.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:29.020]   I mean, for the last couple of years, they've been pushing back on this new Apple TV hardware
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.660]   with the apps and all that, waiting to be able to go the Apple way, be able to launch
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.980]   new hardware software and services at the same time.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.420]   And I think now that they have these deals progressing and they're really pushing towards
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.420]   these and they have these new connections, it's finally going to happen.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.180]   And I think they realized that they just can't go all in anymore.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:53.420]   They can't expect they're going to launch a 1.0 with 100, 200 channels.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.300]   They're understanding that, you know, we're going to get the best of the best.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.940]   We're going to slim it down and then over time we'll build up.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940]   Sort of like Apple Pay.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.700]   They started with a couple of banks, a couple of cards and over the last few months you've
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.940]   seen it greatly expand.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.500]   Yeah, much to the chagrin of those banks.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   Yes.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.780]   Let's talk about Apple Pay.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:13.020]   Crapes on security a couple of days ago, The New York Times today, it kind of fleshed
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:18.860]   out this issue, don't feel like because you're using Apple Pay, you're at risk, Apple Pay
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.020]   is well implemented and you're not.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.220]   The issue really is more that because of the onboarding process for Apple Pay is so streamlined.
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:31.500]   That's what Apple wanted for your cards, that it makes it easy for people who have stolen
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:39.020]   credit cards to use Apple Pay to go into brick and mortar stores, buy stuff and defraud the
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020]   banks.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.100]   Particularly in big box stores, this is becoming a kind of an issue.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:51.300]   And Apple apparently, according to The New York Times, is to protect our privacy, not
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.740]   giving the banks much information when they are when you onboard a credit card.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.700]   Those reports are quasi-erksome because I think in order to shove Apple into the headline,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.500]   they take a lot of shortcuts and often the contents of the article doesn't really fit
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.580]   the narrative that they put there.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.780]   And this was happening last week, it was happening this week and it was happening so
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.300]   often and with such single-sided sources that it was really weird.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.180]   And I saw Charles Arthur, formerly of The Guardian, ask a couple of times, "Did you
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.180]   do second source this?"
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.100]   And people are like, "No, it made sense."
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.380]   We printed it a lot of the numbers.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:27.020]   And one of the parts that struck me and I forget if it was in the Wall Street Journal's
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.220]   article or one of the other ones is with the banks said that a lot of this was happening
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:34.740]   with the cards that were stolen from Home Depot and from Target and they did not destroy
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.740]   those credentials.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.500]   They didn't cancel those credentials because they thought they would lose more money off
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.620]   of doing that and off of hassling their customers than they would off fraud.
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.220]   So not only did they not cancel all these cards, but they then approved them for Apple
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.220]   Pay.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:52.460]   Ironically, Apple Pay uses a one-time token so they wouldn't have gotten these credentials
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460]   to begin with.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.940]   And I think the banks saw the fraud level and they panicked and they kind of threw Apple
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.940]   into the bus because that's the biggest headline and a lot of journalists were super happy
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.740]   and super eager to join in on that off one blog post.
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.540]   And even Cribs I think is really good.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.220]   I think there's a lot of stuff that's just missing from that.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.020]   They do acknowledge almost in a throwaway line at the end that this applies to any digital
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   wallet technology.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.380]   It's not unique to Apple Pay.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.420]   Apple Pay is just a very successful implementation of it.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   But it's super secure and the vulnerability is happening where vulnerabilities always happen
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.820]   the social engineering attack launched on banks.
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:33.220]   Apple has very detailed yellow, you know, there's green path and yellow path and green
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.180]   path is a very high likelihood that it's an authentic transaction.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:40.380]   Yellow path is where they can escalate it to customer service and they were sending people
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.980]   to customer service and set it to security.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.220]   It reads to me like this was a classic, like a massive blunder on banks part who maybe
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.100]   were not as familiar with the technology or who maybe were over eager to get their name
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.220]   associated with Apple Pay.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.340]   And I think, you know, Apple because they get a lot of attention, they get both the positive
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.020]   and negative attention off of that.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.260]   Also there's so much responsibility on the on banks shoulders.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.340]   I bought a new iPad mini just the other day and of course as soon as I provisioned it for
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.820]   Apple Pay, immediately got an email from my bank saying, Oh, do you realize that Apple
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.860]   Pay has now been connected to this new device?
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.300]   And if that's a problem, you're eight different 800 numbers to call.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.540]   So as always, the pain point has always been exactly the same.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.500]   Since the first time I started looking into credit card fraud about 15, 16, 17 years
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.140]   ago and I look at it again every three years.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.820]   And unfortunately, that's what Renee says is the absolute truth.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.020]   They do the numbers and figure out how much does it cost for us to protect our customers
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:35.700]   versus how much does it cost for us to simply read, basically cover the cost of fraud when
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.020]   our customers discover it.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.100]   And it's always less expensive just to simply say, if someone buys 10 X boxes on your credit
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:45.580]   card, let us know and we will happily pay for those criminals 10 X boxes because it's
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.660]   cost us a lot less money than better policing.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.740]   Okay.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:03.980]   Well, it's not Apple's fault, obviously, but tap to pay solutions like this make it easier
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:09.580]   for bad guys because you don't have to present the credit card or a CVV, the security code.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.300]   You just tap it.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.460]   And as long as Apple and the bank, obviously the bank has to approve this, have arranged
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:24.540]   this transaction, you can with impunity go in and charge big screen TVs and stuff.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:28.700]   You don't, the good news is, as always, at least in the US, the customer doesn't, is
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.220]   not liable for these transactions.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.180]   Ironically, Apple retail has been one of the biggest targets, you know, so they're suffering
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:39.140]   from anywhere that sells expensive stuff is going to be a target, right?
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.700]   And then the banks will have to fix this.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.940]   It's not something Apple can fix.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:48.980]   Although in the Times article, they did say that, you know, Apple to protect, I mean, is
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:53.700]   this wrong to protect our privacy was reluctant to give much information like phone numbers
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.460]   as part of the onboarding process.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.460]   It's not accurate.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.980]   Like all the stuff is public information.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.060]   You Apple has all the Apple paste stuff in a white paper.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.060]   It's in the iOS paper.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.060]   It's also on the Apple paste site and they'll give you the last four digits of the phone
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.060]   number.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.900]   They'll give you the account associated with the iTunes.
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.460]   Like they give you quite a bit of information.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:13.020]   So you give the bank enough information that it could prevent fraud if it cared.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.900]   It could look at those last four digits, match them to the account numbers, see if that's
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.100]   the address that went to the bill.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.060]   I mean, the bank has to do a little bit of work, but that's, you know, why I have a bank.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.060]   Well, that's right.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.060]   That's their job.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.060]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.380]   And again, I think those articles, like the article, the contents of the article was largely
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.180]   accurate, but the headlines and the overall narrative that they used, I think, was meant
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.100]   to make people afraid of Apple pay.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.020]   And why it irks me is that we've had a bunch of people.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.860]   We even had an accessibility writer, Steve Aquino, say like, he's hard of sight and there
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:45.100]   are people who are blind who for the first time can with confidence use a payment technology.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.900]   It changes their lives.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.060]   And this narrative is trying to make them afraid of that technology instead of afraid
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:54.860]   of the general problems with digital wallets and bank fraud in general.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.540]   So we should absolutely emphasize this.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.700]   This is not an issue that you put you at risk because you're using Apple pay.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.420]   That's not the issue at all.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.500]   The issue is people who have stolen credit card numbers may prefer to use Apple pay because
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.180]   banks are for a variety of reasons.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.180]   It's easier to get away with it, but that's not going to affect you.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.740]   No, no, no, users should be afraid of Apple pay.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.740]   You should not be afraid of Apple pay.
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:21.860]   In fact, you should use Apple pay because as you rightly point out, Renee had people
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.700]   been using Apple pay, the target heist would not have the breach would not have been an
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.700]   issue because Target wouldn't have any of that credit card information.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:32.060]   I will prohibitively use tap to pay if I can.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.140]   As a matter of fact, actually switch drugstores because if I have the option of either using
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.740]   a tap to pay system and not using it, and only have to cross the street to have a better
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.820]   payment system, I will definitely do that.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.860]   Anything more to say about the watch?
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:47.860]   It was very predictable.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:53.060]   You saw a lot of people say $17,000 douchebag watch, even my friend Kevin Rose, who's a watch
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.180]   collector and a fanatic wrote in TechCrunch that the Apple Watch, the edition is a douchebag
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.180]   detector.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.700]   What's your case?
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.500]   It's a mistake to even make a high-end watch like that.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.300]   So here's the problem I have with it.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:09.740]   I think everyone's entitled to their opinion.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.660]   If you don't like the Apple Watch, I think that's great.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.300]   If you want to make an argument as to why it's a terrible product, I think that's great.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.660]   It's the same thing with the new MacBook.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.420]   If you want to say I don't like it, perfect.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.700]   Not the right MacBook for me.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:24.860]   If you don't like that it exists and worse, if you don't like the people who like that
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.580]   it exists, I think that's bad journalism.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.700]   I don't think that should be published, especially not in major magazines because there was the
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.940]   douchebag article, there was the MacBook as a betrayal article.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:38.220]   There was an Apple security article saying in a market watch saying that someone could
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.300]   take off your arm to get around the security and they could hold you at gunpoint to get
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   your security card.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:48.140]   These are major publications that just to get a lot of attention in this story, I think
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.780]   are doing a profound disservice.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.100]   The Apple Watch edition exists because it gets Apple into high-end fashion conversations
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.900]   like Vogue China and all the fashion reporters that we saw there in Paris Fashion Week.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.780]   It also exists because there are people who just, they'll buy a $20,000 dress, they'll
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:07.900]   wear one, they'll take a $25,000 cabin trip to the Emirates.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.580]   They'll stay at a six-star or seven-star hotel.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.780]   They might be interested in Apple Watch and they're only going to buy it if it's gold.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:19.140]   It's a limited edition, it's not for everybody, but it's there for people who want it.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.940]   I would not spend that much money on a watch, but I'm not upset at all nor do I dislike
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.940]   the people who would.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.460]   I have a different point of view and that's separate from the pricing of the watch.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.020]   I just think that it's a very, very odd, I still feel it's an odd decision that Apple
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:39.100]   decided to introduce all three models, launch day at the exact same time because they had
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:45.220]   to know that introducing a X, many thousands of dollars watch was going to be a distraction
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.480]   from their primary message of launching this mysterious new object that no one has ever
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.820]   used before.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.940]   They had to know that it's going to take them at least a year to get all the bugs out, to
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:59.140]   get all the features that they were hinting at a year ago in September to actually make
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.220]   a tradition.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.180]   They had to know it's going to take a year for the app base to really catch up with this
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.020]   technology.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:09.420]   Given that the people who are going to be buying this out the gate are going to be buying it
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.420]   no matter what, these are people who bought the first iPhone, even though it wasn't a
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.660]   3G phone, even though it had a crummy camera, even though it didn't have cut and paste and
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.340]   all these sort of stuff, but they were not just early adopters, they were early believers
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.220]   and they were going to help Apple to develop the iPhone into what eventually became.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.540]   I just keep imagining a different reality in which Apple decided to just release the
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:35.340]   sport edition and not only that, but also increase the price by maybe 50 or 100 bucks.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:40.780]   And then next year they have, I can so easily picture that keynote in my mind in which they
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.900]   talk about how many millions and millions they've sold of these and it's the most popular
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.820]   watch ever sold and it's a really incredible product category and look at all the apps
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:54.900]   have been written for it, but we found that people are even wearing their $350, $450 sport
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.700]   watch with $10,000 suits because they like it, they consider it jewelry.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.940]   So we decided to start making cases that are just like jewelry.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.340]   So we're here to introduce Apple Watch edition applause, applause, applause, applause, applause.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.300]   It's just, it's such a distraction.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.700]   Again, smart watch is like the very first iPad.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:17.580]   It is so hard to explain to someone who has never used one exactly why they might want
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.740]   to have one.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:23.500]   And so it just seems like it might be a hindrance to the message that they have to get out for
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.700]   the sport watch.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.420]   Yeah, the price point became the story instead of the product.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.660]   And people shouldn't be blamed for it.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.540]   I was a little bit, I was a little bit bummed out when John Gruber and a couple others were
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.980]   saying, oh, let's let's take bets on how the press is going to freak out over the price.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.860]   Well, it's a $17,000 gadget.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.740]   No one should freak out about it, but it's definitely worthy of at least discussion of
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.140]   the first time a big company, not like this little boutique has decided to actually decide
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.060]   where you actually unabashedly going to create a really high end object.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.060]   That in itself is a new story.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.380]   No one should freak out about it and no one should.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.420]   I that D word.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.820]   I hate that there were only a half a dozen words that I absolutely hate.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:06.700]   And if you use it without being sarcastic or ironic, I have to start thinking that maybe
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.700]   you're an idiot.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.900]   And that D word is that D word is one of them.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.460]   That's the same reason why I thought that people who are like, you know, you've never
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.220]   used Google Glass, you've never met anybody who's used Google Glass, but you're willing
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.380]   to call someone who has a Google Glass and a whole.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.820]   Okay, you're an idiot.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:26.180]   So but but it's but that doesn't mean that the idea of a $10,000 watch for the plastic
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.300]   band is not a interesting topic of discussion.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.540]   I think you can make the argument that somebody uses a Google Glass and his video videoing
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:37.660]   things as they walk around as a jerk without trying to kill by me or cat at the show.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.660]   You know, there were two your cats.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.660]   Another problem.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660]   The mere combination of a table.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.220]   I almost got started on the me or cat.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   I know.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.180]   But to Andy's point, I mean, there are people at Apple who drive 10 year old cameras and
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:48.300]   people at Apple who have multiple supercars.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.140]   It's a it's a diverse group.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.940]   And this is a not like a smartphone was just emerging technology.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:57.500]   Apple was taking the phone and and and you're trying to there were a lot of smartphones,
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.940]   but they were trying to mainstream the smartphone watches are already mainstream.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.300]   It's it's something that it's a very different sort of like I'm not trying to say like it's
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.620]   a good decision or bad decision, but I can understand why someone would say we're going
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.180]   to roll out this watch and we want to we definitely need to think about the athletes.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.340]   We're going to make a sport version.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.700]   We definitely need to think about people who are into, you know, I forget what they call
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:21.500]   them, Corona, a horror, horology, we have to make the high end version and I could see
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.020]   that discussion taking I don't think the high end versions for that.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.180]   I think the chat rooms got it right.
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:29.140]   It's for it's for Nuvo reach people in China.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.900]   It's for people who are status focused.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.980]   It's for people who, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't label and I wouldn't guess it's
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:39.380]   for is for people who see who who feel as though that's a good use of their money and
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:45.940]   I'm I look around me and I even have only have to go into like a good use of your money.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.300]   Again, I don't I'm not going to tell somebody that if somebody who has that kind of income
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.820]   that they if they simply like it, they don't have to justify to me or anybody else.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.980]   Oh, for sure.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:16:00.140]   Well, yeah, which is also in my mind, a patently a bad use of your money, but it's it's a free
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140]   world.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.140]   It's a free country.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.260]   They used to say you could do it.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.340]   I don't I don't I don't want to be dishonest here about my own feelings.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:11.780]   I will tell you that I do feel as though the gold that watches absolutely silly.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:16.380]   But again, I I look through my own inbox of receipts of things I bought on eBay and paid
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.260]   way too much because because because because I because I and because I mean here hearing
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:26.460]   on one second, you know, it's not already told you she had both both the golds on it.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.340]   The show and she was she liked it.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.700]   She was truly I tried it too.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.660]   And it's it's hard not to like really it's so beautiful face on it.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:36.860]   And it's just, you know, it is though unusual and especially the tech sector where you pay
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.340]   a lot more for something you don't get more memory or a faster processor, some technical
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:45.460]   benefit all you're getting is appearance benefit.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.420]   I mean, something we're not used to.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.420]   That's all.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.460]   Again, we don't and there and there are reasons why I just this happening nearby.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.180]   This is my R2D to cookie jar.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.180]   We love him.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.940]   Years ago on eBay and it's not like it cost a fortune, but it costs more money than I
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:59.940]   should have bought.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.940]   It cost $17,000.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.220]   I would have to get I would have to.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.900]   But but again, imagine that someone has a level of income above $17,000 that my income
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:14.980]   was at that time above the 80 or 90 or 100 bucks I spent for this all those years ago.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:19.940]   I would not want to have to explain to somebody why again, as a little kid, I saw this in
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   catalogs.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.780]   Oh my God, that's the coolest thing ever.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.780]   And of course, I'm a little kid.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.300]   So I can't afford to get it now.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.300]   I can get it.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   And it's on a shelf.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.460]   I enjoy it a lot.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.900]   I didn't just simply look at it for three weeks, then throw it away.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:36.140]   This is things like this is the reason why that again, I personally think the gold watches
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.900]   and a dumb product, but I'm not going to judge somebody else for a that's.
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.620]   See that R2 don't let people say that you're a stupid product.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:49.020]   Mark, what's your thought on all of this?
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.060]   I agree with Renee's initial point on the watch.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.020]   It exists for whoever wants it.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.540]   No one's forcing you to buy it.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.900]   There's no reason to call someone out for buying it, just like people calling out people
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.100]   for in Google Glass.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.900]   I mean, it doesn't look as ridiculous as Google Glass.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.660]   I feel like if you see someone wearing one outside, it won't be that easy to tell it apart
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:15.300]   from the other models, just because of how things shine in the sun.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:19.940]   I think even the gold phone looks like the silver phone.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:22.020]   So I really don't think it's a big deal.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:27.300]   It's more of a statement, a status symbol type of thing.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:32.900]   Apple really is shooting for comprehensive product launches, as we see with this upcoming
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.140]   Apple TV.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.060]   So I think it made sense from that perspective and from the perspective to get it into vogue
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:44.540]   and for marketing-wise and to drag people into retail stores, to launch all three collections,
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.540]   as they call it.
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:49.020]   I think the gold watch is going to be a huge driver to retail stores.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:54.020]   People will want to come play with the gold Apple watch, and they'll settle for the ones
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.780]   that Apple knows that they're trying to sell in the first place.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:03.260]   I mean, Apple, in terms of their guidance or internal metrics and whatnot, I mean, I
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.540]   don't even know what percentage, like what fraction of 1% of gold watches they're expecting
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.940]   to sell out of the whole portfolio.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.220]   I don't think they even care if they sell one.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.180]   It's a driver marketing-wise.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.780]   It's a driver getting people into stores-wise.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:22.300]   It's a driver conversation-wise, and all conversation is good for Apple in this product.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.580]   It's hardware space.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.380]   So I think it's a good thing for the company.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.260]   With that said, I'm not going to buy one, obviously.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:33.340]   I strongly believe, and a lot of people have pushed back on this, but I strongly believe
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:39.860]   that buying a gold Apple watch for $15,000, $10,000, $17,000, that will stop working
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:44.380]   in two, three, four years is a foolish thing from a technology perspective for a few years.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   Yeah, and that's all we can talk about is technology.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.860]   We're not fashion reporters.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.740]   We're not hote-coachure experts, but from a technology point of view.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.740]   I do like that Apple, for a long time we heard that Apple's not innovating, and Apple's
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.740]   boring.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   What else can Apple do?
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740]   They're doing the same thing all the way.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:03.420]   We'll complain if they do things, we'll complain if they don't.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.340]   Maybe there'll be a second generation gold watch, third, fourth, maybe there won't.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.340]   They're trying things.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.340]   It's interesting.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:12.460]   We'll agree, we'll disagree, we'll discuss it, but it's interesting.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.460]   You got it.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:19.980]   However you feel about it, you have to read that amazing article about the manufacture
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:27.100]   of the watch put together by a Portland product designer who apparently has a lot of experience
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:34.500]   in the manufacturers called How Apple Makes the Watch from the Atomic Delights blog, which
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:38.500]   is written by a fellow named Greg Kerning.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.620]   I thought this made me want the gold watch.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.620]   Really interesting.
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:52.700]   Apple clearly showing its prowess at industrial design, obviously they have prowess of design,
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.260]   but at production.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:58.020]   At scale, he said he could make every part of that watch once, but to be hundreds of
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.060]   them a minute is just insane.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:06.420]   He starts off by saying Apple shipped a Boeing 787's weight worth of iPhones every 24 hours
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.620]   last quarter.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:14.420]   Only a company that can make 75 million iPhones, 25 million iPhones a month, has the production
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.540]   prowess to make something like this.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:26.220]   The choices that they made are really interesting.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.900]   The alloys that they're using, some are common.
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:33.100]   The steel watch is a common, probably the most popular form of stainless steel, sometimes
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.780]   called incorrectly surgical grade stainless steel.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.580]   The way they use ultrasonic testing to make sure that there are not imperfections in the
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.220]   gold body of the watch.
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.300]   The way they polish it.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.300]   The way they manufacture it.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:52.540]   I think the digital crown is really interesting.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:57.020]   He says precise grippy serrations.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.100]   How they do them after the polishing, because they don't want the polishing to polish down
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.100]   the serrations.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.820]   It's all very interesting.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.060]   It's based on his knowledge of manufacturing as he applied them to the videos.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.140]   He says he's not sure he's 100% right, but he's highly knowledgeable in this and this
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.580]   is his best guess is.
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.740]   Yeah, that's what's great about this.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.860]   He's basically deconstructing very short videos.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.500]   And one frame is enough to inform, I see what they're doing here.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.660]   Let's set the section on aluminum.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:25.900]   Even if you're not interested in the watch, it's a fascinating look into manufacturing
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.900]   processes.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:33.260]   He's talking about oxidation on aluminum, that how rust on steel is a bad thing, but
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:38.580]   oxidation on metal is actually kind of like a metal enamel on top of everything else that
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.420]   for a short brief amount of time, it's like a honeycomb lattice of oxidation that you can
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.780]   then put colors into.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.100]   I'm saying color you want.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.100]   It's really cool stuff.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.820]   That's the an an an an an anization process.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:54.300]   It's it's interesting to compare this though to like other like high end luxury watch and
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.780]   other product videos where you see the watch of for these like half million dollar watches
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:04.380]   where it's like 45 minutes of just tiny little tweezers with human hands carefully putting
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.940]   tiny things into place.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.900]   And then there's the Leica video for was the M1 or something where they show it's just
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:14.940]   42 minutes of like human hands and white gloves carefully like shake carefully like sanding
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:20.540]   like a part like shook shook shook shook shook shook shook shook careful look.
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:24.940]   And in contrast to both these apples saying no we use computers and machines because they're
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.380]   real good at this stuff.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.140]   And we're and we have to make a thousand a minute.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   Exactly.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.460]   Yeah, even the aluminum, you know, if you're feeling bad that you have to buy the 350
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.220]   dollar watch, probably what I'll end up buying.
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.860]   Even the aluminum is an amazing process involved in this.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:41.860]   How much of those machines getting paid though?
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.060]   Are they being paid a fair way?
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.420]   I think the slave labor.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.980]   I really do.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:50.020]   So just just have to recommend that atomic delights.com and I've recommended on a few
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.940]   other shows but you got it.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   You got to read it.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.540]   And even if you have no interest in the watch what's a little absolute.
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.540]   Great piece.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.140]   But it is it does tell you a lot about Apple and about Apple's abilities and about how
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.180]   Apple is a unique company and so forth.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.500]   And their priorities and their priorities.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.140]   They are polishing and buffing stuff you will never see.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:15.540]   Their laser cutting the insides so it's smooth even though you will never see that.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.740]   That's that's that's Johnny I've.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.820]   Okay.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.820]   Or crazy.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:20.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:21.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:24.060]   We're making conclusions based on facts, not in evidence.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.340]   There might be some part there must there might be some part of like reclaiming stuff they
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:28.340]   don't need.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:29.340]   That's that's positive thing.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   We don't.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.940]   I wouldn't put it past Apple to say let's put this extra step just to make the insides
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   look good.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:39.140]   But yeah, we've seen them done that do that before with the inside of that computer is
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   green.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.140]   What are they thinking?
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.140]   We've seen but we've seen them do that with the Max.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:50.940]   You know do stuff that nobody sees that makes it nicer for aesthetically one week from today
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:55.660]   Apple the new book about your we're just going to have an onslaught of books about Steve
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.660]   Jobs for the rest of our lives.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:58.420]   You might as well get used to it.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.500]   Some better some worse.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:09.740]   The new one's becoming Steve Jobs and you can read us pretty big excerpt on fast company.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.820]   But I think we'll all be kind of getting up early next Tuesday to download and read this
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.740]   book before Mac break weekly.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.740]   You have an assignment children.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.340]   It's only when he's told that picture in that article just a second ago only then did
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:26.140]   I realize that Tim Cook is having a sort of an Obama sort of thing going on with his
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.980]   hair where he used to have like this dark hair but as soon as he had to lead the company.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.980]   It's great.
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   That's great.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.340]   That's what the classic color is here.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.820]   So among other stories I'm sure you've heard the one about Tim Cook offering part of his
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.860]   liver to Steve and Steve saying no.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.460]   Cook says one of the five times jobs ever yelled at me.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:51.140]   He also and this was interesting said the Isaacson book did Steve Jobs a disservice.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:55.340]   There's a lot of many reviewers said at the time.
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.780]   I mean it's all we had.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:59.900]   I mean those were the interviews Steve gave.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.340]   I just think that they the general feeling was that he didn't ask the sort of questions
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.540]   that Apple the people who interested in Apple would have asked.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.060]   But Cook did say the person I read about an Isaacson's book is somebody I would never
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.780]   have wanted to work with over all this time.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:20.020]   And there's a new movie that came out at South by Southwest which also kind of has that
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:25.100]   subtext of what an a hole what a D word.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.100]   I don't know.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.660]   I mean the the clips that have emerged from South by Southwest don't basically show yes.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.340]   Now that he's been gone for a few years I can be very honest and say that it was a very
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.420]   very difficult working relationship to have but I still maintain enormous amount of respect
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.180]   and fondness for the time that I spent there.
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.980]   He's that clip with Bob Belville where he cries.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   Exactly.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.260]   And he says it's the worst thing I ever happened to me and I you know I hated every moment of
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:49.020]   it and I do it again in a heartbeat.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:55.980]   It's hard to find people who are saying that the times when dealing when working with Steve
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:27:00.300]   Jobs was unpleasant it's because he was arbitrarily unpleasant and it wasn't because he was taking
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.580]   something out on me that he should have taken on somebody else or that had nothing to do
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.980]   with the project we're working on really the thing the thing that you respect is that
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.900]   it's always about here's the results that we want to get for the company and here's why
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.340]   I'm unhappy with the results that you're giving me right now.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.020]   Which is not to say that I would have lasted more than eight seconds working in that capacity
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:22.100]   but that's still it's different from having these bosses who are just like this croissant
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.940]   is stale and therefore I'm canceling your project.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.140]   Omega beams Andy.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140]   Omega beams.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.980]   I never had to work with Steve Jobs.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:35.900]   I spent one week one week one week end with him 20 years ago and it's hard not to admire
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:42.740]   the man's intelligence and not to notice his his he's in he was in a hurry he was brusque
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.580]   he didn't tolerate fools lightly arrogance might be a word to describe it but here's
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:51.220]   something that I think very important and this is a quote from becoming Steve Jobs the
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:57.540]   belief in apple as a special place as a company as magical perhaps as an iPad was something
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:01.660]   Steve shared with cook and was certainly part of the reason he urged the board of directors
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:06.540]   to sign off on cook as his successor there was a significant common thread we had says
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:11.780]   cook I really love apple and I do think apple is here for a bigger reason there are very
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.620]   few companies like that on the face of the earth anymore and that's an interesting cultural
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:21.660]   thing that I think is absolutely true and he is apple fans probably feel something of
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:26.700]   the same thing I know early on in apples you know somebody who used every you know CPM
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:37.540]   computers and and MS DOS and early PCs apple was clearly hewing to a different path and
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:43.620]   was trying to do something transformative instead of just a business and I don't I think
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:48.300]   that's culturally very significant important to apple it's why we get research kid and
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:51.460]   why we have shareholder meetings when they ask him what the business model for research
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:58.820]   kid is we get fiery Tim Cook for a few seconds yeah he says he says eight weeks after Steve
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:04.940]   told cookie was making him see a CEO things his health took a sudden turn for the worse
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:09.380]   I watched a movie with him the Friday before he passed away cook remembers we watched remember
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:14.940]   the Titans which is it that'll make you cry if you watch that movie it's a football story
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:20.620]   about an underdog high school team I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie I
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.900]   was like are you sure remember Tim Cook college football fanatic Steve Jobs not so much Steve
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:31.140]   was not interested in sports at all cooks as and we watched and we talked about a number
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.860]   of things and I left thinking he was pretty happy and all of a sudden things went to hell
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:40.620]   that weekend I will read this book and I will watch I'm very interested in this by this
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:47.100]   a new documentary about him which is huge seems alike say again it was not the one that
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:53.180]   he cute didn't like well I think a lot of people won't like it because it if I don't
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:58.140]   know like you get the feeling that again I haven't seen it only people at South by I've
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:02.580]   seen it so far and I will be very anxious to see it but you get the yeah he had a cue
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:10.700]   call it a mean spirited and an accurate portrayal but the the the documentarian starts off with
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:15.660]   Steve's death and showing how people and he includes himself went to the Apple store
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:20.780]   where they were just drawn to the Apple store that day to kind of remember Steve and to
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:27.900]   in a way thank him and then the movie apparently goes on to portray a much more complex individual
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:33.260]   and and the question really apparently again I haven't seen it just read the reviews that
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:41.860]   is raised by this biographies why did people revere this man when he was such a dick basically
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:46.940]   I think in a nutshell I don't like use that term the D word that's another D word you
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:51.380]   know no no I mean that that's different I mean I I've referred to the winter weather as a
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:58.100]   dick that is and I definitely met it it's just hard to you though the more we learn about
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.940]   the how he let us life and how he ran Apple the more the more you appreciate that it's
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:05.860]   really hard to encapsulate his experience very hard he was very complex and any and
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.740]   anyone sent it absolutely true but I think the one thing that is true is he he did not
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:18.740]   he almost knew he did not have time to waste unpleasantries although I'll tell you he
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:24.380]   could be very socially very graceful and kind and Tim and I think Tim has that sensation
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:29.420]   of Tim Cook says Steve Jobs was a very kind and generous man and he wouldn't take my
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:40.380]   liver even with a bottle of Keatie in a plate of fava beans I'm sorry I made that joke should

[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:43.300]   process because oh really because I mean we cook all the time actually at home so what
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:48.460]   this did was kind of take a layer out of the whole process right instead of us having
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:53.220]   to kind of coordinate what recipes we're gonna do right and then figure out what what you
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:57.100]   know items we need to fulfill those recipes and everything they do all that stuff and
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.900]   then pretty much you just have it all laid out for fun isn't it okay put it all together

[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:19.380]   picks of the week and Iinaco would you kick things off for us two picks that have been
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:23.060]   around for a while and people might have even heard of but these are personal recommendations
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:28.220]   for a couple of different reasons people are doing a lot of keyboard reviews and I've been
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:33.300]   carrying around the Microsoft universal mobile keyboard this does not fold like others that
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.220]   I've used but what I love and why this is my now my favorite travel keyboard if you can't
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:42.180]   afford to carry like the full-size apple wireless is that look how well it's designed it's like
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:48.660]   one nice hard package like this when you open this up though you have a full size excuse
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.100]   me a mobile sized keyboard but still very type of what I wrote about two thousand words
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.180]   on an Amtrak trained in New York on this last week but you have a built-in laptops built-in
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:03.420]   tablet stand that is big enough to pretty much hold almost anything securely so it really
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.540]   works extremely well on top of everything and you can also pull that off if you actually
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:14.300]   want to in theory you're a keyboard fanatic aren't you well I I write for a living and
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.060]   I like to write in places that are not necessarily inside my house right so I'm very aware of
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.740]   these things the other cool thing is that's a bluetooth keyboard but it's a triple triple
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:26.140]   stack keyboard so you can actually pair it with a bluetooth with three different devices
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:29.420]   and just choose what device you're using it with so if you have like you can use it with
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.860]   your phone and then click the the switch in other position and use it with your tablet
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:37.220]   and click it in another position and just use it as a detached keyboard for for presentations
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:42.780]   and stuff like that 69 bucks and again I just like something that's really nice and compact
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:46.660]   and can be tossed it is not uncomfortable to work with for a long periods of time the
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:53.460]   second thing is actually the iPad mini 3 which I just bought for myself just this really
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:58.940]   and I think that it's it's an interesting story and I'll try to make it brief but I had
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:04.380]   budgeted money about five or six or seven hundred dollars to buy a iPhone 6 or a Nexus
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:08.660]   6 some some kind of a large like six inch phone because I figured that I had a real
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:13.700]   use case for a phone that could be used for just little off-site writing tools like when
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:18.340]   I have like about an hour free or two hours free and for a couple of reasons I didn't
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:23.740]   decide that I wanted to switch back to the iPhone 6 and I also decided that the Nexus
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:28.740]   6 was not the one I wanted so I was kind of held off held off held off and oddly enough
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:32.620]   the experience of using an eight inch tablet on the eight inch windows tablet the cost
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:38.060]   60 bucks on that on that train made me realize that the actual perfect use case I have is
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:44.180]   not for a large phone but for a small tablet so because me there's a this is like my little
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:49.340]   like sort of day purse and I need something that's small enough to fit inside this and
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:53.860]   still have room for for my camera and my water bottle and other things I'm gonna be spending
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:59.700]   like for a day in New York to have just like one meeting and come back for it's it's a
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:04.860]   large enough size that's eminently useful because it's iOS as opposed to an Android tablet you
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.780]   have real world class productivity apps for it whereas Android has great phone apps but
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:15.780]   almost still almost next to nothing in terms of really serious hardcore productivity apps
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.900]   and it's it's an iPad nothing else is an iPad the other interesting thing is that as has
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:26.220]   been proven time and time again there is the only real difference between an iPad three
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:32.980]   iPad mini three and an iPad air two is the size and the price and if you really don't
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:36.660]   mind having a smaller screen you'll get pretty much the same CPU the same speed the same
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:43.180]   experience it has touch ID that my previous iPad was an iPad three the one that's sort
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:48.460]   of been orphaned a little bit by a lot of features and a lot by a lot of its hardware limitations
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:53.580]   I am holding out for the big purchase of an iPad pro if and when it gets released later
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:57.940]   on this year and I just realized that while I can actually make even even if and when that
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.060]   comes out and if and when I buy it I will still have a use for a compact tablet that
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:06.060]   can fit inside something tiny and doesn't have to make the make a make an excuse for
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:11.500]   itself I bought the 64 gig version of the 128 version because I do like to have lots
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.700]   of comics and lots of movies and lots of files on there and I don't have I don't want to
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.620]   have to choose on what need what I need to delete to make room for something else I did
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:24.540]   not get the GPS version or the the LTE version because in the years since I bought my iPad
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:30.540]   three it's so easy to simply activate a hotspot even on my on Android simply like flick a
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:34.540]   button on my watch and suddenly the hotspot feature on my phone is activated that it wasn't
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:40.220]   as big a deal as anything else so I was surprised to find out as soon as this idea occurred to
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:44.140]   me that well gee you for years you have not been interested in the iPad mini for yourself
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.220]   because you feel so you really need the big screen experience of the full-sized iPad you
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:51.580]   have just demonstrated to yourself by the fact by the virtue of the fact you were almost willing
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:57.740]   to use a six inch screen for actual work that argument is no longer valid so I think that if
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:02.220]   you're looking for something that was is a good gap computer something that's only that's only
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:06.060]   going to help you out for about two or three hours spade of work that you're going to have during a
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:10.860]   day out of the office it's a really it's a good value it's a good choice you can buy cheaper
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:14.540]   tablets but none that will fulfill that role I think as well as an iPad mini three
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:20.220]   wow because it's very similar and I presume that they're going to do a bigger update this fall
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:26.620]   it's very similar to last year's iPad mini it's a major CPU upgrade and plus touch ID that makes
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:33.660]   it and yeah and and you and as with the as with the iPhones as with the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:39.020]   you don't really notice what a big advantage touch ID is until you don't have it and then now you do
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:43.020]   have it I hate it and again I have an old iPad I still have to enter my password it's really
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:48.620]   frustrating yeah but that's that's that's again one of those tiny little convenience features that
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:52.780]   you're not frustrated that you have to type in a password just like I'm not frustrated that I used
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:57.820]   to be have to like pull up my phone to like actually activate hotspot it's only when you suddenly
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.740]   don't have to do that anymore that you realize how much you're glad that you don't have to do that
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.180]   anymore so it does have a CPU upgrade I thought that they didn't upgrade but yeah no benchmarks I
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:13.180]   when I wrote my original piece on the two back in the fall I again it's sometimes you have to like
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:17.740]   I have to like challenge and re-challenge my conclusions because they make no sense and I know
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:23.020]   that I can be stupid and make mistakes and it's like no I'm basically seeing that anything I want
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:29.980]   to do on the iPad mini I can do just as fast as I can do it on the iPad Air 2 so but which is not
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.620]   to say that a larger screen doesn't have benefits I would much rather spend an afternoon writing on
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:41.180]   a screen that's larger than than eight inches but given that my use case for this is not to have
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:46.300]   a big convenient screen to work on but simply to have something that can handle the four food
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.740]   groups of my workday when I'm getting on a train for three three four hours to New York or just need
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:55.740]   just get a little bit of work done in a column while I'm boogying out of the office or on my way
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:01.500]   to someplace else it's very much the best choice that was available to me thank you Andy and I'm
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:09.340]   co mr. Renee Richie you got a pick for us I do I have to couch it by saying that I thought it
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:14.140]   would be available by now it's going to be available shortly hopefully today maybe tomorrow but it's
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:20.060]   an app by Tomalt called hype three it's the latest generation app version of their
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:26.620]   the best way to describe it is flash without flash it's an html five animation you know almost
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:31.020]   like classic timeline animation tool you can make almost anything with it that you could make in
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:37.740]   flash but instead of a proprietary format it does everything in html five it's just a fantastic
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:43.980]   app it's made by an amazing team formal app former apple engineers are behind it and they've got an
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:48.700]   interesting new model with this they have the app itself it's free to try it's 50 dollars to buy
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:54.940]   it and then if you want professional the version it's a 50 dollar in-app purchase so professional
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:59.020]   gives you things like physics based animation for example and serenity cauldwell is going to have
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:03.820]   a full review of it as soon as it's live but she did like a quick video game in just a few minutes
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:09.100]   what if you know it's but she in a short amount of time she managed to do a very basic video game
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:13.020]   and for anybody who wants web animation but wants web animation that's compatible everywhere
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:17.740]   that's portable everywhere that just looks great and they let you know try it out on different
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:24.300]   screens so you can test it it's amazing it is it I started using it a couple years ago and I never
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:28.860]   I never looked back because my background in flash was classic timeline animation it wasn't any of
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:34.620]   the later interface sort of stuff and I just I love it they do a fantastic job it's super clean
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.740]   it's super quick it's lightweight if you want to make banners if you want to make games if you
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:44.860]   want to make anything that you would have used flash for before hype just in my opinion does it
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:50.380]   better and cleaner and with standards compliant code and I can't say enough great things about
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:57.420]   it I think hype 3 is an utterly fantastic update and I think high professionals finry called it
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.300]   almost like going from my movie to final cup pro and I think that's very apt because it is sort
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:07.260]   of a next sort of professional level tools and everything I'm saying now is on their websites I'm
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:12.940]   not spoiling it by you know giving you the information early but it's soon it's uh yeah Jonathan Deutsch
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:18.060]   is the main driver behind the company and just really really good stuff from really really good
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:25.180]   people are you supposed to shake Guinness before you open it I'm just wondering are you supposed
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:29.900]   to shake it and then stab the whole thing in it right like the little paintball well you should
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:34.380]   definitely shake it more but especially if there's gonna be video running when you open it I shake
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:39.580]   it for another good 10 seconds it's to warn worn mark to duck what mark german did you
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:45.020]   did you bring anything along as a pick did you because if you didn't it's okay nothing today all
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:50.940]   right I brought obviously I brought my st. Patrick's day Irish potato chips we're gonna get a pair
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.580]   of those glasses oh aren't they awesome st. Patrick's day I hope you're wearing greener I'm
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:47:02.220]   gonna have to come there and pinch you nothing mark mark you've already pinched us all with your
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:08.780]   intellect Leo that's right so I just want to mention a couple of great games if you're a retro game
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:15.340]   person have come to the Macintosh finally I love command and conquer there it's a category uh
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:19.500]   that I wish we see more of these top-down real-time strategy games like Age of Empires
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.420]   a lot of people a Starcraft a lot of people think command and conquer was the best in the category
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:28.860]   it is now out in a port for the Macintosh a little pricey $20 but that's still a lot less than you paid
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:36.860]   when you bought it back and when was it 19 maybe in 20 something and then the other one I really love
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:42.060]   is and has been now slowly ported to a lot of things just came out on the PlayStation I think
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:48.700]   Abe's Odd World Strangers Wrath what a heck of a good game this was this is only $10
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:53.020]   and a really nice port as well I'm not gonna I didn't download it on this machine because I
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:58.860]   don't have enough room both of these are fairly hefty 692 megabytes for strangers wrath but boy a
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:04.380]   great game so if you're in the mood for some retro gaming action to go along with your Guinness harp
