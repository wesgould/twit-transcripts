[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.860]   The fabulous I'm more calm great to see Renee welcome morning. Well. Thank you so much. Good morning
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.480]   Yeah, Alex Lindsay is on the way
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.400]   He'll join us in a moment
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   He's on the on the road from the airport in a and the in our co is also here could see you
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.920]   Enter always good to see you Leo always good to see you Renee and always good to see an empty chair that will soon be filled by Alex
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.120]   Or Elijah we don't know yet somebody
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.640]   Sad to say it won't be filled by Robin Williams, of course terrible terrible news yesterday and
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   I think we're all still reeling
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.640]   You know Robin was a geek. I remember seeing him several times at Mac world expose
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   Problem is he couldn't really go to Mac world Expo and enjoy it because he'd be hounded all through the hall
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.280]   But it's just such a terrible
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.840]   loss and when I think we feel a little keep even more keenly here in the Bay Area because
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.280]   He was somebody who just was everywhere in the Bay Area. I'm very happily lived very happily here
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   I
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480]   Don't know if you guys want to say anything about it, but I also
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   ditching it also the he comes from an era where
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.080]   Remember like in the 90s and the late 80s when Apple fans felt besieged and that maybe Apple's not gonna be around for three or four or five years
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.240]   So when you find out that someone who you really like who is really really cool is also one of those rare people who uses a Mac
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   It's like oh, he's one of us
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.920]   I could I could he could stay in my guest room because I feel as though we're already friends and know each other very very well
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   And of course his maybe his very last
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.680]   professional work was
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   doing an ad for the iPad air
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:41.600]   Don't read in right poetry because it's cute
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.200]   We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race and the human race is filled with passion
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.720]   Medicine law business engineering these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.360]   But poetry beauty
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.120]   Romance love
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.000]   He's what we stay alive for
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.500]   Quoping Whitman owe me a life of the questions of these recurring
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.800]   Of the endless trains of the faithless of cities filled with the foolish
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.600]   But good admit these owe me a life
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.880]   Answer that you are here that life exists and identity
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.320]   That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:52.440]   The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.120]   What will your verse be hmm?
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.960]   You know it's um we kind of made fun of that ad because it was well frankly so
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.560]   intellectual and
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.280]   Seemed well, so heavy and much the more heavy now
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.200]   And you listen to those words and him saying those and wow
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.160]   Yeah, it's interesting. There's a the bench that
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.000]   That his character and Matt Damon's character sat on at the public garden during a will the
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   Good will hunting has been known as the good will hunting bench sort of unofficially the snow plaque on it
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.640]   And now that's turn into sort of a makeshift shrine here
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.840]   Yeah, cuz not it's not it's not just the it's because I think it's because of stuff like that
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   Some of the lofty work he did that made a lot of people connect to him in that way
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   You know of course the monologue is from good will I'm sorry dead poet society beautiful beautiful monologue and
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   At reading some of the coverage I got the impression that that was re-recorded
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.120]   Does it did anybody sit down and compare it to the actual monologue in the movie?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.000]   Because I think he re-recorded that recently
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   No, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, the audio the audio seems a little
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.320]   1990s, that's why I assumed they just lifted it from the movie
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   But but then I'm reading coverage and it says he recorded it, so I'm not sure I don't believe what people have people have to push out
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.120]   Yeah, I really feel I don't know I wouldn't say contempt actually
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.240]   I think I should see feel more sympathy for people who are working for a certain sites where they themselves are sad when one of their favorite
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.600]   Entertainment tanners dies, but now that they know that okay is now my responsibility here at 1 a.m.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.800]   To come up with things to post online on the site tomorrow that will get clicks for all the people who are gonna start searching for stuff about
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.920]   Robin Williams. Yeah, so that's I feel a little bit sorry. It's so creepy isn't it so sad?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.480]   Well, it's it's their job and I don't like to judge because I'm sure that when they signed up for they didn't say oh
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.200]   That's some point I'm going I'm going to whip up a mail storm of bad of sad feelings about things that we could then turn into
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   Ad clicks. Yeah, but it's oh well
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   Anyway, it's hard to hard to do anything but just I and
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.480]   It a tragic tragic end to one of the greatest
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.760]   So
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   Lots of news about a Mac
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.400]   But one of the things that kind of intrigued me not we might start off with something a little bit more speculative you
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:33.360]   Actually, Renee Richie talked about it on i'more.com regarding arm based Macs
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:43.600]   One of the things that happened Jellowy Gasey on Monday wrote a piece in which he actually is quoting us mostly quoting somebody else
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   a young guy when he wrote the
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.240]   Original piece of 2011 three years ago. He was 16 Matt Richmond in his blog post apple and arm sitting in a tree
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.520]   So this was three years ago, but now with the release of the new
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.960]   K1 chip from Nvidia new Tegra K1
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.280]   64-bit chip that is faster than many desktop processors
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   It makes me wonder if there isn't something to this
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.440]   What do you think of all of this? I mean it's pure speculation as you point out
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.040]   It's so Apple is not a dumb company
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.840]   And if there's anything that any of us could think that Apple might be interested in chances are that they have prototype
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   That they have it in testing they have it in development
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   We know they had the marklar the Intel based Macs running for a long time before they switch to Intel running in the labs
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.720]   We know that Apple has had interns porting things like OS 10 to aren't they always 10 kernel to arm
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.800]   The rumor has it they have arm based Macs. I'm running iOS
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.960]   I'm with touch screens all of that in the lab, but that's a far cry from a shipping product
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.000]   The switch to Intel happened because they could get better power efficiency
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.720]   And it was a whole bunch of advantages that came to switching to Intel including PC compatibility. They could run
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   Bootcamp they could run emulators switching to
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.200]   Arm I think a lot of people a lot of lay observers are excited because the idea of Apple owning the whole stack where they see the a7
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.400]   chip and how powerful it is and they start to dream of of
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.840]   Arm based Macs, but
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.760]   For Apple to do this they would have to have as compelling a reason would have to be as beneficial to them to undergo the pain of the
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.400]   Transfer of having to figure out are they gonna run iOS will they get OS 10 on to an arm chip?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.840]   Would everyone who makes OS 10 apps have to port them to an arm chip?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   Would they emulate existing x86 apps?
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.600]   How would they handle windows people still need when the windows and enterprise would there be a boot camp?
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.200]   There are so many questions and so much pain involved that I think this stuff is
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.800]   Absolutely in the realm of speculation and maybe a little bit of fan fiction at the moment. Yeah
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.880]   Yeah, only other you see some benefits, but you have you're right to underscore the trials that would go along Apple did
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.320]   It's so well with Intel that maybe people forget that
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:00.040]   I mean Rosetta and carbon were done so beautifully that I think a lot of people didn't feel much pain making the transition development
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.320]   I mean they have those and also have those things
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's just a question of those becoming shipping products
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.880]   Yeah, and the decision to make those shipping products Apple when Apple says things like people don't like touch-screen max aren't a good idea
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.600]   They're not ergonomic
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.920]   It's not because they're pulling out of their hat
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.600]   It's because they made touch-screen max and they tested them significantly and that was determination and as far as I know the arm max
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.840]   They dangle those over Intel and say how late is broadwell gonna be again?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.360]   And it's really effective for that
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   But it's probably not effective for stuffing store shelves yet and as Renee says
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.800]   I mean when they did the transition to Intel you forget that power PC was not dead
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.400]   But oh boy the trajectory of that CPU was going way way down Apple was really it was but as I recall Apple was the only main
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.760]   Main client for that CPU that wasn't like embedded systems and controller systems
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.600]   We're asked if they switch to Intel so long as as Microsoft Windows continues to run at Intel machines
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:01.160]   Intel was going to continue to make hot hot hot processors next generation generation after that generation after that
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.040]   So there was nothing but upside to switch to Intel given that given that the the hassles to developers is not something that Apple
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.440]   Is gonna care about 19 in the back then so if they were to switch to arm it would have to be something so compelling
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.760]   Such as their ability to really tailor make a CPU to a specific model which they could do it
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.920]   I mean that's they could do it
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.280]   I mean if one thing that would be possible if they were to adopt this is to simply say that from now on the
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:33.480]   The CPU the official CPU of the MacBook Air is going to be armed the official CPU of the MacBook Pro and the desktop line is going to be Intel
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.520]   Because if people do want that higher performance of people do want compatibility with Windows
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.120]   It's there but for the purposes of producing a thousand dollar
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.200]   But and now $900 and then in the future $800
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   Ultra-light notebook that gets not just 10 hours not just 12 hours
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.840]   But now 17 or 18 hours of battery life and could do all kinds of extra tricks that they haven't even thought of yet because they
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.400]   They can simply design an arm chip to do exactly what they needed to do for this product
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.240]   That would be an upside, but it's it's not as simple as simply you know putting a new sticker on a different box
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.200]   People might forget that it was Apple that's founded arm back in 1990
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:17.160]   Arm originally stood for a corn risk machine a corn computers, which is a popular a computer in the UK
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.240]   That was a risk processor, which stands for reduced instruction set
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   Intel processors and and all the main processors including the power PC although less so the power PC
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.760]   I guess maybe power seat might have been a resource or yeah
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.800]   We're cis complex instruction sets in other words the basic instruction set the basic fundamental capabilities of the
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.200]   Processor on Intel chips are many more base instructions
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   Instruction set is much larger than on arm. It's a reduced instruction set the idea being that you can reduce complexity and
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.760]   The chip that's one of the reasons a chip is lower power
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.720]   Is you know it's it's a simple it's a mess
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.920]   Yeah x86 because of its need to support legacy effect even Intel wanted to get away from x86
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.320]   attempted to and was
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   Pushed back because of that they needed to support legacy hardware John's Eric use
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.920]   I had a really good analysis of this and one of the things he brought into you reminded us all is that you know
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.400]   Arm is going up in performance, but Intel's going down in power. It has well is very good broad
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.320]   Well, it's gonna be very good
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.000]   But also you know Apple can design any chip they want but who's gonna fab it right now?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.040]   Intel's the only one who could fab 14 nanometer and it'd be hard for Apple to say you've got a fab our aa
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.240]   889 a10 whatever chip before you do Bradwell before you do broadwell or before you do skylake or before you do whatever is
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.960]   Next from that so
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.640]   Designing the chip is only one part of it getting it fab. There's a second part and currently that's still mostly an Intel game
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   Arm is a what they call a fabulous
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:58.080]   Company they don't make chips they design chips and license them to other people including Samsung who makes the chips currently makes the chips for the iPad and the iPhone
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.120]   Qualcomm which makes a very powerful arm chips
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.360]   Nvidia
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.400]   It's kind of interesting. They just kind of interesting question though because keep in mind that they're already fabbing
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.520]   Arm chips by the tens of millions to be to put into iOS devices, right?
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.560]   So there's certainly capacity there, but once again, it's not something that would do just to say that they would do it
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.080]   It's also if you if you if you are harping on certain negative
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.720]   Popular aspects of Apple they it's not something they would do just to simply say we don't want to be beholden to Intel anymore
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.480]   They're perfectly fine with being beholden to Intel so long as it's helping them to make the devices that they want to make
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.920]   So when they went turns out when it turns out that they can no longer make the devices they want to make and the limitation is the
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.040]   Intel that's when you start seeing a lot of serious serious velocity on these rumors. Yeah
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.120]   Yeah, I mean you do you see a performance loss, although I have to say this new K1
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.560]   Is better than the Celeron? I mean, it's not it's not up to the i3 i5 i7
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.360]   But they're they're coming on with power. It's both companies are moving in in each other's direction
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.520]   Intel very much wants to be where arm is an arm
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:07.240]   I don't know if arm wants to be where Intel is but arm certainly wants to be more powerful Apple originally founded arm and
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   supported arm
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.280]   for the newton it was in the newton I
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.000]   they divested their
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.960]   Ownership and arm quite a while ago
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.840]   And it's also it's good to point out that arm has two ways to do business with them one is to take their reference designs like a cortex a9
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.520]   Or a15 and just you know use those chips what Apple has is a master license for the arm instruction
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.520]   Set so they can the a7 chip is based on the arm reference architecture for arm
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.680]   64 so apple basically made their own chip. They didn't just use one of the reference designs
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.120]   I think that's part of what got people so excited about the idea of apple making desktop chips apple has a lot of
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.200]   In many I believe thousands of chip designers and people
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.880]   Uh responsible for chip design at in in house
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.960]   They bought didn't they buy pa risk the hba pa semi. Yeah pa semi the make you
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   They bought several and the interesting thing is
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.480]   It's not easy to find good chip designers. Finding engineers is hard finding good chip designers is really hard
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.160]   And when a lot of them left their previous companies apple was one of the companies that hired them
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.000]   And I think that's why like it's it's weird to say you know samsung makes the chips
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160]   Why isn't samsung much further ahead than apple?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.480]   Why didn't samsung go to 64 bit earlier?
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.000]   They're the ones making the chips but apple hired the brains that were designing those chips
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.640]   And I think that's what let them get you know pretty far ahead and mobile
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.960]   Yeah, yeah another thing to keep another thing to keep in mind is that arm is so it's such a popular platform because the entire
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.800]   Fundamental nature of computing has changed in the past 10 years
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.600]   Where it is a a cp that's really optimized to be a great mobile processor chip or to speak a little bit more broadly
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.640]   It's a great chip to put into a computer that is okay to have sacrifice to impose sacrifices on the user
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.200]   So if you're putting into a tablet great for putting into a phone great if you're putting it even into a chrome book
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.680]   Something where all it has to do is run of limited operating system and a web browser
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.320]   Also great, but when you really try to run
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.960]   massively multi-threaded apps
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.480]   A lot of things that have to happen absolutely synchronized to synchronize
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.160]   Perfectly to the streaming HD video and there's no excuse for dropping frame rates or anything like that
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.840]   That's when you realize what a bad that had bag of hurt
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.000]   Putting a mobile processor into it into anything with a desktop form factor is going to be
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.680]   I wonder though if there's some sort of hybrid that might not might not happen either a ipad pro
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.600]   That is
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.240]   You know verging on the macbook air territory or and we talked about this on sunday rob reed suggested what if apple
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.680]   Put arm only in the macbook air made a very low power. I mean the macbook air
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   Could have 20 hours of battery life with an arm chip in it
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.840]   Uh, it would admittedly not be as high power as a macbook pro, but that's the distinction
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.560]   Light it's it's I mean
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.320]   It's interesting. It's an interesting idea, but I I keep coming back to my idea that apple
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.960]   Already has an inexpensive low-powered very long battery life computer and it's called the ipad
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.480]   And that anytime someone says that we could we could produce a
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.120]   Much longer battery life much less powerful, but also much less expensive macbook if we change the cpu
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.800]   Apples answer would be well. Here's there. Here's the ipad air for you
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.320]   And the other problem that I would have for that is that
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.000]   If you're putting if you're trying to run the same software on two different families of cpu
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.240]   They're going to be so it seems like there's so many things that the arm processors
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.440]   Will not be able to do that would be and will require an intel and as soon as apple has to put a sticker
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.640]   Metaphorically on every page inside the inside the app store saying that this is not going to work on a macbook air
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   It's only going to work on this thing and it's because of this one api
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.120]   There's one developer wanted to use that is not necessarily
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   Important for an a list manager, but he wanted to use it or she wanted to use it and that's why i'm going to tell you that no
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.560]   You can't run this on your seven hundred and ninety dollar
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   Mac arm powered macbook air
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.520]   We make a big deal about how all the hires apple's done
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   Towards some sort of watchy kind of a thing
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:09.200]   I mean if they if people for years have been hiring chip to designers doesn't that kind of incline you to think they want to
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.000]   Do more with designing their own chips?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.360]   Well, that's that's exactly the case but it's for the ipad and the ipad
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   Well, like if you want to build an ipad you have to really have a chip that's designed for that ipad
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   If you want to have a wrist-clop machine
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:28.480]   You have to have something that's designed for that unique profile of power and and power consumption and and power projected to the user
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.720]   So you really want to have people on board who can not just simply take something off the shelf
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.280]   But simply say here is what we want the watch to do
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.680]   Please design a cp that can do that and in a in a watch that's somewhat less thin than this can't have kind of uh, seltzer
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.360]   You know, that's that's not a good solution no matter how good the screen of the cop is
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.640]   That looks like the mojo 360. It's exactly the same shape. Hey, uh, one thing we should point out
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.320]   With regard to all this and I forgot I thought and I forgot what it was
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.680]   We're talking about he'll look who's here now. I know why I'm distracted mr
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.080]   Alex Lindsey is just a joined us
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.920]   Sorry for being late. Not at all. He just leaned in here. And then plain was delayed in Vancouver Vancouver
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.600]   It's Canada's fault in Canada. Yes in Canada
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.360]   um
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.320]   Intel arm we're talking about and and whether there might be oh, I know what I wanted to point out
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:26.160]   There is one large company that is dealing with this kind of conundrum of making some intel devices and some arm devices both intended to be kind of
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.880]   Computers and that's microsoft
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   Uh, in fact, they haven't they've stopped kind of pushing their arm based rt which was the the in between
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.960]   Product although they did solve the problem of having a store that can sell to
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:45.120]   Both windows full windows and and the windows rt the metro store most of the apps in there
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.840]   Like the wasn't a successful
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   Yeah, well, that's a question
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.960]   That's a question like not to
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.200]   Not to take anything away from gasex i like a lot of his rating but writing apple should do something is easy
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.880]   What apple does with their prototypes is they ask the the repercussions the hard questions
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.920]   Like if we put arm on a macbook air does it run o s tan or does it run ios if it runs ios
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   These are the problems it runs o s tan. These are the problems are any of these better than what we're going to get by going
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.040]   With broadwell for the next macbook air because that's going to be hugely power efficient mega long battery life
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.720]   Really powerful and if the answer isn't it gives us significant advantage
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.800]   Then it just stays in the lab biting its time minding its own business until that answer changes
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   Absolutely. Would you all be shocked?
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.880]   Shocked if apple made this announcement the next year that they're they're gonna start making at least some computers with arms
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.440]   Uh, I don't know about shocked
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.880]   I I really think that the only smart reaction to possible apple products is to be ready for anything because they will leap
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.480]   They will leap out of the out of the bushes with a knife in their teeth and then god knows
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.000]   Russell to you to rest really to the ground i'm pummeled you with a new idea until you promised it to give in and buy it
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.760]   Uh, so nothing is ridiculous only because so anybody outside of apple has doesn't have the ability to see the entire picture
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   And he why why doesn't that why does an apple branded tv make absolutely no sense to me?
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.680]   Well because I don't work inside of apple. I don't know what they're planning for 2015 or 2016
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.120]   I don't know what they think that they can do that an apple tv can't so that's why i'm sort of in this position where I have to
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.080]   That that's that's why not only do I not predict stuff like that
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.320]   But also when i'm confronted with a rumor like that I have to make sure I use that weasel language saying that I don't
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.360]   Understand how that would work instead of saying oh, that's a stupid idea. And of course apple would never do it
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.440]   That's what that's what I say in that
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.480]   Many times I said apple. I'll never go until I said then everybody beats I can go on and on
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.040]   Uh, you're right yet you be smart don't predict because apple is unpredictable is our thing. We've learned there's nothing else we've learned that
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.720]   Uh, you know what this is national make a will month. We're gonna let Alex get settled and take a little bit of a break talk about

[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.560]   weekly
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.240]   I was playing chess with somebody from zimba boy the other day really yeah
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.120]   I was trying to remember all those in zimba boy and words you didn't air room or uh mcguan me
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.240]   You know, it's weird. I you know I played chess online. I was in a tournament with a russian
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.000]   Spaniard and his zimba boy and wow and I couldn't talk to any of them. It's like the highlander of chess
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   It was fun
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.280]   I beat them all by the way. I'm just about I'm saying anything but uh, it can be only one
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.200]   That can be only one
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.160]   Or athlete the phrase horsey guy is international
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.400]   That's one of the things that's you know, I started playing chess when I was a teenager in high school
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   And it's one of the great things about chess is it's it's there's there's no language involved
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.960]   So you play people all over the world you may not be able to speak a word
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.600]   But you speak over the big plane in real time or are you playing like these like postal chess
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.320]   You have uh, I think you have 48 hours to make a move right chess.com. I highly recommend it
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   It's really functional language of chess. Yeah
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   And you never know because chess.com is it is on the internet. You really it's funny
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.640]   I rarely get america's I get people from all over the world, right? It's fun
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.080]   Uh, let's see
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.360]   Daring fireball john groover mixing it up
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.680]   he uh
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.400]   Is he getting more snarky or has he always been this snarky?
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.960]   This was such a bad press cycle
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.560]   Yeah, but you know you can't say john is not
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.680]   culpable here
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.840]   He responds to the verges article about the moto 360 the smartwatch which will have wireless charging with
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.080]   These words it looks and this was on friday. It looks like moto rollers designers
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.320]   Trying to draw as much attention as they could to the 360 stupid flat tire display shape
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.640]   The only way this could be get funnier is if they doesn't even ship until after apple announces their wrist wearable
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.880]   Thing next month
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   period full stop
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.200]   Uh, he drew a lot of traffic
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   Then he tweets. Oh, I was just kidding. I don't
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.080]   I don't know. I can't believe people link to that though. I mean, I what do you mean?
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.720]   Is john groover? I mean this guy has has had very credible ends at apple for a long time
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.840]   He usually little birdies or does something to draw attention to when he's not joking or actually making a leak statement or come on
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.640]   He said next month. He you know you think that was an accident
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.840]   That's that's not how I don't I should say that I don't read his blog only because
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:07.040]   He's he's for me. He's on the he's on a list of of other commentators where if I read something that someone's posted on i'm more
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.480]   At mirrors what I was but where I'm editing right now in front of me
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.800]   I think well, okay now I can't publish this because really someone else said that today and I will look like I'm copying
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.440]   But I did I did read that and I read it as just I don't know barch at chat
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   I didn't I didn't believe his book anything also in the past. He's not
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.040]   He telegraphs things and also he's mark. He's more content to simply
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:37.760]   Link to somebody else who has said like a you know like like the great bearded one when the great bearded one says yup to something
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.840]   Groover will link to it and that is that is his way of saying that I think that this is correct whether or whether or not I know for a fact or not
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.480]   I I have great stock and what this thing is saying
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   Historically, he's just never
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:55.520]   Blabbed about hey, I have specific information about apples plants for september because that's the that's the easiest way to make sure that whoever is
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.760]   Told you that is not going to tell you anything ever again
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.520]   Because they might not be there anymore
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.680]   It might not be there anymore
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   My reputation would not be
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   Are you my uber car? Yes
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:14.240]   You ordered white panel van with no markings and mud on plates. No, it said it was a black gas because it's get your toe van now
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   I
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.760]   Going to give you a treatment we call the infinite loop
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:31.520]   All right, so this horrified you the new cycle horrified you Renee because people took it too seriously
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:37.040]   Well, I mean they they blogged and I've seen like previous years they would blog things that he said in his podcast
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   And I'm sure that you know that happens to other people too and john groover absolutely is an attention magnet and has a history of
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.640]   Correctly predicting certain things that apple would do but this
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   This was just wacky and some of the news outlets will not link to room to this to
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.960]   News items that are news items that says we believe apple's gonna do this they'll say no no no
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.040]   That's a little bit sketchy for us. We're not gonna link to that
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.240]   But a whole group or as an aside and a joke when he's being probably mean to motor all I let's put that on the front page go go go
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.880]   Okay, it just
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.520]   Do we think something's gonna happen this far? I think that I think we're gonna see a half of september, right?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:17.360]   I don't know about september, but I think this fall why would they why would they uh take spotlight away from an iPhone?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.800]   They wouldn't
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.760]   All signs point to october for and that would be the normal the anomaly the ipad announcement and
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.240]   There's not much to say about a new ipads. I have a lot of touch ID, which is not gonna be a headline, right?
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.960]   I just key there's there's that the
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:38.640]   Consistent messaging of brand new product categories in 2014 and that's the only reason why i'm sure we'll see something like that by the end of the year
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.600]   I'm just gonna be contrarian say I don't think we're gonna see and I watch this year
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.120]   contrarian
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:51.040]   We say that you ensure that we do leo. Yes, exactly. I'm always really I was guaranteed it now by saying it will never happen
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.480]   I'm always wrong. I am a committee will all be happy. I don't feel it man
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.720]   I don't feel it. I was about to say how many watches does leo have to buy to ensure that that apple will definitely come out with it
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.080]   I buy him home, man. I can't wait to the mojo 360 comes out. I'm very excited about that
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.560]   Moto 320
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.880]   and I'm not I'm not addressing exactly what I'm not really I'm not directing this at what we ever said in that post
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.320]   Although it was it was it was a fun read about this
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.040]   He makes his feelings about Motorola very very plain
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:29.120]   But you know sometimes some of us really don't look good for ourselves when there's who wasn't who had that piece about how
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.640]   I've got this
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.760]   Explosive expo say where Motorola says it's around that they have a round display technology
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.600]   But there's actually a little part of it at the very very bottom that has the display tip
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.400]   That's not round like yeah, but it's a tiny. It's not
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.680]   It's got a button
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.120]   I can't see it Andy. I can't unsee it. It's like a splinter in my mind
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.800]   It's like maybe look at the fact that it's round except for one tiny sliver
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.040]   Maybe ignore maybe ignore the fact there's a logo on the front of this phone and maybe actually charge it up and look at it
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.920]   Before you decided to piece a crap because it has a logo on the front of it. So they'll be confirmed
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.960]   That's the confirmed. We're sometimes we're sometimes not very charming as a species. We apple fans
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.280]   That's all I'm saying. We're a species species
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.640]   We're why we don't get invited to the cool graduation party
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.800]   We have to just go go candle pen bowling then go to el tareto with our three friends
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.920]   Because everyone else is everyone else is sick of hearing us
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.280]   Well, I have to point out that apple has made yet another fashion forward higher
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.560]   Uh, eve salarons europe president and retail had kathryn moñez
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:41.760]   Has left ysl started apple in the last couple of weeks this according to mark german and nine to five mac
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.240]   Uh, he she was brought in by former ysl ceo paldin f who
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.120]   joint apple last year to work on quote special projects
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.680]   Uh now her expertise is textiles
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.720]   So that's interesting
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.480]   I think retail too. She was also head of their retail. Yes said retail, but but if you look at her like her
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.960]   Linked in some part of me wonders
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.120]   You know a lot of times when we when most of have gone to uh apples hq
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.000]   You know one of the things that you kind of feel like you need to do is go into the into the apple store there
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.440]   Just be just just next to the entrance and buy apple store
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.840]   And uh sometimes you wonder if they're gonna expand when I see all these purchases
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.800]   Or all these hires you wonder whether they're going to expand making some of those
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:36.400]   Uh some of that clothing line more widely available like right now. They're just I mean they're just what sensors in clothing instead of you know
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.840]   Maybe we're maybe we're maybe there's a little misdirection here. We've all been thinking watch
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.880]   Maybe it's really the ice shirt that kumber bun
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.760]   gummer bun
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.360]   Where bluetooth festell blue tooth fences are cool
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.920]   Hasn't jason snell been saying the eye hat for a long time and maybe he's right well jason no's fezes are cool
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.320]   Fezes are cool
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.160]   How about headbands are they back? I still think apple should buy blue ball band one in every flagship store
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.320]   Uh blue bottle coffee. Yeah, do they have blue bottle coffee in my eye? I know I come when I get it
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.760]   bottle
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.760]   You have better coffee. I'm sure don't you
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.080]   Know what's the no no not in Montreal in the land of smoked meat
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.000]   You know we have good smoked meat and put in but no good coffee. Oh, that's sad
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.680]   We have to come from your yep, that's downtown. How could you not have good coffee?
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.880]   Not in my area. Oh, I think I think in canada coffee is merely regarded as a heat delivery system. The flavor is just incidental
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.760]   You're right and we have our priorities
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.480]   Uh did you read the New York Times article? I thought this was great about apples
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.640]   University
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:53.200]   Which we've kind of known about I mean this is not uh really new but I think very intriguing this idea of
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.240]   Trying to preserve the dna
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.840]   Of steve jobs and apples design focus
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.560]   by having a university which
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:08.800]   Uh employees can sign up for in fact new employees are strongly encouraged to sign up for
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.960]   uh, they have classes for instance for ceos from
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   Startups that apples purchased on how to incorporate into the apple culture
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:25.120]   Uh apparently it's very secretive that was mentioned in the jobs biography the Walter isakson jobs biography
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:30.000]   Uh the times says employees are discouraged from talking about the company in general
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.040]   And classes are no exception, but they were able to get three
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.480]   People who uh
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.560]   knew about it to talk
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.000]   Off the off well not off the record, but at least anonymously
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.760]   They've mentioned one course in which they use pakasos
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.400]   famous bull lithographs
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.640]   Uh to demonstrate how you can take a complex thing and make it simple
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:59.280]   Pakasos starts with a starts with a sketch of a bull and gets it down to just a line
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.640]   It's clearly still a bull and then they compare it to the mouse
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.840]   Which is but is that a is that a great example because the mouse is on the left
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.280]   The left two are really great and easy to use the mouse is on the right
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   So minimal
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   more minimalistic and less useful
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.440]   Uh
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.400]   One of the sweet toys says even the toilet paper in the bathrooms for apple university is really nice
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.280]   What they really need is what most of us have done with those mice
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.800]   Which is you start on the on the left there and you slowly move to the right and but there's a fifth one which is a logitech
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.880]   Yeah, the microsoft
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.840]   Okay, we're done with that was experiments
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.640]   Apple apple actually does have the the perfect mouse
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.560]   It's actually depicted there on the extreme right. That's where the customer just gives them 75 dollars and apple says
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.720]   Okay, you don't need a mouse because you got to get a track that
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.080]   Goodbye, it's a better mouse
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:57.840]   The program was started in 2008 by joe padole who is a dean at the time dean of the al school of management
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.320]   Uh, they have professors from all over some of the best
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.120]   Universities in america yale harvard uc berkley stanford mit
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.560]   Some of them continue to work at the universities while teaching for apple others have moved over like uh padole to apple full time
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.720]   The company uh, the time speculates may even offer a course specifically for beats employees
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.120]   Dr, I can see dr. Dray and jimmy. I have even the front row
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.000]   Taken notes the back row the back row
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It's over
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.920]   You may vent out the rest of the technology competition
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.120]   And find the best so long as you do not try to escape if you will all have
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.080]   That would be funny
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.960]   It's an interesting problem that they have to solve because you know apple
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.080]   It takes this culture very seriously and apple is a steve jobs product like the ipad or the iphone
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.360]   And when you have a group of people and one or two new people join it's very easy to pass on that culture
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:01.040]   But when you start ramping up and you start scaling up the way apple is and suddenly you have 20 new people joining that same sort of
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.520]   Internship process doesn't really work anymore and you have to figure out a way of passing on
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.240]   Those case studies those core values in a much larger way and that tends to turn into more of a lecture university sort of environment
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:19.120]   And it does sound in a way though like cult induction and one of the courses what makes apple comma apple
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.920]   Uh the t the professor shows a slide of the remote control for google tv which has 78 buttons
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.840]   And then shows the apple tv remote which has three
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   But again, we've completed
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.000]   Is it what I use what I use with my apple tv is my iphone
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:45.200]   There you go. Wow, that's fast. There you go. Did you do that Chad? Yeah, thanks for the uh, uh creative cloud subscription because that's
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.720]   Now it's all worth it. Yeah all worth it Chad has to have photoshop
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:56.320]   The opposite of that is a corporate culture where you have a bunch of different people working in different directions becoming futile
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.560]   You know that hasn't worked well, you know in other companies
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.360]   No, we've seen other companies although I would guess any major
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.720]   Corporation has something like this kind of
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.000]   Different eye and I think a lot of corporations think about that when they think about mergers as one of the things you see you do it
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.920]   I mean I think that was the a lot of the time Warner AOL problem was just a lot of it was called huge culture clash
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.320]   That's right. I mean there's a lot of problems with that merger, but there was but that was a specific one
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.680]   Is another course called the best things
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.840]   Which takes its name from a quote as he who quotes
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.120]   The purpose according to the times to remind employees to surround themselves with the best things
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   talented peers and high quality materials so they can do
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.920]   Their best work
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.200]   By the briars ice cream don't go for the store. That's right
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.000]   No more of this seal test
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Actually, I heard briars has gone down hills. Ah
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.880]   I'll get a toss there you go in the in the biography
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:00.880]   Isaac's that talks about uh Steve jobs literally agonizing for weeks over what washing machine to buy and having family meetings and trying to decide
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   Having empty rooms rather than filling them with furniture that wasn't perfect. Yeah
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:12.480]   So imagine how much prep your kids and your your kids have to do for the go. Okay. I got 10 minutes with Steve about the washing machine on Tuesday
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   I have a keynote presentation ball
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.840]   Hell diva. I don't think I'm full of crap. I hear this crap of agitation
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.720]   That indicates
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.360]   They chose actually she give my book. What do they choose?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.400]   They
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.600]   He doesn't want to know no brand and I want to know but he chose one that takes a very very long time
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.480]   To wash the clothes. Mm. They come out cleaner and softer
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:43.680]   Time is not the important. I wonder I wonder if if if Steve jobs calls your company and says i'm thinking about getting any washer and dryer
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.480]   Can you send one over for me to test? I bet you there's like a long long
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:53.280]   In some room over there and some and some guy with little glasses and we've looked at these and
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.120]   Actually, somebody has put the link in the chat room to uh to the quote
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.000]   Actually, this is from a wired piece in 1996
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.880]   He told uh gary isek wolf of wired. We didn't have a very good washer
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.840]   So we spent a long actually he says a little time looking at them
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.760]   It turns out the americans make washers and dryers all wrong the europeans make them better
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.440]   I bet he bought a meal a but they take twice as long or a Bosch
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.640]   To do the clothes it turns out that they wash them with about a quarter as much water
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.480]   And your clothes end up with a lot less detergent on them most importantly. They don't trash your clothes
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.040]   They use a lot less soap a lot less water, but they come out cleaner softer and they last longer
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.200]   We spent some time in our family talking about what's the trade-off we want to make
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.000]   We end up this is jobs. We ended up talking a lot about design
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.960]   But also about the values of our family
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.200]   Did we care most about getting our washed in an hour versus an hour and a half?
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.640]   Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer?
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.760]   Did we care about using a quarter of the water?
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.040]   We spent about two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.720]   That's how you hear what product meetings apple were like people were were terrified of going in there and wow
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.800]   He did get a meal according to a wired
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.680]   It is a peek into like the family dynamic where if you you you borrow the you're allowed to use the family car
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.840]   You put a dent in the right panel, you know that okay. I have to tell dad
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.200]   Dad, I was using the the knob on my washing machine and the labeling is a little bit confusing
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:37.200]   I said can you explain it to me? I know if he gets diverted for two weeks now two weeks on trying to figure out the best washing machine
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.640]   That's enough time to do this thing to get the car fixed
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.280]   By the way that meal a washer $2,000
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.680]   But softer and cleaner Leo what prices up and there are only five left in stocks. So you better hurry
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.040]   Right now
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.560]   I've actually been looking at washers and dryers because my parents they don't listen to the shows. Yeah, I'm talking about it
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.880]   I'm getting them a washer and dryer
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.240]   Look how terrible the reviews are big bucks for pieces junk eight five stars 14 one star
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.160]   I paid big bucks for a piece of junk said one reviewer
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.680]   Obviously steve did not read a man's
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:22.560]   I'm not actually sure if this is the exact brand or uh model that he bought but it was just a brand
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.320]   It was the first result when I first came to the showroom down on yes
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.520]   Yes, we have a meal a store in town. Yeah
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.960]   Never actually gone in. Yeah, I bet that machine is a great job on blue jeans and black turtlenecks
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:41.200]   All he did was just wash blue jeans and black turtlenecks in all of the washers and just
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.560]   But what happens if we do 30 washes with a black turtleneck will it fade? That's really the important
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.320]   If you guys I don't know is it true that the story about the turtlenecks
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.760]   Have you guys heard the story about the turtlenecks the japanese enough room that he he found the perfect turtleneck that he wanted
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And it had been that he really wanted to have this the specific turtleneck and they had stopped making it
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.560]   And he asked them how many would it take?
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.360]   For them to make more
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.200]   And they said oh you'd have to do a run of like 10 000 he said okay
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.600]   It was something like
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.120]   My favorite story about charles shultz where they found he had this one
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:25.280]   Still still pen nib that he absolutely loved and they stopped making them and he's for fear that he would run out
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.320]   He just simply said I don't care how many you still have in the wearing house
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.080]   I want to buy all of them
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.040]   And so he wound up with millions and millions of nibs and every time he got a new editor
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.080]   He would break this new editor in by say by inviting them over to the studio and saying that yeah
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.560]   Well, you know, I just I don't know it's just I've been doing this for now 28 years 30 years
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.360]   And I think that maybe when I run out of you know nibs
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.920]   I'll just retire and then they get patty dilly smiles
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.400]   Think into the garage and shows them cartons and cartons and cartons of every if you have the left
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.720]   If you have the one thing you love that's perfect
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:02.240]   And you have the ability to simply realize that I will never have to shop for this item ever ever again
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.560]   I have shoes that are like that. I have a jacket that's like that that if I could buy now
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:13.120]   Nine of these jackets so that I will never have to ever solve the problem of do what where do I find a nice black blazer that I like
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.280]   And I've had that money if I had that money I would spend I would buy 10 000 of these and
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.840]   And then you know good will would have every person
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.280]   Every person who's out of luck on a job interview would be in the same black blazer
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.720]   It would look like a cult which might be actually the ultimate goal
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:35.120]   Apparently the sankwa mock turtle nick in black is 175 bucks
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.720]   So if you ordered 10 000 of them, I bet you I bet you it you get a break you got a volume discount
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.680]   I bet you just got a really high thread count
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.320]   volume
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.760]   The story always was that even the t-shirts in the apple store were chosen personally by steve
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.520]   Well, you know a lot of times for a long time
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.880]   We bought all of our like when we got stuck with pixel logos on it
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.800]   We would just go to the apples store. We buy a bunch of their shirts and then we look at the label and then we buy that
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.880]   Whatever what i'm not gonna buy. Do I do research?
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.520]   That's for me. Yeah, exactly
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.840]   This is the cotton and microfiber classic long sleeve mock turtle nick in black
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.120]   Um that steve war and apparently sales went through the roof when steve passed away
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.680]   This became very very popular you can't really you can't really go out and public just like that because you get called on it immediately
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:27.520]   Yeah, and if and uh levi's 501 stonewashed denim jeans, right?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.960]   I think it was you know what i'm gonna buy a bunch of i'm tired of this
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.440]   button down look in line
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:39.360]   I did I did buy his I was I uh was had a replace a pair of sneakers. I did buy his new balance
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.600]   920 shoes, sir, and yeah, all right. They're great. They are really they're not terribly expensive. They're comfortable
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.200]   They look okay
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.160]   These are 200 200 dollars now these t-shirts are
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.640]   That turn alex have gone
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.000]   They're about 200 bucks. I don't want a mock troll like but I would love one that did they make ones that are just regular show makes
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.920]   You don't want to regularly you don't want to write. I'm telling you I used to wear turtleneck the roll over ones
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.760]   They choke you you just haven't we're not rolling it right
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.800]   You're rolling it wrong. You're not rolling right. I'm rolling it wrong
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.480]   I think steve warmocks because he it didn't want to deal with that right?
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.560]   He's like the structure he painted the back of the collar
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.240]   And that rolling it right?
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.080]   Holy cow
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.800]   Gotta do a double fold. That's it. It's not the first time that's
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.360]   Inside the bay area. Yes exactly
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.320]   I was waiting. I was waiting for that. I threw a song
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.200]   No one swung. I just I was like
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.800]   Over there like it wasn't he was it wasn't going faster in 60 miles an hour
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.120]   Right over the middle rolling
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.240]   There he's like the home run derby of the all-star game just
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.960]   I'm playing t-ball
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.120]   Out of the park
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:57.040]   Apple suppliers apparently well, I don't know I'm talking rene and andy and alex here
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.520]   I don't want to say anything, but according to some
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.320]   Bloomberg says apple suppliers have started making new iPads
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.960]   Better hurry up. They're gonna have not for october
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.640]   Yeah, you that's I mean if they're gonna announce them in october that you'd bet you'd start now right two months
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   Mass production of a full-sized ipad with a 9.7 inch screen is already underway says bloomberg with an unveiling projected for the end of this quarter
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.840]   Early next said two of the people who asked not to be identified because the details aren't public a new version
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.520]   On twit right now. It's gonna be an iphone six or iphone six s next year leo and an iphone seven after that
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.680]   Wow
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.280]   These devices are not going out of business or switching the hot tubs. Hey, will they do?
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.000]   So september 9th we talked about it last week. You concur you predicted this in the spring
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Um, we think 10 days later a week from the following friday
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.400]   They'll have it will they have two phones a 4.7 inch and a 5.5 inch do you think?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:59.600]   I mean i've heard that working on them, but you we haven't seen the same leaks in the same parts and and everything else
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.080]   So I mean, I don't know if it's gonna follow later if they're gonna announce it and release it later
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.840]   If they're gonna announce it next year. That's the advantage of apple not pre-announcing
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.280]   Things right there to beholden to nobody
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.880]   They'll if a product is ready
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.480]   We saw last year how hard it was for them to get the ipad mini to market by christmas
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.840]   They had to do that strange release in the middle of the night that nobody knew about
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.640]   And I think they're just gonna try to avoid that if they can in the future
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.880]   So people are expecting an iphone whatever they have ready they'll announce there and if something's not ready
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:31.040]   It's easy for them to either show it off like the mac pro at wwdc or even you know wait and hold it until it is ready
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:38.400]   I kind of would have this is around the time where I start to think if they were going to have a much larger screen iphone
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.800]   In october in ovember
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.760]   This is around the time where you really expect to start to see some sort of parts show up
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:52.480]   Or some sort of substantive rumor that you can certainly dismiss and choose not to believe but which has a little bit of protein in there
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.920]   And we've seen a ton for the four seven but none for the five five right
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.840]   Either we're saying the you this thing one of the tightest tightest tightest products they've ever developed or
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.120]   Maybe it's not necessarily being fast tracked for a certain date
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.080]   And to Andy's point I mean the apple is when apple has
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:14.240]   Updates of products we see leaks all the time when they have new products like the original iphone didn't leak the original ipad didn't leak
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.080]   It's only the night before if this is something different if this is not just an iphone
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:23.440]   If this is an iphone or whatever they call it it has a different screen resolution and requires something different from developers
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.840]   It could be something that's shown but isn't released till later, you know in the original apple television
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:33.600]   We're showing off in the fall and then announced again at mac world three months later. So there's precedent for that
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.720]   Yeah, so it's something really different. We could hear about it and not see it
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.760]   For various reasons there's a time in the development cycle where there's no way they can keep a lid on it
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   And so they want to control that first release
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:50.800]   So it's conceivable that they have a five and a half and they've really kept a lid on it whereas the four seven they didn't
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.760]   Well, the four seven sounds like it's shipping 10 days later and that may not be the case with the 5.5
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.480]   Well, I think I have a five this is an Android phone obviously
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:06.800]   I like five and a half inches if the bezels aren't too big. It's not a huge phone. The 1520 is that six?
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.920]   Uh, that's six. That's huge. That actually is huge. This is biggest my head. There you go
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.720]   That's this is the 1520
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:20.080]   Versus the versus the original ipad yeah iPhone. Yeah. Yeah, it feels pretty big
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.920]   I do like the 1520. I love it by empirical testing exactly 1.5 pop tarts in size. Yeah
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.840]   Five five though. This is five five. It's not it
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.160]   When I compare all this I have the 1520 in the other room. I mean I like this size
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:39.120]   That's not a bad sign. I would be really I'm still I'm still torn. You know, I have you know, I have a larger. I have the
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.840]   HTC at the m8. Yeah, that's four. That's four five even right. I think it's five even yeah
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   And I I'm still torn with whether I liked I just feel like it's a big
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.400]   I feel like I mean and and I I don't know I'm probably I'll probably get the larger one to try it
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.680]   But I find myself thinking feeling like the HTC is a little too big for me
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.960]   The HTC is also bigger because it has on on the front speaker so it makes it unusually tall
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.320]   Yeah, and then what that does a five does not have to be quite that big
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.960]   It's bigger than it would be and they and they and they and they and one of the geniuses of the of the uh
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:18.080]   Of the HTC one is that they put the lens on the convex the most convex part of the phone except for the edges
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.160]   Which means that you're guaranteed to scratch it
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.200]   So they want the zed index right?
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.320]   One of these guys thinking it's great. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool fun
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.840]   I just like I haven't scratched mine, but I do smudge it a lot. Yeah, because it's it's it's on this right there
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.000]   And they curl away from it. Let's put it right out on the edge. Yeah
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.240]   It's just to me. There's not that much of a size difference between these two
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.160]   And that might make someone say that well, then why bother if you're making it bigger at all
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.720]   For me though, it's like well if it can make it a little bit bigger, which means that when I'm showing people pictures
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.200]   Where I'm trying to look at movies and stuff like that. There really is an impressive size difference
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:59.040]   When you're watching when you're looking at photos graphics and videos on this versus the versus the smaller phone
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.960]   Uh, and so
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:07.200]   I think that you're showing a 4.7 inch compared to the iphone right this is this 4.7. This is the moto x
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.960]   I think 4.7 is is the size that you could put out and nobody would go. Oh, that's too big
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.960]   Well, again, I have I have big manly hands
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.880]   This is a comfortable size for me to swipe my entire thumb across but if I were
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:26.240]   Somewhat smaller than I would certainly see the advantage of having a narrower screen
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.920]   but
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   It's it's gonna be interesting to see what the entire lineup looks like if this replacement or whether they simply say that
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.640]   We're gonna have the narrow one for people who like something that's smaller
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   But we're gonna give you now larger size options
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.440]   And we're now even better now we're gonna just we're now we're gonna think of the ipad as a spectrum of devices
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   As opposed to just big and small
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:54.480]   Apple, uh, of course is uh has talked about uh, their new health kit technology that'll be an iOS 8 and the new health app
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:01.360]   According to writers christina far writing for writers apple is preparing a health kit rollout in mid tangled
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.400]   regulatory web they're talking with mount sina the cleveland clinic and john's opkins
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:11.360]   As well as with all scripts a competitor to electronic health records provider epic systems
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.400]   I don't know why she mentions that but uh
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.520]   The problem is and this is why they were having talks with the fda and dr mom tells me this
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.640]   Um, you have to be very careful about making health recommendations and something like this
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.400]   It's one thing to store the information as long as you're secure at your okay
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:33.920]   Uh, but it seems that apple would like to make health recommendations
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.800]   Uh, the mayo clinic is also, uh, involved there apparently testing a service
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:48.960]   To flag patients when results from apps and devices are abnormal with follow-up information and treatment recommendations that would require fda approval right?
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.640]   Um
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.120]   But I think i want the i part of this is you know, you don't oftentimes
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:03.040]   You're trying to do something revolutionary. You're not going to do what's easy. You're going to you're going to do it specifically because it's hard
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   And apple's one of the few companies that can
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.360]   Expand the money and the time and the process and have enough control over the system to actually
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.920]   You know implement this effectively and I think that that you know, I don't it seems like an almost an
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.880]   Unclimable cliff
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.720]   So but um, but if they get over it effectively it does give them a
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.920]   A lot of inroads. I'm i'm gratify my my health care providers kizer permittany
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.120]   Appair which is I think west coast only right they uh apparently are working
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:38.240]   Or kizer permittany's brian gardener who leads a research and development group responsible for their mobile offering said many physicians
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:45.920]   Thinking about how to leverage patient generated data from apps and devices. I know my doctor would love to get blood pressure readings for me every day or
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:52.560]   The big the big issue you get into with that sample rate is for and this is where I think also this this problem
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.160]   Um jumps up is do you want all that data in your medical record?
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.680]   You know, especially as insurance companies are looking at now. That's in some ways less important. Can you control it?
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:09.600]   Right, that's that I mean, that's the and well and some of that becomes less less important under abomacare in some ways because you're not going to have as many people being getting turned down for
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:16.880]   Uh, you know, their health position, but but they definitely could get charged more, you know, that that's that's really the the challenge there and so
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:23.120]   Uh, so I think that that's one of the problems with um with a lot of these and is how do you protect all that data?
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.800]   Apparently there is an optional toggle in health kit or the health app that will let patients decide
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.640]   If they wish to share data from third-party apps with apples main health app
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:39.760]   If you choose to store sensitive health data in iCloud, it's encrypted in transit and at rest according to one apple employee
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:46.800]   Um, yeah, they need to address all of this stuff. Obviously. It's fair and that's the tangled web. There's a lot of regulations
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.960]   Not to mention there are a lot of existing systems none of which interoperate
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:58.560]   Uh and there has been a mandate from the uh administration to move to electronic health records
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   And you can see kind of a
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:08.800]   Uh a utopian vision where uh, these records are portable you carry it on your phone your doctor can send you stuff
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.040]   You send data to the doctor you're being measured all the time. Well, it's also it's it's your doctor
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.360]   It's your it's your fitness consultant. It's your you know
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:20.880]   All of those things that you're having your trainer and be able to have that kind of information and know what your heart rate was and what your blood
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.480]   Pressure pressure was while you were working out and all those other things are
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:34.400]   Useful. I mean, that's what when you go to these really high end like athletes performance down in um, you know where they're really doing the high high performance athletes
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   I mean they're managing everything, you know, and that's becoming something that you don't need a big
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.720]   Front you need the trainers and the equipment that they have down there, but you don't need the
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.080]   To have a person pulling all that in not ourselves going pretty
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.480]   available
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.120]   We're talking about mac apple ipad ios
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.800]   Yo, sim we haven't talked about Yosemite. Yeah, we'll talk a little more about it Yosemite and lots more
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.400]   With our guests rene richie from imore.com from the pixel core Alex lens ease and studio yay
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.080]   He's got many new stickers on his laptop as he's
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.720]   Holding it together actually. I got this one at the geek house. We were
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:14.720]   Oh, yeah, you went down to a calley louis watch very impressive. I have to say there is this what
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:20.800]   No, it's different. It's just different. It's it's it's not the same. It's very cool. It's um, it is
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.920]   Uh, they've definitely learned a lot from this and then they're gonna have to keep up with the louis is now
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.880]   We're gonna have to upgrade our you know, I think it's two different worlds
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:33.760]   I think that they're it's much more post driven less live driven and and uh, but I think that it was it was
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:39.280]   It was really cool. I saw 30 000 r speakers that were really those kef speakers. Yeah, they don't get to keep those do they?
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:45.520]   They don't know but really nice. Yeah, I gotta say that I was like what how good could 30 000 r speakers?
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.320]   Sound it turns out they could sound really good
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:53.440]   I thought we would have nice speakers in here and then I realized you don't really want nice speakers because when are you gonna listen to it?
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:58.560]   Except when you're off the ear so no, I need if I got those I would get a room for them put them in the house a little room that
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.960]   Very quiet. Yeah, you need a musical chair. You can spend limitless money on audio. Can't you like just millions and millions?
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.480]   Yes
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.760]   Our show and of course Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times who's here with people in fizzes
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.960]   Showing their sartorial excellence
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.560]   Who are they and why are they wearing fizzes?
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:27.840]   Uh, they were standing outside at Boston Comic Con last weekend and I was walking past and they were just hanging out and he's wow
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.960]   They look like a really cool band whose CD I would buy if it was a line of fizzes
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:39.440]   Are we not men? We are dr. Who fends? I I can't decide whether they're more disturbing or less disturbing than the girl with the gun
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.160]   Yeah, what was that?
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   That was that was uh
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:51.600]   That was also Boston Comic Con. Yeah, I'm I've it's taken me three or four days. So I finally almost I'm now only six photos short of
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.760]   Posting a hundred pictures from the con uh to uh to my flicker account
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:01.360]   And so yeah, it's this this what she is actually dressed as uh rocket raccoon
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.080]   From the car into the galaxy
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.760]   So she's got the she's got the teeth. She's got the she's got the gun and when she turned around
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.000]   She was actually wearing a tail as well
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:18.640]   So I got to show you Groot the Patrick De La Hante Groot dancing Groot that he designed
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.520]   We are Groot Leo. We are all Groot
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.680]   Is Patrick here today?
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.080]   I guess not I wanted it that would be fun to show that off. He is. Is he? Is he hiding?
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.040]   Groot's not here
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   Groot's not here man
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.440]   Where did you send Groot?
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.280]   Groot's back home
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.160]   Well tune in the iPad today. I think we did a little demo of the dancing Groot on iPad today for this week
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.120]   It was very cool. He took one of those dancing daisies
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.760]   And svetlana his fiance did a groot head and he did a groot body
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:55.840]   And you plug in uh, you know something like, well, I don't know the Jackson five. I want you back and it dances
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.080]   Awesome. It's very pretty Caldwell from mackerelt has one of those on her desk
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.800]   She's been instagramming it is is it a groot so jealous
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.760]   It's just a groot mini fake like one of the big super deformed bobble headed
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   So cute
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   I am Groot
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.080]   Our show today brought to you by shutters stock
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.600]   Love a shutter stock they are now up to 40 million high quality stock photos
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.360]   illustrations
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.840]   vectors another million or so video clips
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.800]   It is a way to go to get the perfect image or video for your next creative project
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:33.280]   You know, I saw the gallant grinds a galaxy and uh with any marvel movie always stay to the end because there's always a little something at the end
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.800]   Right and i'm watching the credits. That's how they get you to watch shutter stock
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:44.080]   That's kind of amazing that a major hollywood motion picture would use I presume video clips from shutters stock as part of their production process

[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.840]   Microsoft going after apple, you know apple was used to go after i'm a mac. I'm a pc
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   Microsoft lately for its uh
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.800]   Surface pro 3 has been doing a lot of anti mac ads. Here's a
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.360]   Here's an example
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.680]   I don't understand why they haven't made
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.840]   Mac and max touch
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:12.560]   No, sorry, I was I'm still playing grute. So I was trying to get that lined up
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.840]   So the audio would have been all weird go ahead. You ready? Yes
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   Here is uh
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.280]   Are you running full adobe photoshop on a tablet? Yep, but it's not just a tablet. It's really a laptop
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.360]   It's a surface pro 3 with a touch screen
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.520]   Well, it can't be as fast as my mac sure it can and it is but you probably can't plug anything into it
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.040]   I have a usb mini display port plug away and this is my favorite. It's the kickstand
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.440]   So you're saying it does more than my mac. Well, technically you said it
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.320]   I am not uh
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   Particularly convinced by that ad yeah
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   That was that was pretty weak that wasn't as good as the samsung ads that usually say
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:59.600]   There there've been lots a lot of other ads like the nokia phone commercials with uh with their own voice assistant and uh samsung
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.440]   Don ads that are really actually cut a little bit deep into the skin and this one is yeah
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.520]   I don't need a kickstand because I have a hinge attached to a full featured keyboard
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   Yeah, it's like okay
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.800]   Here's uh, here's another one. Let's see if this is more convincing
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.440]   So it feels bad then it's my surface pro 3 it's a tablet and a laptop
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.040]   But I couldn't have the power of my mac and this is an intel core i5
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.600]   This does too. It runs office full adobe photoshop and it's got a touch screen
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.160]   I have a touch screen too
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.920]   Hmm. Well, this is my favorite thing. I can write with a pen. Well, so can I?
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.840]   Wow
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.040]   I have got a lot of stuff to carry you are more powerful than you think
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:45.600]   So that that wasn't a little closer to home. There is no and probably we never will be a mac touch screen, right?
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.360]   The problem with these ads though is that it you have to want windows to want these products and the people who use the mac
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.400]   Are you like you have to you're trying to convince them to give up os 10 not to give up a specific mac book air
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.600]   In order to go with this surface the windows market is so big
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.080]   I don't I think that you mostly just have to stem the bleeding
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.880]   Like I don't think you need to you don't need the
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.480]   Persuade mac people to come back to you. I think you just keep all your videos keep people who already have windows
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.120]   To just stick with windows and that's a massive market
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:19.360]   That's what I think they're actually doing because they're OEM partnership agreements won't let them go after del or hp or aces or
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.880]   Any of the other adobo's but by doing this commercial they could have people who are thinking about leaving pc for a mac
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.360]   Or maybe just people who don't like their current pc go to microsoft without offending anybody there
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.280]   I mean i'm i'm not one analyst said the microsoft may be losing as much as 1.7 billion dollars on its surface line
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.320]   I mean this has not been successful not has been not even a hit
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.080]   Not even not even close. Yeah, but what I think when I see an ad like that
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.600]   It's not so much they want to take market share away from from the mac
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.880]   So much as they want to identify the surface as something that has slick and as cool and as stylish as anything that that
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.080]   The thing that apple comes out with hard to do that. It's so clunky
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.200]   Well, if you see I don't know if you actually use one it's it's
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:06.640]   I confess that this is a instance in which I have the unusual advantage of being able to try something without plucking down a thousand bucks for it
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:13.600]   But once you have a full-featured pc tablet that actually works rather nice and it is really good for the things that it does
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.880]   You realize that there are times when I really don't want to have to sit like with my knees together and like tap tap tap tap tap
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.640]   Like this there are times I really do want to have like a big remote control or a big media slab or big this there the other
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.360]   I'm not sure that I would want us that it's such an advantage that I would want to have this instead
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.840]   Of a laptop style device that can really earn its money back for me
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.920]   But if microsoft can start to say that surface is that cool thing that you have heard about that you maybe you want
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.560]   Uh, that's going to be a way for at least microsoft to position themselves a little bit better than they are right now
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.840]   Which is you know the computer you hate to use every single day that the your office that your company gives you and your cubicle
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.480]   Maybe you can like it. Hey, look it comes in red now
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   what
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.640]   what should apple do a uh,
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.080]   OS 10
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.520]   Touch tablet
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.920]   I mean OS 10 isn't touch optimized and it's the same thing where apple won't do 15 frames per second video
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:10.480]   They won't do an OS 10 computer until the OS 10 interface is is phenomenal is a phenomenal touch experience
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.280]   But it is interesting that you know microsoft does believe there's something in between the tablet and the laptop
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.880]   It's sort of like the fablet is in between the phone and the tablet and the question is is there really something missing there?
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.800]   Or is that a segment the market has decided that they don't need and I keep going back to you know
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.000]   microsoft does all these product placements and I watch Hawaii 5-0 and I remember when you know one week
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.840]   They had iPads and they just got other cars started using them and a couple weeks later
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.560]   They had the surface and they got out of the car and the suspect is running away
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.320]   And they put the keyboard down on the hood and they click the thing in and they turned it on
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.300]   I swiped it open and the guy was halfway down the street and it showed how successful it was
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:51.120]   Product placement well, but it shows how successful the iPad was at disintermediating the the traditional computer
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.800]   Overhead and they were not wise to go against this
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.320]   So maybe they feel like going against the traditional computer is a better game plan
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.600]   But it seems like they're applying the same sort of strategy to this and I don't think it'll be any more successful
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.520]   But maybe it could be a very long game that they're playing because
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.640]   We've talked about this before in the show where we have generations of people for whom their first experience with a computer
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.200]   Was not with a mouse or keyboard it really was with a touch device
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.840]   And wondering what happens when these people start making buying decisions when they are in their late teens when they need to buy a computer for college
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.800]   When they are the the generation that is now
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.040]   Putting in a request at their business on what kind of computer that they want to be able to use and it's
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.000]   The iPad is way the the iPad plus a MacBook I think is way better than surface
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.240]   However, you look at these two things and I can't help but ask myself
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:48.160]   Why should somebody have two devices this powerful and this expensive?
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.680]   And that's when I that's what makes me not want to call the surface a silly idea
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.840]   Not that not that anybody has called that to you today
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.880]   But it's that's when I start to think I really wonder if
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:06.080]   The I think that I think that two devices is just as clumsy as surface is in its current form
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.920]   And that would be very surprised if five years from now someone hasn't tried to really solve that problem and simply say
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:18.400]   If you're gonna we will take $1,000 off of you and we will give you this one thing that will be good for pretty much everything
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.360]   How we defined computing here in the 21st century
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:27.120]   I think to Alex's point earlier why there's no touchscreen mac is that apple has a very successful plane and people are like
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.440]   Please put wings on the car and they're no no
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.920]   No, we're not going to do that meanwhile. They're working on a helicopter
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.000]   And if you look five years or 10 years down
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.760]   I don't think it will be far ahead of the devices that we have now
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.520]   And also to microsoft credit
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.560]   I mean one of the reasons the surface doesn't appeal to me is that windows eight doesn't appeal to me
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.400]   But maybe windows nine will and then the surface might be more interesting device
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.000]   One and I think that I mean for me the limitations I always I think about this every time I travel which is often
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.560]   Why i'm still using a laptop, you know because today I was in like economy and I'm like this little
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.240]   Like the back of the plane and I can't open my laptop and i'm just
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.080]   And I was like, why am I still doing this?
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.040]   Why am I not using the iPad?
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.920]   Well, the first reason is is because I can't type fast enough and I don't like any of the keyboards that I've gotten from my iPad
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.760]   And number two is is that it doesn't it's not a good male client
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.440]   You know, that's the number one number one problem that I have with an iPad and the number one reason it doesn't go out
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.520]   Is this it doesn't manage if you're getting 400 emails a day it does not you can't use it
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.320]   Like it just it goes into like it doesn't cash enough of them. I just want to say here's the deal
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.400]   I'll give you 10 gigs on my on my iPad
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.560]   Just don't keep it on the you download it all like my computer
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.400]   Like like just just give it just just you know, stop doing that because it doesn't search well
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.520]   I get this so i'm trying to find my my i'm trying to find my ticket for united and I and now I have to try to go
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.240]   And I don't have any wifi and I don't have a copy mail soon, you know eight two t isn't working
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.120]   So it's only things i'm sorry go ahead. That's it
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:52.880]   I just that those are the two things like if I had a good keyboard and I had a and it just would download my frickin mail
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.520]   All of it you tried any third party mail apps because they download do they download all of it?
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.920]   Nobody downloads your mailers i'm at
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.800]   No, I don't want i'm at I want it to be on my computer so I can search pop Alex, but it's a what is there?
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.640]   I don't want no, I want i'm at but I want it on my can I want it
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.360]   I'm at it is this is my computer now is i'm at but it downloaded at all. It's not pop
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.960]   But it's I want to be able to you know because the thing is is the problem is is and the search engine is you know
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.480]   You're using a gmail, right? Yeah, that's part of the problem because that's not really i-map either
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.400]   But it worked i mean here's the deal it works on my computer right like my computer works fine
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.800]   Like I can find everything that i'm that i'm looking for
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.360]   um, I just can't find it on uh
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.080]   What do you use on your mac Alex free mail what he's exactly what up apple mail?
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.320]   I use both well here's what happens is I use apple
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.960]   I don't use mail on i'm on my phone or my ipad. I just tell everyone you got to text me or use hangouts
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.240]   You know like like you know like if you want me to look at something just text me and don't forget it
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   Just like if i'm not if my computer's not open. You just got it text me. I'm done with email. I hate email
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.720]   So anyway, but that I thought I was gonna I was just gonna say that I think that points out that
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.280]   As much as I love the ipad
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.600]   I still have to acknowledge that it's very clumsy at so many different things like just to I was moderating a panel
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.560]   On friday all I had and i was having just basically a slide deck behind me
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.760]   But for the big screen so while people on the panel were talking about things I could call up images so that they could
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:22.640]   I could have it was the audience could see what they're talking about and all I had to do and this is you're you're you're listening to what i'm
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.720]   What i'm saying and increasingly angry tones to my ipad
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.920]   All I want to do is take 11 j pegs from here and have them on here
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.040]   Can when they're connected to a wire like this
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.040]   I should not have been spending more than 38 minutes trying to make that damn thing happen
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.320]   And think about if I if I had my if I had an android tablet, I could just copy them over
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.360]   If I had a surface tablet, I could just copy it over because it would be a real computer with them with a file system
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.520]   So this is the sort of thing that I think that we're going to be confronting as the years go by
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.320]   We love our ipads. We love our notebooks
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.760]   We keep we want our notebooks to be more like tablets and our tablets to be more like notebooks
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.160]   And I do think we're coming to an age where it's going to start to be silly to have
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.760]   To be for me to be traveling with three different multi-touch devices
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.240]   I'm going to be expected. I'm going to have one device that works really great for everything
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:21.760]   And it's not because it's a fridge toaster. It's because it's really the the direction that that computing should be headed
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.480]   Did you guys see the new ipad commercials yesterday?
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.920]   The new ones. Yeah, yeah, we could play those
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.720]   They had right
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.520]   Slow ride and uh that was a music one from china come on and take a slow ride
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:41.840]   Part of the you yeah your verse campaign. Uh, yeah, do you want the uh, Detroit cyclists first?
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.400]   Yeah, the slow ride. I think that was more interesting. All right, because it's more productivity. The other one was more artistry
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:53.040]   Hold on. We'll start over
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.160]   What are you doing? Are you still looking for grute? No, I'm playing it over my side. Okay. Let's play one more time
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   Oh, you're playing it over there. Don't worry about it
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.640]   Well, I kind of worry about it. Let me let's start over
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:13.920]   Hey apple mail
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   They put that in just for you
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   So if you're watching
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:39.520]   This is uh, if you're not watching this is something to do with Detroit and bicycles
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.720]   Yeah, if you go to apple.com/ipad
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.040]   They have an actual page that up for all this and they have a longer video where he explains
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:54.560]   What the slow ride is but also how he uses his ipad for social networking for communication for sketching for planning for weather prediction for all
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.640]   Is this a particular person?
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.760]   Or it's a group slow ride group person who started the group
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.520]   But the interesting thing is there's he's the just connected people talk about ipad and productivity
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.160]   Is that some people believe productivity is only enterprise?
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.360]   It's only using a computer with oracle or with microsoft or with
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.040]   You know one of those sorts of systems and other people believe that there's a whole new generation of productivity that don't use
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.240]   You know might not use office might not use oracle might not use sales force
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.240]   But they're doing things like this or they're running a startup out of a coffee shop or they're providing that's productivity. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:30.720]   Yeah, absolutely and it's mobile and it's accessible because these you can't strap a beige box computer on your back and run to top of a mountain or
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.920]   Not exactly on a ideal on a bicycle either
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.880]   Well, it's you can you can put it in a backpack very easily and take it with you and have these meetings and it again
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.160]   It just intermediates the whole keyboard and mouse and the computing things so it's it's it's like it's not a hammer
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.040]   It's a screwdriver
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.880]   So you don't want to knock nails with it, but you do want to turn screws with it and in that context
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.360]   I think that's if we try to use it for traditional computing task
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:57.760]   It's still not there yet, but it does things that traditional computer either can't go to or makes it easy enough that people who found traditional computers
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.840]   Unapproachable can finally get benefit from computing. That is by the way, Jason Hall. He's the co-founder of the slow roll
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:10.960]   city bike ride in Detroit to kind of promote the rebirth of Detroit and the this is the apple page
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.880]   Um that I like it that they do these pages at the apple site gorgeous. Yeah, because it really
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.000]   It may I mean the ad itself is a little cryptic and quick
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.680]   Um and if you scroll down they have layer like that image of parallaxes. So the guy in his bike
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.760]   Go look at that. It's kind of weird. Yeah
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.680]   Wow
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.080]   This is the they call this parallaxes new style
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.200]   I was asking our web designers way, you know that thing where you have a big picture and then you scroll down
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.960]   What's that call these help parallax and that's probably because of effects like this
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.240]   Like all my old amiga games use that to try to do my old Nintendo games
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.320]   What do you have a it's a css thing you have four grand a background one moving slower
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.000]   It's interesting. I like it. I like it
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.960]   Is it is it happening here too? No, can't tell all the pictures. Yeah, that one's not
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.320]   So, okay, so that's one and then here's the one from
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.680]   China. This is Yao band
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.760]   Uh, a Chinese musical group, I guess
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.080]   Yao band musicians, maybe they're not Chinese. Oh, yeah, they are. Okay. Yeah
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.440]   Show them using a Chinese email Chinese maps
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.800]   Playing Chinese pool
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.480]   Taking international is a big part of apple store. Oh, he's recording. I get it. He's sampling
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.680]   That's cool. Although I would always
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.240]   He's sampling with his iPad. You'd probably want a real mic, right?
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.320]   I never real mic. They make those and then
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.800]   I just think I don't want to show you that because of course it's not apple
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.360]   That would be complicated. It would be simple, right?
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.360]   He's got everything he needs to report samples
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.880]   And he's got a little NPC on the iPad. That's cool
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.480]   Yes, exactly. Hi, fatality
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.760]   New
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.520]   But what I will say is that well, and for this kind of mix, you may not need it. Right, you know
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:06.880]   Yeah, I'll band
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.960]   But what I will say that the creative apps that are being created for the iPad are
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.720]   stunning
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.880]   Like I mean, especially music. I mean, the music the music apps are I mean
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.720]   It is like that is an area where I don't know if I would use my computer anymore for a lot of those things
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.600]   Especially when you're interacting with things live and you want to have it right in front of you
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.040]   Um, you know, I think those are those are great. I mean even
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:35.360]   The mackey one that you do mackey has the one with it's got a little shell that you pop the iPad into we have we have one and it's
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.760]   It's a little simple. It's a g is relies
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.360]   Which is a
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:45.200]   Digital mic you plug into the lightning port. It doesn't good. I just got the new mickey from blue microphone that has a lightning in for
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.600]   Right review. That would be the ideal way to record right is something with digital record, you know interface capability
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.320]   Yeah, I mean you you really want a great preamp and I mean because it doesn't matter once it's digital
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.080]   But what you do is good what's analogs digital converter. So you get a really good
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.680]   You know
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.400]   Really good preamp and a really good ad and you could hook into an iPad and you get the same thing you get on your computer
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.200]   It does say that yau band captures audio samples with the iPad doesn't say
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.760]   With the iPad mic though just in the tv
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.600]   Yeah, you watch the longer video on the site
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.640]   They show you actually him doing it and him doing jams later with other street musicians using the city sounds, you know
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.160]   Yeah, looks like he may also be using an iphone in some cases too
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.880]   And that video this is cool
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.360]   Creating a vikorn baseline with i-machine
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.400]   Turning billiard balls into beats with i-machine i-machine is a third-party iPad app
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   I
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:42.080]   I was I'm sure that we all know this but I was talking to developer about what happens when you end up in one of these ads
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.040]   Yeah, and he said it's you know you sell a lot of copies of the uh, he said it was a quarter million dollars in a week
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.320]   Wow, like you know, he had a little ad and ad for your products
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.880]   I know he was just like he just it just it just flowed right here
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.200]   He was and that was the first week but he goes basically I don't need to
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.920]   I went from being this struggling little guy that was making some money on it and to not happy to work time
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.160]   I'm working on other apps now. It's not like so you can write a letter to apples that could you please feature my
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.400]   I was actually startled a friend of mine wrote me and he said i'm in the new apple ad and I said what are you talking about?
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.120]   And it turned out that he had and I didn't know but I didn't really know about this
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.280]   He had made a water pH meter
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.920]   So they could measure pH and water and they showed it off in the last iphone ad and he'd made an app that went with it
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.320]   This is the guy I've known you know 12 years and suddenly
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:25.920]   The something he made in his out of his home and started building is in an apple ad and then on the web page
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.200]   They do highlight the apps that's actually using and they didn't do this at first
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.520]   But then it became this big deal because people I mean like me
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.760]   I mean I would see stuff in the ad and oh I want to I want to find that and it was hard to find the apps and
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.400]   They've obviously made it a lot better
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.480]   It's cool
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.680]   Very neat
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.280]   Apple has now in you know when you first get an iPad and you plug it in
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:52.000]   They suggest to get the most out of your iPad here are some great free apps to get you started and of course pages numbers keynote
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.280]   They've added beats music which is not free, but
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.560]   Can you use it for free in any way or I guess two weeks free?
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.400]   But you have to buy a subscription to use beats music, right? Is there an ad model on that as well? I don't know
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.120]   Still us only I can't test it
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.800]   So on Spotify might play with certain you know we played with it yesterday on iPad today and actually kind of
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.000]   Like the the idea and Jimmy Iaveen said is right when they started beats music
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.280]   We don't we think human curation is still the best way to figure out what you want to listen to
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.960]   So they do some really interesting things for instance you make a sentence
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.240]   Uh that will be the songs that you will get to create your radio station
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.600]   So you you have words it's like refrigerator magnets that you can pull into a sentence like I want to boogie down
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.440]   With my pants off on the beach late at night. It makes that sense
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.320]   I'm not kidding like one of them is that and then it makes that
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.560]   Station for you
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.240]   And uh, so that's one way they do it
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.960]   The other one is but when you first sign up for beats music you they ask you for a number of different categories that you like
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.720]   So it's very visual. It's nicely done for the iPad and
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.560]   They really do focus on curation on human curation
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:05.200]   So I think that there's you know, it's not been taking off because frankly they were late to the party
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.840]   Everybody's got Spotify and rdo and everything else
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.560]   Google or songs and no
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.240]   But uh, this one
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.240]   You know, I was pretty impressed by it
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.640]   Not enough to go out and buy it, but that's the problem
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.200]   But apple could fix that. I mean they've got a lot of yeah
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.120]   They could build it into iTunes radio and solve the whole problem right there
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.800]   Everyone in american, australia can enjoy it. Yeah
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.360]   But that's that's why we're not the good better part of the
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.840]   That's why we're seeing as part of the uh, they suggested apps part of this campaign is going to have to be to
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.880]   Make sure that people are linking beats with apple and the public eye
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.600]   To make it think that this is part of your apple experience the fact you'd have this really cool beats logo
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.560]   The event and sticking on your skateboard for a couple of years. Yeah, here's the here's the ipad interface
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.960]   Uh, i'm at a party
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.480]   And feel like celebrating with my bff to hip hop
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.760]   And then you play the sentence and it's going to be a radio station based on the sentence podcast and i books are going to be
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.360]   Default apps and you maybe one day beats will be a default app too. Yeah
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.320]   Well, it kind of is when you put it in that list
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:10.640]   That's if you know the big button on this says download all it doesn't say download that one that one and that one
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.960]   It says download all or not now
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.520]   So the the you know most people who get a new iphone or ipad
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.640]   Will press the download all button and get those all yes, please press. Yeah, what else you're going to do
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.080]   It's going to be fascinating to see in a year's time what happens to that interface too. Yeah
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:32.640]   It does it looks it looks great. It just doesn't look very apple like so i'm right
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.720]   It's curious to see if they're going to allow it be allowed to have retained their own design aesthetic
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.520]   Especially because it's cross-platform is and it's apparently going to stay on android and windows phone right so the interface
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.680]   Made maybe can't be too apple right?
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.520]   iOS drops to 67 percent enterprise share in the second quarter
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.280]   According to good technology. This is their second. I'm sorry semiannual mobility index report
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.880]   uh
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.640]   activations by platform
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.200]   android up to 32 percent to 32 fix that and
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.240]   And windows phone flat at 1 percent
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.760]   Yikes ibm won't fix that no
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:16.240]   That's got a that's got a gripe microsoft because microsoft actually has a pretty good story with windows phone in the enterprise
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:21.920]   But nobody wants to win this phone and they spent so much money to get nokia that it's
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.360]   So you got you got to imagine that
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.760]   in their in no case defense
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   windows phone is
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.040]   Has been not quite finished for a couple of years and
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.840]   Especially in 2014 we're seeing a couple more of those puzzle pieces click into place
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:44.320]   And by 2015 it could be definitely something that is a painless alternative to android and ios
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   But is anybody could care kind of care at that point?
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.720]   I saw the very first one other than like in here in the twit
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.160]   Brick house i saw my first windows phone in the wild, you know in dc and i walked out
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.240]   I walked over the guy was like, so what do you think? What do you think of it?
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.120]   Noticable, isn't it like he was working on i was like, what are you thinking he goes?
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.760]   Because i'm getting an iPhone this fall
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   I was waiting for some guy to give me a recommendation and show me like why it was so great and he was just like
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   You bought my 1520 play with it
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   But i got it yeah
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.800]   Our windows phone community love i mean they are so engaged they are so happy with it
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.320]   I think it looks cool inside the us but they are everybody everybody i know everybody i know who has a windows phone
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.080]   They don't use it just because it was assigned to them or because oh well i fell for the hype and it's okay
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.480]   But i'm not gonna buy another one they absolutely love it
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.320]   So it's definitely fighting its audience i also should say that the third third plug for boston comacom from last weekend
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:41.280]   It's another one of those events where my eyes are really peeled for what kind of technology other people are using because everybody's taking pictures with their cameras
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.560]   And i would almost say that the iPhone was a minority device at this at this function
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.520]   And we're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of people almost everything i saw was a samsung phone
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.200]   Or and i actually saw a great many nokia phones out there
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:02.800]   So it's if if we really can't we really can't ignore the fact that there are a lot of phones out there and a lot of them are making very
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.640]   Telling very compelling stories for certain types of consumers and so that
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.280]   iOS 8 is going to be a big deal because this is going to be the first time that apple can say
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.560]   We didn't just make it thinner this time. We actually made it do cool and interesting new things that you might dig
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:22.800]   If you worked at apple and your name was sam sam song
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:31.200]   You might feel a little bit left out in the cold sam left apple. He was a apple specialist at the at the apple store
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:38.240]   Uh left apple has decided to sell his last remaining business card with the name sam song on it
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.520]   His apple employee ID and his t-shirt autographed
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.720]   Here's the good news. He's he's a selling it for charity child's wish
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.440]   Already 80 thousand dollars
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.000]   bid for this super important to say he's selling the card and giving you the lanyard and the t-shirt for free
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:06.480]   Oh, he can't he can't oh, that's interesting. Yeah, he was uh at the apple store in vancouver actually the pacific center store
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.400]   You know, I think people must be doing this for charity, you know, and by the way
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.800]   Sometimes you see these things we sold stuff at the screensavers for charity most of the bidders
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.120]   weren't real and we ended up not raising much money because they were lying
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.280]   But what ebay does now is they restricted to pre-approved buyers so
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:30.400]   The seller gets to say whether you can bid or not and you have to kind of I presume demonstrate that you have the ability and intention to pay
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.680]   So I I'm guessing that that is a real 80 thousand dollars and that's great
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:41.920]   Hopefully the sam's like an apple executives will get in on the bidding. It'd be funny. Wouldn't it? Yeah, it hangs in the sam's on corporate lobby
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.720]   It'd be it'd be night. Well, I would love to think that at some point there was the the lawyers came in and had to talk to a senior
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.160]   Apple executive and say we have to shut this down because we can't let this logo merchandise and there was and that went
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.840]   Bup up up to the top level and put back on to the bottom level
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.600]   It said okay, we've decided we're going to address this by being the top bidder on this and that's how we'll make sure that does another guy
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.880]   So we got a quarter minutes. It's for a good charity. It's good. We just got we just got the checkbook open. I love it
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.360]   They're gonna snipe it at the last minute. Yeah
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.280]   boom
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.400]   Uh, it's on the same same idea and we're going for 80 million dollars. So awesome
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.000]   JK shin and Tim cook it down to the wire. Oh, that'd be great
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   Should I press the button now? No wait wait Tim now. Can I press it now? No wait Tim have a clover relax
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   I want to press it no Tim
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.720]   All right, uh hold
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.720]   Hold
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.160]   Now we're gonna uh take a break come back with your picks of the week gentlemen get ready
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.320]   But first a word from audible
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:50.000]   Audible calm the 150,000 books strive at it's more than that now
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.880]   I should do another count
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:58.160]   If you do an empty search you can see how many titles they have at audible dot com more than 150,000. That's for sure
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.720]   Uh great books to all the new stuff comes out on audible.com everybody's realized
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.200]   In fact, we were just talking yesterday. What a great interview on triangulation with the author of the martian
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   Andy we're and I highly recommend if you didn't hear that if you ever read the book
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.800]   You must read it. But what was interesting to me is that when Andy sold the rights he sold the audio rights first
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.160]   And then sold the book rights
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.640]   Uh, and I think that nowadays that's not unusual that the audio rights are important
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.120]   And that's why it's everything including Andy wears the martian highly recommended
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.000]   It's going to be a movie with matt daman riddley scott directing next year
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.960]   But you'll see the movie in your head because when you listen audio books
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:40.480]   There's no budget that could build a set as good as the set you build in your mind
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.040]   That could build the uh the whole story
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:49.760]   I just I love listening to audio books when I drive when i'm at the gym when I when i'm cooking clean and walking the dog
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.480]   audible.com if you go to audible.com

[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.760]   About unsolved mysteries in the inexplicable universe. It could be your pick
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.560]   The great courses are there as well
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.400]   What do you listen to these days? Andy? Uh, you always have some great recommendations
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.680]   Uh, I actually had to lined up because I've actually listened to that exact same triangulation podcast
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.200]   And so of course I bought the book
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.840]   Uh, so that was that that's been that's uh, you're gonna
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.320]   That's it sound like exactly stuff up my alley
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.680]   The next thing I have actually on deck after that is a book called console wars
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:05.920]   Which I have not uh, which it was released a little bit earlier this summer. I haven't gotten around to also a triangulation interview
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.640]   Yeah, like here says yeah
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.160]   Set up as the story between sega as the lowly underdog
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.480]   Uh trying to fight nintendo back when they were still nintendo and not
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   Nintendo
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:24.400]   To to actually get a console on the market and it really i've i've only read reviews of it so far and i've talked to one person who
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:30.880]   Actually recommended it to me and it really is framed as this a very nice sort of a movie type tale of here
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.040]   Is the person who came in to sega who was the person who needed to come in to say no
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.920]   Here's how you want you want to get karly own i'll teach you how to get you want to get the
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.120]   You you you want to get the king of chicago. Here's how you get the king of chicago
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.200]   And basically laid out the plan that here's how here's what we can do that they can't do
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.800]   All the way up to now we're gonna have this adorable character called sonic the hedgehog
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.000]   And that's gonna make us everybody want to play this game and on this console
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.200]   Uh and i would go if i could have so fun. Yeah, so it looks like it looks like a great story
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.120]   It is and they actually sonic the hedgehogs
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.480]   They talk about how they got it was a contest and his original name and i wish i could remember what it's original name
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.000]   Was it was something terrible?
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.640]   Yeah, and the and apparently he was a lot like meaner looking and i'm dangerous looking
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.920]   And they start to
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.480]   No, no, no, no
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.360]   We have to we have to make that not only does this have to look good for kids
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.880]   But also we want girls to really think this is a good character
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.880]   And let me show you about the culture that says that this is going that that you need to have you know, it's
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.080]   It's everything i've read about this said that this is a really great
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:36.480]   Novel type store i like a lot of nonfiction, but i love nonfiction that's written in the form of a novel where it seems like
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.120]   There's a character and a building storyline and everything i've read about this means that this okay
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:47.200]   I will use one of my amas audible credits to to pick this one up and watch the triangulation after you do because it's great ended
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.960]   Yeah, really great stuff. So let's go ahead one less plug for audible
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.080]   I get more housekeeping done because i've got audiobooks because i remember the last time that does
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.960]   Once a year you really do realize that you have to do like a total top to bottom baseboard a baseboard cleaning of the kitchen
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.800]   And i've been putting it off and putting it off and putting it off and that's when i acquired
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.000]   Neil gammons ocean at the end of the lane and so not even intending to get the whole job done in one day
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.040]   I started playing started off by like clearing a kitchen cow and scrubbing it down and six hours
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:20.400]   I did not want to leave the kitchen because I wanted to get to the end of the story
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.080]   And so I wound up cleaning the entire kitchen getting all the stun in one afternoon
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:28.880]   Only because I wanted to find out how this book ended and that's that's ever since then it's like, okay
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.360]   Here's this awful piece of housekeeping. Here's a cleaner out of the garage. I absolutely don't want to do
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.720]   Let me find a good 12-hour audiobook that I can actually
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.120]   That I can make me stick to it because I just want to keep cleaning and keep planning up what happens
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.320]   There is a good recommendation for audible your house will be cleaner

[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.920]   Several levels higher than i'm gonna have to go all Alex Lindsay on this one
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.880]   This this is me attempting, you know to move my pawn a couple a couple squares down the board
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.040]   But it worked really well. It was so much clearer than the built-in microphone
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.080]   You could you could change the direction in many ways
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:52.560]   It's just if you're gonna do interviews or recording or anything if you're gonna sample, you know pool tables with your iPhone or ipad
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.320]   This is just a much better much more intelligent much nicer way of doing it
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.120]   Mikey mikety digital
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.360]   How much is it?
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:06.560]   It's not an Alex. I mean, let me press the buy now button. I'll find out. I think it was just under a hundred dollars
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.040]   It's not bad given that it's uh, you know, yeah, 99 99 on amazon. Yeah
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.120]   Plugs right and uh, I've used them all we're reviewing this one right now, but so far it's been absolutely excellent
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.400]   The other thing I wanted to mention it's more self-serving
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.560]   But I wanted to make sure people knew about it is we're we're changing the way we do a lot of the podcast that I've been hosting
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.320]   So the ones that you know the android central the i'mor show those are staying where they were
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.960]   But the other ones are moving to a new home. It's got a temporary shelter set up right now on iTunes
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.680]   Put the links in the show knows and tech it was the only name I had available
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.920]   And I had to set up the iTunes page
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.680]   But the thing is we're not going to be posting those shows on i'mor mobile notion nations anymore
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.560]   So if you like them if you do enjoy them and you want to keep listening to them
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   You'll have to go to iTunes or RSS for now. Oh, that's interesting. Make sure people knew that
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:58.160]   Um, do you own these yourself personally? These are those are my shows yet. Well, my my and my co-hosts shows. Mm. I see
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.760]   So i'm the tv show the tv show review debug and iterate
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.480]   Yeah debug and iterate we might keep posting you know and i'm more just because it's it's a crossover audience
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.840]   It's very familiar subject matter to them
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.080]   But the other ones you'll only be able to find them there and I don't people will email me and say why didn't you post it?
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.360]   Where is it? Where is it gone?
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.320]   So I want to try and preemptively let them know that they can still find them there
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.720]   So go to iTunes search for zen and tech
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.280]   Yes, and you'll be able to find the whole list of zen and tech podcasts
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.800]   And i'll put the link somewhere handy
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:30.080]   And i've made sections there the nice thing about having them separately. I can make my own sections
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.960]   We have one there like for example with apple legends where we just have all the interviews we've done with people at apple
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.240]   That's nice
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.000]   This week we're recording people ask for this so we're gonna do this a double header with nintendo
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.880]   Gennatra and don melton so we'll get apples ios app guy and apple safari guy
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.960]   Sort of talking about why they made the decisions that they made well you get some good gets
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.440]   It really looks awesome. That's not luck. That's skill. I know
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.400]   Alex lindsey your pick
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.760]   So in a previous episode. Yes, we found our you know we found our host looking for headphones
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.000]   So now we talked a little bit about the bows the quiet comfort
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.720]   acoustic noise canceling headphones. Yeah, I want to I want to head an ord some oh because you want it you didn't like you didn't like any idea but you
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.240]   I want to say I want to see what it looks like. I you know, so I ordered a pair I actually so i here's what i
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.040]   They're not replacing my edimatix
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:28.000]   But but I do like them for the plane. So now did you get the over the ear or the in the ear in the ear?
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.880]   Ah, these are different. Yes. These are in ear. These are the uh the quiet comfort 20
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.840]   I I guess there, you know, iphone, you know microphone everything else about $300
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.440]   They sell on the apple store. So yeah, they sell me apples for cell moon amazon. I got one amazon. Um, anyway, so
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:50.480]   Uh, they they're very comfortable in the ear. I I like them really get in there like with the edimatix and it's not quite that good
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.360]   But it's it's pretty good. It's a little bulky. So there's a little that little amplifier at the bottom or the little controller
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.760]   Yeah, and I always forget to turn it off. So I burn its battery out
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.560]   So so that i'm just not used to that habit. Um, they do feel a little bit more delicate
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.040]   So I do keep them in the case. Um, you know all the time
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.520]   When i'm not using them. I don't like it
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.080]   Because that that little um power supply is right near my iphone
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.240]   I tend not to be wanting to walk around with it
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:17.920]   That's what I found myself like sensitive of like walking through the airport with it on
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.360]   Just because it's bouncing around a lot. So I still like the edimatix for that
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:27.120]   They're a little less bulky, but I will say that it's quite a thing to be sitting in the uh in the plane and you hear the
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.000]   You hear the and then and you and you just turn it on and it goes
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.720]   You know, it's gone. Wow, you know, and so what is active cancellation even though they're in ear monitors
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.080]   It's active translation and in ear. I will
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.560]   Base respond it'll distort a little bit with really really heavy base. Um
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.880]   Uh, that's one thing I noticed a really heavy base will cause it to distort. It doesn't get as loud
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.960]   But you don't really need it as loud. I know I think it gets as loud as you
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.560]   Safely can make it. Um, I know but the uh
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.520]   Uh, it also is funny if you get your head against something like a bus or something like that
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.200]   I was taking the airport or back one
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.000]   And
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]   It does this kind of weird vibration thing that's that's a little odd because it's picking up
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.600]   It you know, the noise cancellation can have its own error errors, but in a
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.960]   plane environment or in a loud environment. It's actually a um, it's a really great
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.080]   Solution and I'm happy I have them as I said, I don't think I'd spend as much time walking around with them
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.280]   Um, you know as I do with the edimatox, but but you live on an airplane
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.360]   So I'm sure this is spent a lot of time on it. Yeah, it really makes everything else go away
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.120]   And you really are in your own little world like I'm when I'm working away and and I turn those on
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.160]   I really, you know, don't really hear anything about you know, which it might be bad if I figure
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   I'll feel the G's if we're going down
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.880]   So I'm not worried about that and I noticed they have two different versions one with a microphone and one with microphone or I
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.920]   Phone and I pat I don't think the change is the price it might change the price a little bit
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:51.040]   Right, so get the one why would you I guess is there any advantages as you would have a skip
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.720]   Well, no, no, it still does that it still does that it still has the middle one
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.160]   But I think that the one of the one of the differences is that it's a t it so the the one without the the mic will be a t
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.880]   RS
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.080]   Connector as opposed to the one with the mic will be a t rrs
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.360]   Connector which can be a little funky when you're plugging it into some things
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.600]   So when you plug a lot of heads headphone receptacles and you put a t rrs
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.160]   It's tip ring ring sleeve instead of a tip ring sleeve
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.480]   You know, you have to sometimes pull it out just a little bit to get the full signal
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.400]   So I think that that might be one reason that you'd want a standard one standard one
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.960]   But I'm obviously if you're listening to show you're probably
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.600]   Want you know a bit your t r s
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.160]   You know what kind of sleeve you want. Yeah. Yeah
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.880]   Anyway, that's it. Oh one one last thing
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:42.320]   uh, my other tip uh, the next final cut user group is uh, is this weekend or is this uh, s thursday
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.280]   So this thursday at six o'clock. Um, so we're gonna try this virtual final cut user
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.480]   Group thing again. You can go to bitly slash fcpx ug2 use group two
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.480]   So it's final cut 10 fcpx ug for user group two
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:01.040]   And that'll take you to the hazio account and you can we actually have calendar invites now
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.640]   You can like sign up cool
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.680]   And so uh, you know what we're bringing in some of the I mean really
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:12.560]   The experts of experts so final cut we're bringing them in from l.a. And and all over so um, you definitely want to
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.880]   Check that out on me 6 p.m. Live stream
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.560]   Pacific standard time thursday. I think you're right. I'm looking at this
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.960]   Uh, it does look like a tip ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring for the iphone. It's a t r r s
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.760]   Yes, the bow's quiet come for 20. I
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.480]   Yep headphones to 300 dollars
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.400]   But worth it. Well, you spent a lot of time on the plane, you know, it's that's it's just
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.920]   It just really depends on how much time you uh, and I can back him up on this
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.520]   I got like them too. Yeah, I flew with uh brian brushwood and he had them
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.440]   And it's kind of amazing that you have them on you have them off and the moment you flip them on
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.400]   All of the noise in the airplane just disappears. You take better than the over the ear ones
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.680]   Yes, well, uh, it's harder to sleep with the over the ear ones
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.880]   Right. Well, the other thing is the reason I don't like the over the ear ones is because I um, I have a very constrained supply of
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.360]   Space in my bags. So the over the ear ones is just way too much case
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.720]   You know for me. So I the reason I actually own the over the ear ones as well
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.480]   I just don't use them because I I don't want to pack them and you have to charge them ahead of time or you have a little box of charges
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.320]   Charge them ahead of time. Yeah, but I always have those I have those little power gen batteries. Oh, yeah
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.640]   Yeah, it's micro usb charges. It's my command easy easy pz
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.520]   Uh, let's get an anecho's pick of the week
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.240]   I have a tip and a pick uh last week before we're talking about the inadequacies of the apple tv remote
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.520]   Someone on twitter reminded me that there is actually a menu option inside the settings
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.360]   We go down to on the apple tv settings to general and then to remotes
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:45.360]   You can actually teach the apple tv whatever remote you happen i already have in your hand right now
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.680]   So if you've got so if your cable company gives you a multi-function remote and it has like one of those
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.120]   options for like vcr you might not be using the vcr so you just aim the vc
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.400]   Aim this remote at the apple tv
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.440]   Tell it this is this is the up button. This is the down button. This is the left button
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.800]   This is the right button and now you can use this just as well as the stick of gum
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.600]   These aluminum stick of gum that apple gives you inside the box
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.560]   Uh, so I totally forgot about that and so I would not have found it if he'd not uh reminded me of it
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:18.560]   Uh, so that was uh, that's pretty cool. Uh, the second one is a neat little sound utility for the mac called sound bunny
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:25.040]   And it's a $10 app 30 days for free trial what it does is it gives every single app running on your mac
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.280]   It's own individual sound control and this is useful for a couple of different things
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:34.160]   Uh, for instance, let's say that you're in a mode in this afternoon where you want to listen to music
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:40.320]   But it is really important for you to hear when a skype has a someone is calling in for skype or something like that
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.600]   You can you can dim most of what you're doing and make sure that skype is always the loudest thing in there
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.680]   Without having to go from app to app to app and use their individual settings controls
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.680]   The other thing is sometimes you've got an app running that is making more noise than you would like and you just you don't want to quit it
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:02.240]   But you do need to mute it. Uh, and this will allow you to simply mute an individual app. Um, I found this yesterday when I
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:09.760]   There is a there's a bug in safari so that sometimes when an app is making sound there is no indication in the menu bar
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:13.360]   The the title bar of the window that this is making sound at all and some
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.640]   Dumb website was auto loading music in after about two minutes of being open and because it's my it's the end of a workday
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.200]   I've got like five eight different windows each with 10 different tabs on them
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:28.400]   And I didn't want to have to quit safari and lose my workspace
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.280]   So it took 20 minutes of my time to track down
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.480]   Which one of these tabs was causing all the noise and if I had had this app installed before
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.800]   Uh, you do have to restart in order to make it work
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.800]   If I had this this this done before I know that I bet it's a far. Yep. It's a far. Great
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.720]   I'll just keep safari muted and just keep on going because I don't have time to deal with this right now
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:49.920]   So 10 bucks is not a lot of money for something that's this useful
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.440]   And you do get a free trial that you can figure out if it's actually going to enhance your life in a productive and positive way
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:01.040]   And here is a video of patrick de la jantis
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.680]   Uh, groot
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.640]   Dancing to
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.640]   Music
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.760]   That's my pick of the week. You can't buy it in stores
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:16.720]   You have to know somebody as cool as patrick and svetlana yet marvel watch this and do it
