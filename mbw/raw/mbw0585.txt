[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.240]   I've got snow on the ground already,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.440]   Alia, which is here.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.120]   Winter is coming.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   Yes, now it's here.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   Wow.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760]   That's amazing.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.320]   That's amazing.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.520]   Yo, it's pretty chilly here.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.000]   We're getting down to the '60s now.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Oh!
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.480]   I feel terrible for you, Alia.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.200]   How you guys are alive?
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.160]   Actually, it was more like 48 the other night.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.960]   That was really cool.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.120]   Alex Lindsey, also joining us from his jaunts
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.800]   around the world of the Pixelcore Good to see you.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.000]   How's my Skype connection?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280]   Your Skype connection.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.600]   As usual, perfection itself.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.880]   It's like, I feel like I'm here.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.800]   I feel like I'm in the room.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.440]   It's amazing.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   And from the Chicago Sun Times, the lovely and talented Andy
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.960]   and I co-
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.920]   Andy, I see you.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.760]   Hello.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.560]   Greetings from high lunar orbit, from the crew of Apollo 14.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.200]   Sorry, but no, no, no, sorry.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520]   The only reason I don't care that much is that most people
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.920]   listen to shows.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.280]   In fact, I think we're really kind of more coming to the
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.200]   conclusion that video was a bad idea.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.240]   Obviously, it's going to come around.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.920]   As long as the audio is good, well, you know, it's a time
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.760]   thing for most people.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.720]   They don't have time to watch something.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   They have time to watch.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.520]   It's really like this.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.280]   Just people talking and they might as well just listen
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.800]   in the car, right?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.600]   So nobody knows your audio's delayed.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.080]   It just sounds like it's right on time.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   I don't care.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.720]   As long as nobody knows, I didn't shave this morning.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   That's fine.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.880]   Actually, your audio-- somebody's saying, I think that's
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   actually an accurate way of putting it.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.840]   Your audio is on time.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.640]   Your video is off.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.480]   His video is fast.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.360]   Your audio is perfect.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.120]   All right, not perfect.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.160]   Well, maybe perfect.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.760]   The best laptop ever made, Marco Arment, to read his piece.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.040]   About the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro, it's ostensibly the
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.680]   2015 edition, although you could still buy it in the
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.280]   Apple Store.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.880]   No touch bar.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.720]   You know, it's missing some of the neat new features, but it
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.640]   is SSD.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.440]   It does offer quad i7 processors, plenty of memory.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.960]   And it has jacks.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.760]   It has ports too.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   I will.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.520]   You like this one?
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.280]   Yeah, I think it's the best.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.520]   The MagSafe.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.440]   I still have it.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080]   I'm using one right now.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.800]   In fact, there's newer ones out there, and I'm still using
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.880]   the Apple--
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.480]   Full-sized HDMI.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.880]   You still get Thunderbolt, which is nice, too Thunderbolt.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.680]   You get a SD card reader.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   Golly.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.360]   I think Apple would have--
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240]   they would have been fine with the transition if they just
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.560]   put USB-C on one side.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.280]   Just taking the word of the HDMI and the USB and the SD card
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.360]   are, and just made that two USB-Cs.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.160]   And then left our other side, at least for a version or two,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.080]   left that other side there to allow people to kind of
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.000]   transition.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.440]   Other reason Marco likes it is it has a 99.5 watt-hour
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.400]   battery.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.720]   I did not know this, but the carry-on limit for commercial
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.120]   airlines is 100.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.840]   So it's right just as scoosh below the Macs.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.800]   I wasn't making any that are over 100.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.360]   I mean, this is--
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   Well, sometimes you hear people complain, like, why don't
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   they put more battery in a tablet or in a laptop?
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.880]   And legally, they would not be allowed to ship it to you.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.320]   They did.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.400]   So that's why sometimes there's speakers and things
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.640]   that take up spaces.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.480]   So 99.5 watts-- so you're getting good what hours.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.720]   You're getting good battery life, even though it's a giant
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.000]   screen.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   I came-- after reading this article, it was the
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.640]   middle of the night.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.560]   I came this close to buying one.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.600]   I thought, no, I can't.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   I can't bring myself to do it.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.680]   I have--
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.240]   But the question really-- the reason I bring this up, first
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.480]   of all, it's Marco.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.960]   And I think he carries a lot of weight in the Apple world,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.760]   is what is Apple's going to redesign, I imagine, the
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.560]   Powerbooks--
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   a MacBook Pros this year, 2018 is coming here.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.240]   Would they ever abandon things like the touch bar?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'd say, you know what?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.120]   We were wrong.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.680]   Oh, no, I don't think so.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   I don't think they would ever abandon the touch bar.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   I think that they would have to keep it as an option in
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.800]   the product line.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.200]   My question is going to be, do they take a step back and
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.160]   return to at least the 2015, 2016 style keyboards?
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   Do they take what they consider to be a step back and
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.880]   actually put an SD card reader and an HDMI port and a
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.320]   standard USB-3--
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.200]   excuse me--
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.840]   USB-A style port for USB-3 on the side of it.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   Because we've been over this time and time again, and I
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.320]   always hear from people who are very, very sad when they
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.000]   hear me say that the new MacBook is not a good computer.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.080]   But you're not alone.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.360]   I mean, I know it's selling well.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   Exactly.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.520]   I'm glad that I'm no longer alone.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.680]   I'm glad that I'm no longer sounding crazy.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.320]   But it's like, I think that this is--
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.920]   I gave a talk in which I just--
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.360]   I gave a talk last week at a PHP world.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.320]   And I might be misremembering, but I mentioned in
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.000]   passing, talking about every single tech company that was
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.640]   out there and what's going well, what's going poorly for them.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.120]   And I just made a comment about the MacBook Pro.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.880]   And I think that was an actual applause break.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.400]   I'm like, oh, God, the hate to take you.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.480]   Give me your hate.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.680]   It makes me more powerful.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.880]   It's telling that Apple still sells this model.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.080]   I mean, this really doesn't fit in.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.800]   They have a tradition of holding on to the old one while
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   they're doing the new one, often because government and
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.680]   other big businesses, they certify from IT that, yes, we
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.080]   will allow our people to put in a requisition for this
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   computer.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.080]   They will not have done that for the new model until they've
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.360]   had time to take a look at what it does.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   So that's one of the reasons why these things stay on the
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.400]   price list.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   Go ahead.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.160]   I say this as someone who--
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.000]   I have both.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.600]   I have the 2015, right?
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.040]   2015 MacBook Pro.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.280]   And I have the most recent MacBook Pro.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.040]   And I literally never use the old one unless there's some
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.640]   obscure VPN app to connect to.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   I like the new one better in every single way.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.600]   But as someone who writes about Apple for a living and has
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.520]   an audience, it is unacceptable that half my audience
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.320]   really dislikes it.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.760]   Not that they find it worse than the original, but actively
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.680]   hates the keyboard and hates the things.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.480]   And that's a big problem, because one person can like it
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.000]   or not like it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.240]   But you have to have a computer that you're selling to
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.800]   everybody.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.280]   And I have to wonder if maybe when they move to Face ID and
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.880]   away from Touch ID, they can sort of call a mulligan and
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   just say, well, because the reason the touch bar exists is
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.040]   in part for Touch ID, because they have to have a separate
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   display that would show Apple Pay so that nobody could
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.400]   hack into it and mess around with a different number
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   of people who are in the market.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   And they're not going to have a different amount.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   So that's all driven by the Touch ID and the T1 processor.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   And if you sort of pull that out and make it Face ID, you
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   could say, well, we don't need this anymore.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   So we're going back to this.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   And oh, by the way, you know, we've heard you about the
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   keyboards and these have so much more area.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   And I think USB-C just didn't materialize the way Apple
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   hoped it would.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   They hoped it would be a huge amount of USB-C gear on the
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   market.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   And I just hasn't.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   And I think they have to realize that as a very stark
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   reality as well.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   I doubt that they'll go back.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   I mean, the problem is it doesn't really matter.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   I mean, from a bottom line perspective, I mean, they
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   want to keep moving the technology forward, but I don't
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   think that they're going to bother to change their
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   their dies.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   You know, you know, plus they're selling wells.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   I mean, do matter what we say.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   We see them as the maximum selling.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   It's a different market though.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   It's a mainstream market.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   The professionals are not happy and that's quarter
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   there.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   That's quarter there.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   I mean, I think most people that I see that are using
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   them are definitely folks that are managing people, not
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   necessarily in the trenches.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   I mean, we've got probably, I don't know, we've got lots
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   of these retinas and they are workhorses.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   I mean, we have been, they have been on every continent
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   and all kind of hot coal.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   A few people, I would include myself say it's the last
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   use good MacBook Pro.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   Maybe the last one.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   And it may be the last forever.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   That's so disappointing.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   It's especially problematic because the only pros are
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   a special breed.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   They're usually, they're using apps that they're not focused
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   on loyalty to a brand.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   They're focused really on here's how much time I spend
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   and here's how much money I get paid or I earn for every
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   hour that I spend.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   And most of the tools that they're using are actually
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   either multi-platform or there is something just as good on
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   the other side of the fence.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   So they're really in a position where if it's not, if it
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   doesn't, if these people don't feel as though this last
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   MacBook is just a freak outsider.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   Oh, well, they may one crap MacBook.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   Okay.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   Well, I'm sure they'll be back on form the next time.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   I've been increasingly less satisfied with the MacBooks
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   that they've been forced to buy over the past X iterations of
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   buys that they've made.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   That's when they start to say, okay, I'm going to give up.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   There's, it's stupid that like every time that I decide that
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   no, this isn't the year I'm going to buy a Windows notebook that
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   has all the features I want, all the power that I want, all
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   the convenience that I want and costs probably cost less money as
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   well.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   No, I'm going to stick with my Mac.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   That's the day that they jumps ship.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   They have to be an Xcode developer to be in a position where you
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   have to, you need a pro laptop and you have no option but to
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   buy a pro MacBook.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   Is the iMac Pro going to make pro?
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Let me ask Alex this since you're the most likely to spend $5,000
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   on a new iMac.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   Is it going to make pros happy and is it going to calm the waters?
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   I don't know if it'll calm the waters.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   I think what I really call the waters is a Mac Pro that
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   is closely in development.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   In development.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   You know, something that really looks like, but I think this is
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   going to, my guess is, and I have not heard, I don't have any
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   inside information at all, but I think that Apple went to Pixar
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   and said, you know, what would you guys use?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   And they gave them a spec and then they built something to that
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   spec because, you know, a company, like a production company
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   doesn't care, you know, the cost that we think about $16,000 for
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   workstation, that's not a big deal because, you know, the most
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   expensive thing is labor.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   You know, so it mean fast and easy to use and easy to manage.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   Those are all things that are very valuable to a production company.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   This is such a beast.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   It would support three 5K displays, the internal display and two
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   external displays.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   That's a beast that can't wait.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   And it's base grace.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   You know it's expensive.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   It's base model has 32 gigs of ramage and get up to 128 gigs.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   Base model has eight core Xeon processor, but you get to 18 cores.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   It starts with a terabyte SSD, but you can go to four terabytes
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   and on and on and on.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   I mean, the bar for me is that it's still on a radian.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   I mean, you know, it's I really prefer an Nvidia.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   Everybody would.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   Apple is so tied to ATI.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   Well, it's Apple wants to control the drivers and the video
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   wants to control the drivers and that's why they, that's why they
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   don't.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   But heads because the promise is that a lot of the OS runs uses
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   the drivers.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   And so the problem is is that if you, if Nvidia got behind or
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   something didn't work, it's an, it's not just a, oh, your game
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   doesn't run fast enough.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   The whole OS doesn't work.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   And that's the, that's the, that's Apple's issue and Nvidia
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   issue.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   And it's not like the, it's not like the windowing server isn't
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   completely broken in high Sierra anyway on graphics.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   Yes.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   It does, it does respond to the, the ports issue it has on the back
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   a lot.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   All of those ports that should have been on the MacBook Pro.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   It's got four type C ports for type A ports, both you.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   And then it's going around this time.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   It's got an SD card slot and it's got a ethernet jack that
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   supports 10 gigabit ethernet, which I mean, we have 10 gigabit
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   ethernet, but I don't, I wonder if even Pixar has 10 gigabit
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   ethernet to the desk.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   That is great.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   I have fiber.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   I don't think that is a little bit of future perfect is okay in a
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   $5,000 to $10,000 computer.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   I would say that's a good point.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   And it's also important to say that the IMAP Pro, they can
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   really go nuts here because there still is the mid range IMAX.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   They're going to be available if they, if they want, if people
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   want a more conservative design, if they want a more affordable
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   design, the I7 based IMAX are still super, super powerful.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   They are workstations for people who do not work at Pixar.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   And for people who don't have, you know, an Alex level need for
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   intensity can do just fine with an IMAX.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   And so it just gives them a top level option.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   I think that what Apple desperately needs to keep side of is
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   that again, they're the only manufacturers of Macintosh
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   computers.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   So they have to produce everything that is needed, not
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   necessarily everything that users want, but every, every model
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   that users need in order for this to be a vibrant portfolio
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   of computers.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   And so if they, so if they only have the pro level thing and
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   then they've got a $1,000 kind of crap computer, but nothing
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   in between, that's a bad thing for the foundation of the future
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   of the Mac.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   I think that's, I mean, I would have never said this five years
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   ago, but I really wish that they would license the OS and just let
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   people build what we want.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   If all they did was, if all they did was allow it to be bought,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   to be to run in virtualization.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   If they were allowed to run in virtual box, even if it were for
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   the, the OS is always free if you're running on a Mac hardware
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   for $100, we will sell you a version that will, that is licensed
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   to run or has the hooks to run in the virtual box environment,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   which is an open source virtualization tool.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   That would solve so many problems that so many people have.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   I mean, the main thing is the hard part is, is that it would be,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   you can't, you can't, the only reason that we would want to have
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   customization is for speed.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   So if the virtualization is slowing it down by even 10 or 15%
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   you wouldn't get any hardware acceleration.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   Sorry?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   It's my guess.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   You wouldn't get any hardware acceleration is my guess,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   which would be a very different experience.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   So are we burying the stinger here if we don't mention the, the
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   A10 processor in the iMac Pro?
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   That's actually where I was going next.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   This is against even, uh, Troughton Miller has, uh, is that his
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   name?
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   I always get it.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   I always try to dismiss.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   And Jonathan Levin have once again, parsed source code.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Uh, and according to the bridge, OS 2.0 software package from
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   Apple, it appears that the new iMac Pro will have its own A10
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   fusion code processor.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   That's the previous generation processor in the iPads.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   And this is currently in the iPads.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   And, uh, why, why Renee would it have an A10 processor?
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   So for a couple of reasons.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   So we saw this with the T1 in the Mac Pro.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   It allows Apple to create a secure environment so you can do
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   things like touch ID and Apple pay without worrying about a lot
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   of the hardware attack factors that you have in a more
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   traditional computing infrastructure like an Intel, uh, and, uh,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   and OS system.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Uh, and it's going to let them do secure boot on this, which
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   probably is the inverse of what Alex wants with a free
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   boot.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   Mac OS, but it'll let them.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   There is some concern that this, that, that would like future
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   versions of Mac OS require this preventing hack and tush is for
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   instance, the hard work.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   But it would let them verify.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   Exactly the opposite direction of what we, what we want.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It would also let them do things like handing over because the
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   Intel processors are still hungry, even if they do a very good
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   job of sleeping, they're still hungry.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   And you could offload a lot of tasks, including things like Yo
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   Simbo instead of, you know, Siri thing, whatever I can't, not a
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   lot to say.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   But if you could hand power nap off, you could hand all sorts of
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   system processes off so that it would not have to wake up the
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   big and probably getting bigger because, you know, there's a race
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   now between AMD and Intel who could throw more cores and more
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   threads at things without being up that big, hot, heavy
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   processor and just do everything on a nice cool arm chip off to
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   the side.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   But also, uh, it could, uh, it's not a first step into an arm Mac
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   OS though, is it?
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   They've had that for years.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   I mean, they just haven't pulled the trigger on it.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   And they probably manifest not in an iMac Pro, but in a, in a
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   small Mac book where they control the entire thing the way they
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   do an iPad Pro.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   Although the only thing that kind of got my, when I was reading
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   the story that got my curiosity up is remember that this is
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   going to, this is probably going to be one of the most attractive
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   things for Xcode developers to, to buy as their, as their build
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   machine.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   It's kind of interesting to at least think about what emulator
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   or a, there have often been complaints from developers about
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   saying that there are things that they would have, they have to
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   now find a once or twice I've had to, like, because I have a
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   library of about pretty much everything that Apple has made or
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   at that time I will have like a loner of the new like 17.2 inch
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   iPad Pro Delta, you know, like I'm, I'm fortunate that Apple will
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   not allow this person to deploy something in the app store until
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   it's been tested on real hardware and no, the emulator will not
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   work for these purposes.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   And so they need to get a, get ahold of real hardware stuff like
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   that.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   And also if in some, again, future proofing there, if you're
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   spending five or $10,000 for workstation and let's say that you
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   are inside Apple and you know that there is going to be something
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   for which is going to be really, really useful and helpful for
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   developer to be able to test against an actual iOS style
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   processor.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   It might, for that reason and also all the reasons that Renee
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   mentioned, it might be a good reason to let's round this up from
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   $7,991 to an even $8,000 by including a $9 mobile CPU in there.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   If you were going to go to the processor, the smoothest way to
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   do that would be to have it sharing the board and slowly taking
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   processes over rather than trying to just do a big swap.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Just say, it would take years.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   It would take years.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   Yeah, they have that.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   I don't see Apple doing something like that.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   I find them more about trying to tail off dependency on the Mac,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   moving more people to iOS directly rather than try to move
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   Mac on arm.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   Although, like I said, for the first time the Macbook
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   Nothing came on board that it really does look like, you take it
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   apart and it looks like something that was designed to run off of
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   an arm or a mobile processor because it's just such a tiny,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   it's like a phone style board that's running Mac OS and it
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   made me, it got my interest level up again about, hey, maybe they
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   aren't really thinking about introducing a line of arm based
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   Macs either to get the price down or to give us the, make sure we
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   still get that 12 hour, 13 hour, 14 hour, maybe 18 hour battery
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   life on a Mac instead of envying the 10 or 12 hours that I'm
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   getting on my iPad.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   There is an arm chip in the Macbook Pro, but that's just for
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   the touch bar.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   The T1.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   For Apple Pay.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   And it would be interesting to see like how quickly with all of
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   these, we're going to get facial recognition, you know, and the
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   feels like...
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   How fast can they make those sensors?
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   What?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   How fast can they make those sensors?
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   We have facial, you know, we have windows hello, face
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   recognition in windows devices now, it works fairly well.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   Right.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   And that's what...
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   You do have to have a depth sensing camera.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   There is more than just the regular, you know, logitech.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   I mean, it's, it's, it's interesting to think about the
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   differences of what the, what the security means on a desktop
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   versus what it means on a, on a phone.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   On a phone, you're worried about leaving this thing behind some
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   place and then someone picks it up and now can do online banking
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   from your device.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   You're worried about how you just leave the room and your kids make
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   purchases with a desktop computer.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Once they are physically in front of this screen, they kind of
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   own the home, they're, they're, they're, they're basically trying to
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   do what they can do now that they're sitting in front here and they
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   have access to USB ports.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   And the, the, the idea of having a H.L.O.M.O. working on the
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   desktop, that's the probably it from my experience and from talking
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   to other people, it seems to be the least useful place for one of
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   these voice assistants when you're, again, sitting, sitting in
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   front of a computer with a mouse and a keyboard, maybe you don't
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   necessarily need a voice assistant, but you need as a window that
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   you can type commands into.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   It's nice, but you don't necessarily need it.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   Apple needs to have a cylindrical object sitting on a table that can
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   respond to voice commands.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   And we'll get to that later on, I'm sure.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   It's not the, that's a really valuable thing to have.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Excuse me, it's not as valuable a thing to have on an iMac.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   I guess I, I guess unless Apple sort of working on something different
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   because they have their voice assistant on multiple devices from your
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   iPhone to your iPad to your Apple TV, eventually the HomePod now with
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   the Mac.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   And if you think about it the way you think of like a mesh router
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   network and you start having mesh assistants where you don't necessarily
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   have to put them in every room, but you have multiple devices that can all do
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   that voting process and determine it.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   Once you string those together, it could provide something pretty robust.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   That's fairly unique to Apple because not many people have that wide
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   array.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   I mean, Google probably, but not many people have that wide array of
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   assistant devices yet.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   And I think that there's a, there's a future where we're not using
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   passwords anymore.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   And, and I think that being able to have biometric on everything that I
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   own is something that is part of that future.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   I mean, I just, every time now you get used to using like your B of A app
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   and putting your finger down or looking at your phone.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   And you just start thinking about how stupid having a type long password.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   Just when your computer recognizes you and without a lot of effort logs you in.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   I had, it's funny because for years with phones, we had to type the code.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   It was just like animals, like animals.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   And long comes to study.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   And now it's just, we just expect to use it right away.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   I got my 10 and I didn't think that touch ID.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   I think I thought that Renee was over overstating the whole like, Oh,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   it's a pain.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   Put your finger down and everything else.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   It is.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   I still have my seven.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   I'm still like on my way back on the pixel today and I can't, I'm using time.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   I'm like, Oh, I got to put the fingerprint thing.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   Cause I forgot it existed.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Like I got to the point where not always, but often enough, I forgot I was
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   actually doing authentication.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   Right.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   And now I'm doing it again each time.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   Right.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   So make sure we think kind of big about this though.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   Like on a desktop, imagine, you know how you're not supposed to, but you see
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   the verification checkbox on, on Twitter, you know, the social media services saying
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   that this is definitely an end out goes account because he has, we've proven this is who he
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   is.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.680]   So now you know, now you can also do a Google search and find out more about this person
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.400]   who's saying such nasty things about Star Trek three.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   Imagine something similar to that.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.000]   If there were a, if there were a broad standard for like 3D face ID so that not by logging
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.240]   in or anything, but just by the fact that I'm sitting at the computer and the Twitter
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   or my Twitter, my Twitter client or my Instagram client or my Facebook client will put like
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.160]   a purple check, check box simply saying that, Oh, by the way, via face ID, we have authenticated
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.280]   that the person who said this is Andy and not go definitely Andy and not go.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.240]   So that was sort of obviate people trying to be trolls on the internet, political parties,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.800]   trying to pretend to be somebody else.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.200]   It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it would be a bad, it's a stupid thing to have face ID
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.280]   on a desktop.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.560]   But that's the cool stuff is going to be stuff we can can't really think about right now.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's going to be the stuff that makes us really realize exactly how we can improve the world
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.080]   by making sure that fools have to stand up and say, yes, I'd be that.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:48.120]   And I totally get that the, there's a value to an on anonymous being, especially in an
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.600]   oppressive regimes and so on and so forth, being able to say things anonymously, whether
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:59.240]   or, or be able to do it as a, as a whistleblower, like there are reasons to have anonymity,
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   but we, we managed a lot of events, a lot of big events that have a lot of comments and
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.400]   we've demanded them on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, like all these other things.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.320]   And the difference between Facebook and YouTube are dramatic because, you know, the YouTube
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   comments are just useless.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   I mean, because it's all anonymous.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:22.520]   And so you just have, I mean, the most vile pile of horrible nuclear mess on a big event
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.920]   in YouTube to the point where most of our clients just turn it off.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.200]   And, and Facebook, you can actually, I mean, there's some, there's some rough comments,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.320]   but nothing like what you see when people don't have any, uh, modifications of big problem
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   all around.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   And it is interesting.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.440]   I think you've already made a step in that direction though.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.000]   I mean, it's even with touch ID, the fact that you could buy stuff at the Apple store
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.840]   and touch ID to authenticate was Apple's way of doing it, at least internally.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.480]   And I'm not sure when this emerged.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.800]   Is it maybe with the iPhone 10 and face ID?
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:57.600]   But I noticed that now when I log into apps and I log into websites, Apple offers to save
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.480]   the password in the key chain.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   Is that new?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   Really?
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   When did that start?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.960]   So, so that started before, but you would have to authentic, you, you couldn't authenticate
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   to do it.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.920]   You would have to do it manually.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.420]   And they thought that touch ID was kind of too slow for that process, but with face
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.360]   ID, they thought it was fast enough that they would just auto fill it for you.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   It's very long.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   As they can register face ID.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.800]   And that's the beginning, I think, of this face ID authentication, but it's only on the
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   iPhone right now.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.000]   But I was shocked by it because Joanna Stern posted her review and I hit the link and
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   it took me to the Wall Street Journal login page.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   And I wasn't expecting anything.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.720]   I thought I would have to start typing it in and it just, it did the little spin around,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   filled it in.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.440]   And I was at the review and I just tweeted her back, like, what happened?
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.800]   It's so awesome.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.880]   So you have to give permission to record the password the first time you log in, right?
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.640]   And from then on, it will store it.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.000]   You just have to say, it'll say, do you want me to say this in key chain and you say yes.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.640]   So it's important to realize one thing though.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.200]   So I never use iCloud key chain because it doesn't have a master password, like Last
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   Pass or One Password.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.880]   And I never wanted to be in a situation where at a conference or at an emergency, I handed
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   somebody my phone and suddenly they had my credit card data.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.800]   And that hasn't changed, but it will do face ID.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.760]   So what I've done is I sort of bifurcated.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.640]   And now all my really important secret stuff is still in One Password, but I don't really
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.840]   care if someone else logs into the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.680]   So anything that I consider to be trivial, I now put in iCloud key chain.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.240]   Plus the fact that it's backed with face ID makes me a little bit more reassured by that.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.480]   So I started using it for exactly the same reasons.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.840]   I don't use One Password, I use Last Pass, but I had the exact same thought in my head.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.520]   Well, I'll do this for non-critical passwords because it is so damn convenient.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.400]   So I go, yeah, Wall Street Journal, I'm already in.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   And you're right in.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:45.600]   Yeah, interesting article in the Apple Machine Learning blog, Machine Learning Journal, about
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.920]   how face ID works.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:55.840]   They're using an on device deep neural network that was originally created in an academic
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.880]   environment.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.720]   And I forgot the name of it.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.480]   They say it down here.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:08.080]   But this is really over feet, over feet, F-E-A-T.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:16.000]   And this was popularized, some simple ideas that showed DCNs to be quite efficient at
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.760]   scanning an image for an object.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.360]   So this is academic research and now they're applying it.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.840]   If you're into a machine learning, I think this would be probably a fairly interesting
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.000]   article to read about how this all works.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.120]   Apple's a little peek inside the kimono about how they're doing this.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.720]   And it does, this is how, this is, Renee, am I right?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.640]   This is how it's learning to get better.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.000]   I mean, when you stop to think about it, again, like when they're describing it, it's less
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.120]   like coding a machine or coding a computer and more like training a pet, which still
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.640]   scares me because if the Terminator came back now, he would not go to a phone book and say
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.440]   Sarah Connor, he would just sort through quickly Instagram, learn what official features are,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.840]   start scanning for gate analysis and walk right up to her.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.440]   So I'm like, come with me.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   Totally.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.080]   They really are learning and improving.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.440]   And I think after you let them lose, you're no longer responsible.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.960]   They start to improve faster than you actually realize.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   It's really.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.320]   So good article, machinelearning.apple.com if you want to read more.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.000]   I really thought it was interesting about the heavy, you know, the idea that you use heavy
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.200]   iron to get most of the, most of the work done and then just hand off the mostly, it's
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.040]   like, it's like basically I thought of it as like pre-cooked meals.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.360]   It did point out though that because Apple's iCloud photo library is cloud based and due
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.400]   to Apple's strong commitment to user privacy, we couldn't use iCloud servers for computer
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:44.920]   vision computations because they encrypt the data before it's sent to cloud storage.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.280]   So bringing deep learning based computer vision solutions to our customers, we had to address
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.160]   it directly the challenges of getting deep learning algorithms running on the iPhone.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   And that is.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   They have the advantage.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.320]   They're biggest, like Google for sure, Amazon, their biggest advantage of the servers, Apple's
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.120]   biggest advantage is the silicon and you look back at it and they were building the neural
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.520]   networks and three years ago, I mean, they started that project and I was like, again,
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.880]   I'm living on the, well, I said this before the show, but I'm living on the Pixel 2 XL
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   this week.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.280]   And there's just little things I noticed like when I pulled up the phone and I went to portrait
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.240]   mode, I thought it was broken because I didn't see anything different.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.360]   And it took me like 10 minutes to figure out that I took the picture, then went to photos,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.280]   then opened the photos, waited a few seconds.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.120]   You would look at the photo and apply the, take the depth mask and apply the blur, but
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.000]   it wasn't doing it in real time.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.120]   And that's the sort of thing that Apple can do on the device in real time in the photo
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.200]   viewfinder.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.160]   And that's the same thing that's letting them do like it's not anywhere near a giant server
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   cloud, obviously, but it's powerful enough that they can do the facial recognition locally
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   and provide the privacy.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   That's what a lot of this article is about is how you solve those problems because you
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.440]   can't use big iron to do it on, you have to use on the phone resources.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.000]   With more, we will talk about the HomePod now delayed.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.740]   And actually, Mark German's amazing story of how the HomePod happened almost didn't
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.240]   happen and a whole lot more.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   And of course, and this just happened this morning, the FCC has announced its plan on
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.200]   repealing net neutrality.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.200]   And we'll talk a little bit about what that might mean.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   And that's something everybody's a little bit nervous about.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.160]   Our show today brought to you by The Tracker.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.640]   If you ever lose stuff, you're going to want to find the tracker.com/macbreak because it
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.440]   is, and by the way, the website's harder to find than actually anything else after you
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   get the tracker.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.200]   T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com/macbreak.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.320]   The tracker is a small coin sized device.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   Actually, there's two of them.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.960]   There's a tracker Bravo, anodized aluminum, size of a quarter, very lightweight.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.480]   And then the new tracker Pixel, which I really like, it has LED lights in it.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.640]   It's the smallest Bluetooth tracker ever made, it lightest.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.960]   And it really is great because you could put it on your wallet, you could put it on your
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.200]   keys, you could put it on your remote, you could put it on your bike, you could put it
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.360]   in your luggage.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.040]   You could put it so small, you could put it anywhere.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   And I have it on my keys.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.120]   And I love the fact that it lights up because how often is it that you drop your keys somewhere
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.320]   dark like in the couch cushions or in your car?
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.920]   And those lights make it really easy to find.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.040]   Separation alerts mean if you leave your phone behind, your keys will howl at you.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.960]   If you leave your keys or your tracker behind, it'll, the phone will howl at you.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.320]   You can even press a button on the tracker because of instant find my iPhone that'll
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.040]   make the phone ring even when it's silenced and vice versa.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.480]   Whenever you leave your tracker attached backpack, let's say behind, you can look at
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.840]   the map on the app and see where it saw it last.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.560]   And if somebody should take that backpack and move it, they have the world's largest
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.880]   crowd locate network, which is amazing.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.640]   Anytime anybody with the tracker software walks by your tracker, it'll ping you and say your
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   tracker was just seen here on this place on the map.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.000]   So it makes it possible, since there are five million trackers out there in the world, makes
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.520]   it possible to find a misplaced item almost anywhere in the world.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.680]   Don't worry about losing anything ever again.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.720]   You could find it with the tracker.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.600]   And by the way, trackers 30 day money back guarantee means you have nothing to lose.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.080]   One of the things I really like, unlike some of these other Bluetooth devices, the batteries
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.920]   replaceable on both the tracker Bravo and the tracker pixels.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.880]   So it goes and goes and goes and then you put a battery in it goes and goes and goes
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.040]   some more pick your color, pick your tracker and then take 20% off your order.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:37.280]   However large the tracker.com/macbreak the tracker.com/macbreak for 20% off your order.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   What a great holiday gift.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:44.080]   If you're giving expensive devices for the holiday season, put those in the stocking as
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.520]   your great stocking stuff.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.160]   The tracker.com/macbreak.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:54.560]   HomePod, it ain't going to come out in time for the holidays.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:01.640]   Early 2018, according to Apple, a brief statement said the production process needs a little
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.200]   more time.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Yep.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   We'll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia early 2018.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.040]   I don't even know when that is.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.280]   Before June 30th, I think in US Samoa, is that right?
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.280]   Is that the date line?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   It could be as late as that.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.280]   Why is it held up?
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.840]   How hard can this be?
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.480]   I mean, like it's if you look at what has come out.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.280]   So a series kit for HomePod has shipped.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.440]   That is done.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.000]   And my understanding is all the series stuff is done.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.200]   But AirPlay 2, which is a big part of this because it has no auxiliary port in it.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.920]   Everything has to be streamed over AirPlay 2.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.720]   AirPlay 2 was briefly in a beta, but it hasn't been in the most recent data.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.040]   And it's not out yet.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.640]   And if you start looking at everything that's involved, because AirPlay 2, the original
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.040]   AirPlay, there are rumors that it was like a weekend project.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.240]   And some people say that's true, some people say it's not.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.840]   But either way, it was something that could just very quickly move audio and video signals
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   around.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.920]   But it was never robust.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.080]   And AirPlay 2 is much more robust.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.360]   It's better protected.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.080]   It's more reliable.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.480]   It's got a much bigger buffer.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.400]   And it also does multi-room, which is something the original AirPlay didn't do.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.520]   And something that a lot of people really wanted it to do.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   And that has not shipped on iOS yet.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.600]   So and it's a huge part of HomePod.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.000]   So I would think that that is probably the reason why.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.080]   Well, that and everything that is associated with it is probably the reason why it's not
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   that much.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   That's hard stuff to do.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   To do in a way that won't get you in a lot of bad reviews.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.880]   I think it also kind of points to a really bad organizational problem at Apple.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   We've had a consistent thing that I've been hearing about and that we've been seeing in
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.640]   the actual field is that there is the stuff that Apple's focused on and then there's the
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.800]   stuff that they have to make time for.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.360]   And so you don't have the organizational structure at you have at some other companies
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:57.960]   where you might have like here is our home entertainment speaker division where the most
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.040]   important thing they feel they're doing in the entire year is shipping out this new smart
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   speaker.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.760]   Whereas with Apple, one of the greatest strengths is that they have a very holistic view of
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   the company.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.480]   They're making one product, which is the Apple Omniverse.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.600]   But the thing is it's once you have the favorite child, the iPhone 10 that has a big math exam
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.200]   and they're really stressing out about it.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Now mom and dad both have to make sure they buckle around the iPhone X to make sure they
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.160]   make sure it's happy, make sure it gets released.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.400]   The other kids have to get ignored for a little bit.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.920]   I'm sorry for tortured analogy, but that's the really the best way of doing it as a young
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.120]   just child in a large family.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.240]   I know all about being ignored in favor of more favorite children.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.720]   And it's just it's really embarrassing for Apple to make such a huge announcement at
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.520]   WWDC.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.040]   And apparently you would do it only when you're pretty sure about your timetables and not
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.200]   being able to even commit to all what's going to be delayed until we're taking pre-orders
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.960]   now, but won't be able to ship until January 18th.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.280]   The fact that there is no date for it.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.140]   The fact that it is we are going to give you until we're going to give you a date that
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:08.600]   could be anywhere up until June says that, wow, a lot of organizational stuff went horribly,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:14.280]   horribly wrong in order for a mistake of that magnitude to happen, especially in the
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:21.600]   well ended here with a product that was just locked and loaded to make a fort to sell 10
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.640]   times as many as they could possibly take orders for.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.120]   You talk about a cool looking Apple speaker designed by Apple that looks really cool.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.840]   That makes incredibly good music.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.160]   That is semi affordable for an Apple product.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.680]   And it's going out for sale right before during the holiday buying season.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.960]   Oh my freaking God.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.120]   That's like jumping out of the airplane.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.160]   Then, well, I did strap something on.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.280]   Let's just see if it's a parachute.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.600]   You don't make mistakes like that.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.400]   The only mistake that Apple made was announcing it, in my opinion.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.920]   The issue is that all of these companies have trouble getting products out the door.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.880]   So they all have timelines that are moving.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.200]   They all have things that they were sure of that they're no longer sure of.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.640]   That is what all these technology companies are doing all the time.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.120]   They have things that stretch out by months or weeks or years or decades.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.000]   I mean, they have all kinds of things that aren't working and little glitches.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.200]   I'm developing a piece of software that was supposed to take a month and it's now a year
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   into it.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   That's the stuff that happens.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.960]   You can't just throw money in more development.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   The process.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.120]   No, because it's a handful of people that are thinking through it.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.800]   And so you can't add any more people just makes it more complicated.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   Because now you've got to buy a car.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   These people say, well, Apple's so big.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   They have so much money.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   They have so many people.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   They should be easy.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   But it's not.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.080]   The reason that some people get paid a lot of money at these companies is because some
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   programs are a lot better.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   It is seen.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Yeah, well, and it's seen.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:50.240]   We talk about a lot of the actual, like if you're doing, let's say, compositing or whatever.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:56.680]   Let's say it is not the skill set of me doing what I need to do to do that is not hard.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.280]   It is seeing the difference between what's good and bad, seeing the difference between
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.560]   what should be there and shouldn't be there.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.640]   And there's a handful of people that do that well.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.320]   And as you said, there's a handful of people that program well or not.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.560]   And the number of people finding someone who's a good programmer, finding some programmers
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.040]   is one thing, finding good ones.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.600]   If you're good, you don't worry.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   You don't worry.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.960]   Like the guy who complained about Google's policy.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.040]   I bet you he had a job.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.640]   Regardless of quietly, somebody hired him probably the week he walked out.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.520]   Because there's so much demand if you're a strong programmer or a mediocre programmer
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   that it's a lot of time.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.960]   But it's also the Mythical Man Month problem, which is even if you could get a programmer
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   that's that good.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.400]   You can just throw them into the mix and say, "Okay, this is going to make it twice as
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   good."
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.240]   If you, every person you add down, might slow it down and may increase it by 10 or 15%.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.880]   I mean, that's the reality because there's just more pieces.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   And I think that...
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.720]   So that's an interesting point though, that the mistake made was merely announcing.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   Just announcing it.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.120]   I mean, they could have come out with it next year.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.040]   I think the problem they feel is, I think, that they, as it said in the article, they
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.080]   felt blindsided by the echo.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.600]   And there were a couple of things I found out, this is Mark German's reporting, which
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.840]   coincidentally came out, the same day Apple announced it was going to be delayed.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.520]   I wonder who was his source.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.000]   In any event, this was originally prepared as a speaker.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.160]   They heard the echo, they got the echo, the day it came out and they said, "You know what,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.320]   the speaker's not good.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.840]   We could make this with a better speaker.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   We got Siri.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.640]   We could make this with a better speaker."
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:29.480]   So it was really about audio quality initially, less about the Siri ecosystem.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:35.160]   At one point, there was one that was three feet tall.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   Three feet tall.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   And here's the problem with it.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.360]   I bet that speaker sounded good.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.800]   No, there were a ton of...
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   This has been...
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.680]   Apple's been working on speakers for a long time.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.080]   We saw one with iPod, Highfly, but they always have these projects.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   And they do tons of prototypes.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.360]   The reason they have a lot of those machines is so they can spit out endless.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.200]   We saw it, Johnny I've have every eighth of an inch sized iPhone to figure out the two
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.640]   you actually wanted to ship.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.680]   And this was a side project initially as well, right?
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   They're almost...
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   I mean, it's a company.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.280]   So they have so much money and so many creative people that anything that we could dream up,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.920]   they have the resources to prototype.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.520]   Mark says they wanted to beat Bose.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520]   They wanted to beat JBL.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.160]   They wanted to beat Harmon Carden.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   It wasn't really the end of the echo.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.320]   Yes, Siri was incidental at first.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.120]   It was just a convenient way to control it.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.720]   And then when people started becoming a category, you have to rethink how important Siri is
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.800]   to the overall product.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.000]   And they were still, for various reasons, still focusing as a speaker.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.760]   But if there is a knock against Tim Cook here, it's that not just that they announced it
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.480]   early, but there is a theory in Wall Street that...
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.000]   There's a theory that he feels pressure from Wall Street because it keeps saying Apple's
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.880]   not innovating and Apple is behind.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   And it's not true.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.480]   Like the Apple Watch didn't have to come out when it did.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.000]   The Watch Market was nascent.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.080]   The Home Assistant Market now, there is an incredible reality distortion in America because
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.920]   you're lucky to have so many of them.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.000]   But the International Market for Home Assistance is tiny and very immature right now.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.120]   So there's no reason to rush this to market.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.520]   There's no reason to announce it.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.960]   But the knock on him is that he feels so much pressure by Wall Street in these questions,
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.840]   like why is an Apple in this category that they do announce these things early.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.480]   And then he ended up waiting for Apple Watch when it does come out.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.480]   There's not enough supply.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.280]   You end up waiting for a home pod or air pods.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.440]   And when it comes out, there's not enough supply.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.360]   And that's exactly what Alex and Andy are saying, that it becomes a complete perception
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.280]   issue that is almost entirely self-created.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:26.240]   And their development for two years before it actually even became an official project.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.720]   It's run now by the former R&D chief at Bowers and Wilkins at BMW, which makes some of the
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   best speakers in the world, Gary, at Gives.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.640]   And two years ago, it got its own location.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:46.400]   And by 2016, they were testing the device inside homes of employees not connected to
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   the audio development.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.320]   So it was interesting and they tried it.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.640]   Was the beam forming was a big part of it?
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.560]   Can we make great speakers that are there?
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   Well, they have for years an iPhone.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.520]   They announced that iPhone 4 as well as has Echo as has Sonos even has beam forming in
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.680]   some of its speakers now.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.160]   Well, I mean, that's why I think that Apple, I don't think they were necessarily wrong
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.240]   to announce it at WWDC if they were completely confident they were going to make the date
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.720]   because they are getting in really late to this market.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   It is vibrant.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.320]   They are selling hotcakes everywhere.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.600]   And the competitors are not sitting back and waiting for Apple.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   No, I asked a bunch of that.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   Everybody knew that.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.920]   It's totally not vibrant though.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   It's very small.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.920]   It doesn't make a lot of money yet.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.360]   It's not really a marketing that Apple would typically manage it.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.800]   Yeah, 50 million, like Apple watch is bigger than that and that's considered a failure.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.480]   Okay, well, if I sell 50 million units of something, I'm really happy.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.240]   It's not not everybody has to be.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   Not everybody has to be Apple.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.920]   Apple didn't have to get into the space.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.680]   But if they were going to get into the space, if they're going to lay claim to somebody's
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:48.000]   350 bucks for some sort of an audio product, they are going to have to make sure that,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.160]   again, if they went around the room and said, look, we're going to go through every single
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.360]   one of you and you're going to say go or no go.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.880]   Are we going to be able to ship by the end of the year?
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.000]   And if the answer consensus is that yes, we can ship this home pod by the end of the
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.800]   year, it's a really good.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.880]   If they're going to sell it anyway, you'd better say that by the way, if you're going
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:11.440]   to be spending $350 on a Sonos product or on a Bose product or someone else's product,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.800]   maybe you want to put that money aside for our product, which is not ready yet, but it's
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.480]   definitely going to be shipping.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:22.000]   But the thing that I got out of German's article is that it feels as though Apple, this is a
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.680]   case of Apple being way too precious about the design for this thing.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.320]   I think that the Apple Watch is a really great example of how you don't have to get it all
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.520]   perfect in the first go.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.560]   It was really terrible with the the hardware was always wonderful, but the software had
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.720]   no sense of identity.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.880]   It had no point of view.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.680]   It was confusing, not just confusing for a wrist top operating system.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.200]   It was just it made me wonder, did the people who designed this know that this is going
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.240]   to be worn on a watch and operated with a fingertip?
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.520]   It was so bad, but it gave them time to do a couple of iterations to dial in on exactly
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.040]   what people wanted these for.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   And you don't know what people are going to buy something for until you make it available
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.920]   for them to buy and then watch them use it.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:08.080]   It also might be a little gunshot after the failure of the Apple Hi-Fi.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   That was three.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   That was eight years now.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   That was a that was eight.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   That was eight.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   That was eight years ago.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   That was somebody else.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.600]   But I'm saying that the fact that Apple didn't immediately didn't immediately notice that
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:23.840]   yes, the the the the Amazon Echo doesn't have a great speaker, but people are not spending
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.240]   a hundred and fifty two hundred dollars for a tiny little tabletop speaker that is going
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.360]   to take the place of their Stonehenge speakers and their five thousand watt amplifier.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.760]   They're there. It's a it's a place to put something they're going to put in an office
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.440]   or in their kitchen and the fact that they could set timers with it and do five thousand
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   things with it.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   That's why people are buying it.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.000]   So the fact it was it always seemed to be interesting from the get go that they were
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   not saying they were they're kind of skipping over the reasons why people are using Google
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.440]   home, the people why they're using Amazon Echo and they're saying if you're don't don't
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.240]   buy two hundred dollar speakers that will definitely fill the room with beautiful sound
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:06.880]   buy this one little grapefruit sized speaker because it's way way cooler and but it will
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.720]   also do automation and will also improve our lives.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.200]   No, no, no, but imagine the sound you'll get from this little grapefruit sized speaker.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   And again, I don't doubt that it is wonderful sound, but that's not why that's not why I
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.920]   buy a three hundred dollar speaker.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.880]   It's why I buy two Amazon Echoes.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.080]   That's why I buy three Google homes.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.960]   I think that you kind of need it to be that though.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.920]   I think it needs to be a great speaker because I mean, I own a Google home and I own some
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:37.240]   Macos and I have a you know, the little screen one, what are they called the show and the
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.760]   you know, I won't the thing that I think is funny is they're putting all those work
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.520]   into Siri and and I, you know, I don't need that or necessarily want it.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.800]   I won't put it in my office.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.680]   You know, I don't put any of those things in my office.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.040]   I mean, I'm like going to discuss things that they're focusing on being a good speaker,
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.480]   which none of those devices are like are as very useful.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.800]   My my wife uses in my kids use it all day.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   People don't care, Andy?
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.160]   No, I'm saying there when you once you start spending three or four hundred dollars, there
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.800]   are a lot of really awesome speaker, PC type speakers that and Bluetooth speakers across
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.760]   three or four hundred dollars and they don't do it by being forming.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.160]   They do it by often having to and to discrete speakers you put in two different corners
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.080]   of the room and they don't actually take they visually they take up even less space than
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.440]   the the home pod.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.900]   I don't I don't think that apples again, I don't think apples being stupid for pursuing
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.780]   this line of view, but it would have been more interesting in hindsight if they said
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.640]   let's just have a really good apple design speaker doesn't have to be the greatest,
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.040]   but it will be shipping and it will be very good.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.640]   And over the course of the next one or two years of having to endure pundits like Andy
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.120]   and the rest of the people on blogs and stuff saying, Oh, look how badly this is.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.640]   Okay, I would never complain about how badly something is selling, but just just for just
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.200]   for example, we'll have to endure a couple of years of pundits talking about how badly
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.960]   it's selling what a disappointment it is until we have that Eureka moment after looking
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.080]   at how people are using this and will do new not even new hardware, but new software
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.860]   that gives it complete and utter devastating relevance.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:07.320]   And I think the watch market is also you come back to another good example of Apple got
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.500]   in late on that one and then just took over.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   You know, I mean, like there was a lot of watches out there that were doing relatively
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   good and then let's not forget that the AirPods are so labeled and they are pretty good
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   speakers.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   They go in your ear.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   They don't fill the room.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:29.000]   Do any of you I'm curious tap your ears and have you Siri on your AirPods?
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.480]   Yeah, although I mean, it has more options.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.120]   But I was 11.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.960]   It has more options like you can you can have it do for skip for and skip back.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.200]   And I turn it on to those just to try it and inevitably I want to do something else.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.920]   And then I can't ever send a text from your AirPods.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   Yeah, sure.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.160]   I use it when I'm walking and stuff and if you don't think of this, I never do it.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.020]   And I think Siri has gotten much better in iOS 11.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.140]   I'm a little more likely to use it, although my only problem with it.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.340]   Leo is like, remember the old days when you had server farms and once in a while it wouldn't
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.820]   work and it's because you hit one server that was out of date or was down.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.840]   That's what Siri always feel like.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.220]   I can tell it to turn on my lights 10 times and eight times it'll work fine.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.060]   And two times it'll say, sorry, we can't turn on lights.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.060]   What do you mean?
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:16.340]   I mean, you're just like, I'm hitting that one server that just is down or is just not
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   enough.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.480]   I take many of those experiences to sour you and on the whole experience.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.180]   I'll tell you why this has come up for me because I got the Google Pixel buds, which
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.120]   by the way are an insane disappointment.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.360]   I have to get them anyway.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.520]   But there's a good argument for not releasing something on time.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.160]   Well, I don't know what's happened.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   Mine have stopped pairing.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   I can't pair it to anything.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.240]   I have to, I guess they broke.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   I don't know.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.840]   I used them once.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.640]   But the thing that was interesting and I did try for a day wearing them all the time and
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.700]   using them to connect with the assistant and sending texts.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.440]   And when you get a ping on your phone, when you get a notification of any kind, it reads
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.660]   it to you, gives you a chance to respond.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.080]   And I found that a very interesting case for wearables useful.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   But I haven't done that before.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080]   Don't wait for the translation.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.080]   Answer the question.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.560]   The translation is a problem because it, well, it's just a problem.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   It doesn't work very well.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.920]   I think that when you look at some of the patents that Apple pushed forward and one of
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.600]   people working on, I do think that you're.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   They fixed blueing towards.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   Oh, they fixed blue too.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.240]   And everything that's wrong with the Pixel Buds has to do with Bluetooth, frankly.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.720]   But I think that their, I think Apple is moving, they're going to release in the next two to
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.240]   three years, a earbud that is designed for you to just leave it in your ear.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   Like it's just, you're just going to put them in and connect to the rest of the world.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.400]   And that's kind of what I wanted to do and was doing one day, the one day they worked
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   with the Pixel Buds.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.200]   And that was actually because at the airport picking up my son and it was very useful.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   You felt like you were connected.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.400]   You didn't have to pull your phone out of your pocket.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   And I had a product called the Motorola Hint that was.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.800]   It was a Bluetooth earbud, but it wasn't stereo.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.520]   It was only one, but it also came like the AirPods in a charging case so you could wear
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.680]   them all day.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.600]   And it really hit itself very, very nicely.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.440]   There weren't any antennas, little stubby antennas sticking out.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:05.680]   It just sort of like, you know, spackled over the loops in the world of the inside of
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   your ear.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.880]   So you really didn't know that someone was wearing one until they turned and looked this
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880]   way.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.460]   And in addition to being able to take calls with it, it really was just a sensitive touch
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:20.680]   pad so you can tap it and then talk to Motorola Assistant or what would then become the Google
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Assistant.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.480]   And when I was trying it, it really was one of those things where I kind of wish that
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:32.400]   I didn't, I kind of wish that I didn't, I wasn't a human being because human beings
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.760]   like have earwax and the idea of wearing this thing every single day and having to clean
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.520]   it like every day or something because to make sure it doesn't look quite so nasty because
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:45.480]   it was super convenient to just be taking your constitutional and have still having like,
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:51.200]   you're not having your sound field cut off by headphones, but still be able to tap and
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.320]   say, well, when is my sister's birthday because I'm passing by a floral shop, I don't know,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.960]   I want to make sure it comes on the 20th and not the 22nd.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.840]   And then just get these incidental things that little bits of information that smooth
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.680]   your day or little taking little notes without having the cost of having to divert your attention
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.600]   to looking at a phone or even be wearing these stereo headphones all the time.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.040]   It's a great idea and I hope that other companies pursue it.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   I'm surprised.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.840]   My back hurts next because like when I look at the screen, my head's down and it starts
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.400]   to hurt after a while when I'm walking and now with the AirPods or others, I just leave
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.440]   my head up, phones in my pocket and I feel so much better.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.080]   I'm surprised that Apple hasn't bought a company like Phonak, like just just bought
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.800]   the whole company.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.080]   They're a hearing aid company, very high end hearing aid company.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:41.000]   And we use them in broadcast, the wireless ones, because when you see them in like 24,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.280]   like Jack Bauer puts them in his ear, they don't work for miles, they work for 100 feet
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.320]   in studios, but they're so good and you just feel like they're not stereo, they're not
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.160]   like music quality.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.920]   But when you think about what they've gotten really good at as being able to isolate all
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.520]   that stuff and actually improve that.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   And if you look at the audience that Apple continues to look at is many of us that are
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:14.400]   aging that are going to need to have augmented hearing, I think that there is a massive market.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.440]   If you look at the health market in general for Apple to get into the kind of the, I think
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.760]   that Apple's going to move towards a hearing aid that is not a hearing aid.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   They make it cool.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.720]   It's going to be an insert that you can hear better than you normally, than you ever did,
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.400]   as well as have music, as well as have assistant, as well as have, and it'll be certified and
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.800]   all those other things, but Phonak's probably the leading one.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:41.680]   They do everything from hearing aids to security to intelligence to, I mean, they have a lot.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.520]   They expect a whole different websites.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.280]   If you look at it, there's whole different websites for the different industries that
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.840]   they cover.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.280]   And so like you go to the Phonak one, all you see is hearing aids, but there's a whole
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   other one that's all entertainment and there's a whole other one that's all defense.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   Interesting.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.920]   Yeah, look at the wrong products, obviously.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.480]   Government services, so go to the Government Services page, hearing instruments, wireless
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   accessories, yeah.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.960]   Those are the little bottom ones, or just the ones that just sit in the ear.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   The nice thing about the ones that are more hearing aid-like, I actually have Starkeys,
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.880]   which look very similar, is that you can have a lot more room for the battery that goes
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.320]   behind the ear, and then there's just a little implement in your ear, a little floating
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.720]   little speaker.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.280]   Apple has been served with a warrant to unlock the Texas shooter's phone.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.720]   Turns out to be an iPhone SE.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.880]   Blood-spattered iPhone SE.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.280]   Apple has yet to officially respond to the warrant from the Texas Rangers.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.560]   That's an encrypted phone.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:49.320]   Which encrypted phone, which they sent back to Quantico without doing anything with it.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.280]   So they said they didn't put it on his finger.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   Right.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.160]   Well, you can't understand them doing that.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:54:01.520]   The real question I bet is if this warrant covers just the phone, or I'm suspecting it
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.840]   covers the iCloud backup as well.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.920]   And that would be, of course, where you would find the data if you're really looking to something.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.240]   I don't think this is about this case.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:17.000]   I think that, remember, a couple of weeks ago, a Deputy Attorney General in a address
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.040]   was pretty much calling out Apple particularly and sending signals, if not saying outright,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.560]   that they were looking for something to make a test case out of.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:31.080]   To say that, look, you do not have the right to conceal a secret from the government.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.120]   And that if you are manufacturing technology that allows people to conceal a secret from
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.680]   the government, you must have a backdoor in there.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.640]   And I think he even used the statement, I'm probably paraphrasing here, that no rational
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.920]   person would deny that the law enforcement has a right to the data inside a phone.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.400]   It's like, me?
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.840]   Maybe I'm not rational, but I'll say, no, you don't.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:57.480]   What really undermines the argument is the NSA leagues mixed with the fact that the San
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.440]   Bernardino shooters had no data.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.960]   Like, after they actually broke it in, it was not in there for a million dollars.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.560]   And there was nothing there.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:11.160]   And although in this case, we know at least he called his father, we believe he also might
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.800]   have called other people from that phone, those call logs, but they can get that from
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   the phone company.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.360]   So I'm not sure what I don't know.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   Right.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.480]   And I think it gloss over the fact that Apple is willing to help law enforcement up until
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.880]   almost the very, very end of their abilities.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.440]   And the only thing they're not willing to do is do something that they feel compromises
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.400]   the security of every iPhone everywhere.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:38.800]   And they are particularly, as Alex said, all these tools, the NSA has them, other people
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   are going to have them.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.440]   If they if they create either a tool or if they create a vulnerability in iOS that allows
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.680]   a backdoor for law enforcement, somebody's going to have that.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.360]   And it's not just, and it's not just going to be people and people trying to get your
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.280]   phone numbers, getting your banking information.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.640]   We're talking about, hey, let's we're talking about a foreign government trying to say it
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.800]   would be very, very useful for us to get access to the secretary, an assistant to the secretary
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.560]   of the Treasury's phone.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:11.040]   So we know that we will just use this $200,000 vulnerability we bought to make sure that we
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.000]   can remotely get into this thing and take a look at his call history.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.400]   It's like, that's the sort of, that's the level of the threat that is presented when if Apple
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.280]   were to say, yes, we will weaken iOS to make sure that we can find out what was inside
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:29.960]   the head and the phone of a horrible killer who decided to kill themselves or get killed.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.920]   Well, so I correct myself.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.480]   The warrant was for iCloud content.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.040]   Then there was a more general warrant issued separately to allow law enforcement to access
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.040]   the phone.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.960]   So there, there were two warrants.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.880]   Well, and it seems like they're going to have to get to a point where law enforcement
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.160]   is trained on how to take care of how to manage phones.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   This is so important to them.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   It seems like in both cases, Amber, and this shooting, you had law enforcement making
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.520]   mistakes that probably locked up the content.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:04.480]   And so this is something that they need to have a little tech training on how to make
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.320]   sure at least they did all the things that they need to do.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:13.040]   I think that, again, all these viruses that shut down subways and hospitals and businesses
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.920]   all over Russia and Europe and even possibly coffee shops here, those were all NSA hack
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.280]   tools that got out into the open.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   And then they're used against us.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.120]   And if you want to see how bad it can get, you can look at those hacks and see what
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.040]   happens after the show.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.440]   Steve keeps in security now and it's coming up.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.280]   Because last week he asserted something, and I needed to get clarity on what he was
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   saying.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   But he said he did believe maybe it isn't for this phone, but in future, there'd be
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.600]   possible for Apple to unlock an individual phone without risking compromise of other
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   phones.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.760]   That it's possible that Apple, I think the idea would be Apple could push a firmware
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:57.360]   update to that one phone that would release the key that's stored on that phone in order
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.680]   to unencrypt the data on that phone.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:06.120]   And that technique, while it could later be applied to other phones, wouldn't necessarily
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.000]   provide a tool that would unlock other phones.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.840]   But of course, Apple's concern would not merely be that it would leak out hackers would get
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.680]   it, but that China would come to it.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.920]   Or some other country would go, or Erdogan would come to them and say, "Hey, by the way,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.280]   I know you have this tool now.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   Would you please unlock this?"
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.720]   I think the United States and the least in the worries.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   It's the other countries that as soon as they open that door, and I think that Apple
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.440]   is, they're not trying to build any back.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   So there's two problems.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   There's two problems.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.000]   One is, one is the problem that there would be a tool that would unencrypt phones that
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   would leak to bad guys.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.760]   So the other is that they would show an ability that they don't want to show foreign governments
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   to...
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   And I think that every time...
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   ...the individual phone.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.360]   I think every time they find an ability, they find a way to code it out of the system.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   I mean, I think that Apple's not...
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.840]   I think they are actively...
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.000]   Every OS update that we're getting is closing gaps.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.920]   And I think that the problem is they have to rush down that path because eventually they
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.600]   may end up with a government that says you have to do X, Y, and Z, but it's already out.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.520]   Every time Apple already releases it, it becomes harder and harder for a government
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.520]   to ask for it.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.720]   So I think that that's a huge push for them is to just keep on driving out every...
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.080]   Every access that they would have.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.440]   It's also our governments too have been caught doing things that aren't exactly legal or
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.120]   hiding all sorts of requests under FISA and similar...
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.680]   But then I understand why the deputy director of the FBI, Rod Rosenstein, would say Apple
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.560]   is working actively working against us.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.960]   They're actively trying to make the data inaccessible to us and we can...
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.480]   He said it's actually going to cost lives.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.480]   And I can understand...
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.440]   I mean, putting my FBI deputy director hat on, I can see why that would be upsetting.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.360]   Because they are going to look like that.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.920]   They're actively working to make it impossible.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:52.800]   Well, the thing that we grownups have to acknowledge is that yes, it is going to cost
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   lives.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.520]   The ability of bad people to have communications beyond the eyes of any oversight, seeing agency,
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.040]   that is going to cost lives.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.280]   But that's the same reason why, again, having the Fourth Amendment is going to cost lives.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.160]   Having the First Amendment is going to cost lives.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.240]   We just make a decision as a society that there is an amount of reasonable risk we're
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.760]   willing to undergo in order to protect a larger freedom.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.400]   This is why the rule of law is not well, if you've got nothing to hide, then why can't
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.400]   we see it?
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400]   That's not the rule of law.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   The rule of law is that if you have personal information, the government has to go through
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.720]   hoops in order to force you to give that information up.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.120]   But the big difference in this generation is that they have never, ever, ever been confronted
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:41.280]   by technology that is almost as effective as writing something down on a piece of paper
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.200]   and throwing it into a fire.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.480]   That's what this level of encryption is like.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.960]   Once law enforcement is faced with that, that someone can have useful information that cannot
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.360]   possibly be broken out of a safe or decrypted on their own.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.160]   Now you've got to, well, we didn't have to fight for this right for law enforcement to
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.800]   have the right to access any piece of information being transacted anywhere in the country.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.200]   But now we feel as though we have to ask for that right.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.600]   And it's up to us as citizens to say, no, you do not have that right.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.680]   It sounds like science fiction, but to take it a step further, we'll be at a point to
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.080]   in where we have machine learning predicting crimes and we'll have implants that are deeply
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080]   connected to us.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.040]   And eventually the brains are just electrical data.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.720]   We'll be able to read stuff on there.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.160]   And we've up until now considered thought to be sacrosanct.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.960]   And you could argue that a smartphone is the closest thing we have right now to actual
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.400]   bionics, where it's an extension of our brain and it retains information that we're
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.320]   just no longer capable of retaining by contacts and all these different things.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.840]   And how far does our right against self-incrimination go?
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.120]   Should this be considered privileged and not acceptable?
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.560]   And to Andy's point, as a society, we're going to have to start grappling with all
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.880]   these roles, it's not just minority report.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.760]   I was joking around with my God, the other day saying, "Do you want to watch Nightrider?"
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   He said, "What is it?"
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   I said, "It's a car that talks."
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.640]   Like Siri, "No, it drives itself like Tesla."
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.600]   And Mike Halden is his reality.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:05.680]   And very soon, all those science fiction movies about very intrusive government surveillance
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.920]   and a biological level are going to be true.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.040]   And it would be hoover to figure it out.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.560]   A lot of the government surveillance is already available.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.600]   I mean, they're pretty good at what they do.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.280]   So I think that we need to understand that the thing that is probably more valuable to
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.040]   the government that we did turn off was metadata.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:31.400]   Being able to mass collect metadata even when you don't need it is probably way more valuable
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.880]   than anything on a phone.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.880]   Because it means that you can go back in time and see someone become a terrorist.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.960]   That is before someone told them to strip their phone, because you can interconnect
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   all of that.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:48.120]   Who were they talking to when they got the new phone, that kind of thing?
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.880]   That is the stuff that is much more valuable.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880]   That was the conclusion.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.280]   I remember the, was it an MIT study called Going Dark?
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.000]   That was the conclusion.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.600]   A lot of experts, a lot of law enforcement, but security experts got together to write
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   this paper.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.360]   It said, "The means, the abilities for law enforcement to collect data has improved at
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.160]   a greater rate than the means to high data.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.480]   And in fact, law enforcement has more than ample data.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.080]   The concern about Going Dark is overstated."
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080]   It's hard.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.320]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320]   We're going to take a break.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:32.120]   Come back, talk about lots more, including Apple's geniuses who are straining under the
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.600]   load of iPhone's success.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.360]   It's a burden for them.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   What Apple's doing about it, including opening the new store, we got to make a field trip
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.120]   down a Berlin game, see that new Apple store within the new look, Apple store.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.280]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the ridiculously easy cloud accounting software
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.600]   that's used by over 10 million people.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.520]   I used it for years.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.360]   It started for me in making invoices.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.280]   That's really kind of the first step into the FreshBooks universe.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.240]   It makes it very easy to create professional looking invoices that get you paid faster.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.080]   Because the longer you put off doing the invoice chore, the longer it's going to take to get
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080]   paid.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.960]   But also, because those invoices make it easy for your clients to pay, they tend to pay.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.040]   On average, 11 days faster.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.080]   Plus it turns out, if you're doing invoices, you're doing expense receipts, you're counting
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:30.400]   hours, you're actually doing a bunch of the work accounting needs without doing any accounting.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   So the FreshBooks and that new dashboard can tell you, are you making a profit?
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.040]   You could see you're spending your outstanding balances.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.280]   You get all those kind of in the process of doing invoices alone.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.800]   Plus FreshBooks invoices have all sorts of nice features like you can reward propped
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.680]   clients and encourage customer loyalty by adding discounts to recurring templates.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.040]   You can have recurring invoices.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.400]   You can have automated invoices.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.560]   You can have automated payment if your client agrees.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.160]   It's all in there.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.800]   With FreshBooks, of course, you can build for time by client, but also by project.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.480]   The FreshBooks app and the FreshBooks website have timers there.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.200]   You can assign services to projects, designate different rates for each service.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.760]   All you do, you press play, you track your time to the minute.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.560]   The time entries are sort of chronologically on the invoice.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.680]   Automatically, they're imported right in and you can even add future, unbuild time entries
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.080]   to your recurring templates so you don't miss a minute.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.960]   Of course, all your expenses are in there too.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:31.520]   You take a picture of the receipt with your app on the phone and it'll automatically
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.400]   put it in the invoice or keep track of it.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.160]   You can see the receipt attachments when you view invoices in the iOS app.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.680]   Employees can log into the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS, which makes it easy for them
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.120]   to help your business taking care of it wherever they are.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120]   I can go on and on.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.800]   I tell you what, go to freshbooks.com/macbreak and try it free for 30 days.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.800]   Great help, great support too from some of the best support people in the world.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.040]   I'm out there in beautiful Toronto.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.600]   It's no wonder FreshBooks was included in the Forbes Small Giants list for 2017.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.800]   I use it for a long time and I think you might want to try this.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.280]   It is incredible.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.160]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.240]   If you do me a favor, put Macbreak weekly in the How Did You Hear About Us section so
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.560]   that they know how you heard about it.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:24.320]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.360]   Apple Genius is straining under the iPhone's success.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.200]   It's true if you ever go into an Apple store.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.640]   It is so crowded in there.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:40.120]   I have two iPads that my kids locked themselves out of by trying to put the wrong code in.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.240]   I'm just like, "I always go, "Oh, I got to take that in and get it fixed."
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.560]   Then I'm just like, "I don't have time to wait in line for 45 minutes."
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.840]   One way to solve this, Apple's redesigning its stores, the Chicago store featured a massive
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.080]   revamp including bigger spaces with sweeping balconies and leather seating balls.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.760]   Have you been to the Chicago store?
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   No.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   I have been to the Chicago store.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   How are those leather balls?
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   They...
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   Comfy?
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   That was awesome.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.760]   It was...
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.280]   It's like Union Square, I think, right?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   The Chicago store is...
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280]   They have a grove.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   Amazing.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   But the grove, even the grove is changing.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.200]   I guess the new Burling Games store.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.000]   By the way, the best part, I mean, there's so many great things about the Chicago store,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.800]   but the monitor, the wall, I mean, we deal with LED wall.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   There's so many great things about the Chicago store.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:54.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.

[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:04.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:14.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.800]   I'm a fan of the Chicago store.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.800]   I've been wanting to pick it up.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.800]   It's the nicest, fidget spinner ever received.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.800]   It's beyond a fidget spinner.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:48.800]   Why do they have the suits on there?
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.800]   They have lots of different designs.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.800]   This is an Amazon.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.800]   There's something about it that's a mixture of comfort.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   It's just the right size and precision.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.800]   These are all magnets too, so you can pull them out.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.800]   If you want it to be a little looser,
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:13.800]   you pull a couple of these out.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.800]   Now I'll play with it.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.800]   It's got a different feel to it.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.800]   You could pull out the balls.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.800]   It's all magnetic.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.800]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.800]   The hook is deep.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.800]   Especially when you're thinking about it,
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.800]   for the person who's got everything,
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.800]   you want to get $100.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.800]   It's not the least expensive one,
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.800]   but you're all using Max.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.800]   I'm not a fidget spinner.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.800]   I have not fallen for the fidget spinner.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.800]   My kids have fidget spinner.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.800]   This one is at a whole different level.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.800]   Anyway, it's really slick.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.800]   Focus.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   Orbitals.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.800]   I know it's very analog for an Apple show,
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.800]   but it's --
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   Or is it fee?
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.800]   It would be fee, because it's a Greek word.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   They've got lots of little grooves in how they work.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.800]   They do.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.800]   These are nicely machined.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   I can see why it's expensive.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   When you feel it, it's not a --
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.800]   It's only a 7-pound Alex.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.800]   Exactly.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.800]   How much would you pay?
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.800]   You could get 7 of these for Alex.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:45.800]   You're pick of the week.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.800]   Since we're talking about physics,
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.800]   I've used this as pick of the week before.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:51.800]   It's another quick plug for Fidgetopia,
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   because this is the holiday buying season.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   Oh, my God.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   Another one.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.800]   This is the Big Kahuna Chainmail Vote Vortex.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   It's like a stack of steel rings,
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   and a really tight little vortex.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800]   You can just sort of roll them --
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.800]   Pick one ring at a time on top of the other,
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800]   like that.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   It really is like Captain Quig of his ball bearing
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   with the strawberries.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.800]   You're just holding your hand like this
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   and just sort of just --
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.800]   It's like a matching silly putty
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.800]   only made out of metal steel rings.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.800]   That's kind of what it's like.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   It looks like Claus' Bazer.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.800]   Yeah, it's pretty --
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   It's a very pretty thing just on my desk.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.800]   I just enjoy having this thing that makes me look interesting.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:40.800]   They also have --
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800]   My second --
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.800]   My travel one is the --
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   I don't know what they call it,
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.800]   but this is bike chain, but it is really nicely set up,
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.800]   where it's just --
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   It's like eight links here,
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   and it is like having like prayer beads
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.800]   that you can just sort of like roll around your finger.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   The Big Kahuna is --
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.800]   I think it's the most expensive one they make.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.800]   It's 25 bucks.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.800]   This one is 18 bucks.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.800]   And every time I buy something from them,
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.800]   there is a very nice handwritten note
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   and a couple of tootsie rolls.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.800]   So this is a very --
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.800]   This is a person --
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.800]   These are like handmade stuff.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.800]   This isn't like they comes off a boat from China either.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.800]   So you feel very, very happy supporting someone
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.800]   who is making some really, really cool things.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.800]   I like them a lot.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.800]   My actual pick of the week is I'm kind of lame,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.800]   but it's very, very timely.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.800]   We were talking about this earlier,
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.800]   even though I tended to talk about this.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.800]   A lot of people have bought Suvie cookers
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.800]   based on my recommendations.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.800]   And our recommendations were big fans of Suvie cookers,
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   those immersion water heaters.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.800]   And whenever I'm cooking Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.800]   I have completely moved away from --
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.800]   Let's roast an entire turkey and completely into --
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.800]   Let us buy a couple of, like, eight to ten pound,
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   like, trust up turkey breasts and Suvie them.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.800]   Definitely -- Your first year you try this,
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.800]   you definitely want to transition into this
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.800]   by doing a smaller roast bird.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.800]   And then on the side of that,
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.800]   you have a bonus -- a bonus Suvie breast
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.800]   because you don't want to go all in on a new thing
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.800]   for family Thanksgiving all in one year.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.800]   Also, you're going to realize that the hardest part of Suvie
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.800]   is not the cooking, which is very, very easy,
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.800]   not making it hot, most in flavorful,
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.800]   because you can hardly fail to do that.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   It's when you have to -- when your mother asks,
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   "So, how did you cook this?"
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.800]   Like, 350 degrees.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.800]   No, it was cooked at a -- 142 degrees.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.800]   What?
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   142 degrees.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.800]   You're serving turkey cooked at 142 degrees.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.800]   Are you trying to kill us?
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.800]   For two and a half hours, Mom.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   You're never -- you're never hosting --
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.800]   I knew I should have brought -- I told your father,
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.800]   "I should cook a turkey and bring it
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.800]   because you're going to screw this up."
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   But, yes.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.800]   At 2V, it really will change the way you do Thanksgiving.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.800]   I also do -- I also do mashed potatoes the day before,
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.800]   bag them up in the vacuum sealer,
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.800]   and then pop them in a Suvie just to heat them back up.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.800]   And that's one less thing to do on Thanksgiving day
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.800]   and they turn out perfect.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:02.800]   Even if you go to the store,
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:05.800]   you can buy the prepackaged mashed potatoes.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.800]   Again, just plop --
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.800]   put out of the package, put into a bag,
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.800]   put into the Suvie, boom.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   That's something taken care of.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   The overall thing I recommend is that
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:21.800]   just forget all about the cartoon TV movie style Thanksgiving
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   that you've been forced fed,
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   that you're supposed to have a beautiful golden brown
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   cartoonishly shaped turkey that you present at the table and carve.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   It's like, no.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   You're there to achieve a result,
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:37.800]   to produce a really good meal involving turkey,
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.800]   green beans, smashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   And you can articulate those five ideas however you'd like.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.800]   But so long as you get those five things on the table
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.800]   and maybe one selection between red and white wine
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.800]   and sodas for the kids, you're golden.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.800]   However -- so don't invite all kinds of stress
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.800]   onto your life because you must roast the turkey
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.800]   and you must be all intact when you bring it to the table
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.800]   and you must do the beans this way.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:06.800]   Again, boiling water is usually the easiest way
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.800]   to cook a turkey, I find.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.800]   There you have it.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800]   And actually, I should mention -- you -- you -- I don't think it was many years ago --
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.800]   mentioned this Suvie -- a ridiculously expensive Suvie cooker,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.800]   the mellow mine, finally came.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.800]   And actually, I will demonstrate it.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.800]   You'll see it Saturday at work in the new "Screen Savers" show.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   And they are offering $100 off.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.800]   For a black Friday, which means it's only a ridiculous $199 --
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.800]   I'm sorry, $199 instead of $399.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.800]   Is this better than deep frying the turkey?
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.800]   That's my only -- no.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   I'm just saying no.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.800]   But it is the best way to make soft boiled eggs you've ever had.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.800]   And what I really like about it is this is a Suvie device that chills and heats.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   So one of the biggest problems with Suvie is it's ours.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.800]   Like that turkey recipe that you mentioned from "Serious Eats" --
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   Kenji Altlopes, who's great -- takes two and a half hours of Suvieting time.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.800]   So if you're at work and you have to come home at five and you don't eat dinner until eight,
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   you may not be super happy.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.800]   But the mellow, you put it in when you leave, it keeps it cold, you say,
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.800]   "This was the greatest thing.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800]   I put two steaks in."
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800]   And it says, "Well, how well you want them cooked?"
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.800]   And you get to choose how thick are the steaks.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.800]   You get to choose.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   And then it says, "Doesn't it say what temperature?
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   It doesn't say what time."
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.800]   It just says, "And when would you like to eat?"
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.800]   And you say, "6 p.m." and says, "Good, we'll handle it from here."
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   It chills it until whatever it is an hour and a half before dinner time.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   And then it cooks it.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   And it's ready.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   And it's all on your smartphone, your iPhone.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.800]   I admit they're expensive at 300 bucks because really, frankly, the ANOVA,
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.800]   which will probably be on Black Friday's sale at about 100 bucks --
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   It works perfectly well.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.800]   But this is going to say --
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.800]   Kind of cool.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.800]   It's already on sale at Amazon for $93.94.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.800]   That's when I bought my ANOVA.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.800]   And I use both.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:43:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.800]   But there's some things that are really cool about this.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.800]   For instance, salmon.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   You know, it'll keep it chilled.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   You wouldn't want to leave it in a sous vide bath and turn on the --
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.800]   I mean, this is the way to do it.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.800]   I've often thought that they need to make a really small one, just for eggs.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.800]   Like, I --
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:15.800]   This is the best --
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:16.800]   One of the first things I did.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   And the eggs you don't need to put in a vacuum bag.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.800]   You just drop them in.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.800]   You just drop them in.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.800]   Well, you'll see on Saturday, I made soft boiled eggs.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.800]   I make them often now.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:25.800]   They're just so perfect.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.800]   You remember those little martini glasses that I have?
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   The little ones I --
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.800]   You put a egg in there and put a little salt on it?
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.800]   Love it.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.800]   A little --
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.800]   A little black truffle salt that we talked earlier.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.800]   Watch on the Saturday because I also --
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:41.800]   We taped it already because nobody wanted to work on Thanksgiving.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   But I brought my childhood egg cup that I used to eat some of your legs in.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.800]   Oh, nice.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   There's one left.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.800]   And I brought it and Megan vouched for it.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.800]   And on this, you get to choose between --
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.800]   How do you want the creamy, velvety, husterty?
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800]   You get to choose.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.800]   This is an expensive shoe.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   No, buy it.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.800]   Don't buy it.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   I'm telling you, it's too expensive, but it sure is great.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.800]   But it's beautiful.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   It has a little --
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   It's a little --
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.800]   It has a scale built-in, so when you put something in, it goes, "Oh, you put something in.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.800]   What is it?
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.800]   What would you like me to do with it?"
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   Right.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:15.800]   No.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   If they were any closer to the future --
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.800]   No, I will accept the blame because if this were any closer to the future that we imagined
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.800]   when we were kids, it would -- there would be like --
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   All it's missing are like two cartoon, like robot arms with big white gloves.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   Yes.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.800]   But like take the egg and crack it like this and then put them back into a drawer.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.800]   Like, while I'm sitting around that drawer.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   Yes.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.800]   It's actually really fun.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   I haven't tried the microwave burrito in it yet, although Andy tells me it's very good.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   It's -- I had -- I had frozen -- it's how I cook like frozen -- I do have some convenience
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.360]   but I try not to -- I have to have them in the fridge just in case.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:58.160]   But I have a general child's chicken like frozen up and instead of like putting with
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.120]   a microwave or whatever, again, you just sous vide them and if they come up, everything that
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.640]   does not have to be crisp is almost always going to be perfect.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.600]   And the great thing about the mellow is that I find that for me, I just -- it's not so
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.080]   much the cooking time and the preparation time that gets me.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.480]   It's the fact that I owe -- that before sous vide, I would have to do all the cooking right
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:19.000]   before I eat.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.160]   And the last thing I wanted -- and I would much rather just sort of like show up for dinner
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.640]   and find that someone has already done the cooking for me.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.200]   And that's pretty much what sous vide is like.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:30.160]   You still have a -- for a lot of these things, you'll want to brown them in some way and
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.640]   I had some suggestions for that.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   They're not closing it.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   I find it interesting that they're not closing it.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.640]   Well, yeah, that's weird.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.280]   They provide you with Ziploc bags that you could do.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.160]   But you know, I have the -- this is another product.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.160]   If you really want to go crazy, the VACMaster.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.840]   VP219, baby.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:48.400]   It's the Mac truck of vacuum sealers.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.280]   All my money.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   It's more than money.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280]   I saw that.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280]   Okay.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.840]   I admit, I didn't know I had any limits.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.240]   And I saw the VACMaster and I went, "Oh, I need to get one."
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:02.240]   I looked at a little more like, "I'm going to knock it."
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.880]   I'm actually step away from the credit card.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.520]   You know, this was -- you can come over and you can use it.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.520]   Come over.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.520]   You can use it.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.520]   It's only a $1,000.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.520]   But is it great?
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.520]   Here's what it is.
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:19.280]   It's like an iPhone for that.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.080]   You mentioned that, "Oh, I've also bought a VACM sealer."
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.040]   And I'm thinking, "Oh, that one of those really cool $60 food sealers I got."
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   I was like, "Oh, my God.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.120]   He bought the one that's in the chopped kitchen."
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.840]   But it's amazing, isn't it?
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.840]   So, yeah.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:35.840]   So, yeah.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.880]   And you get the special bags and you put it in.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.160]   And what it is is it's a chamber sealers.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.160]   It's a chamber vacuum.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.800]   So, it's kind of like, you know, it's chemistry.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.960]   You put it in there.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.040]   You close the lid and you don't have to hold the lid down because immediately it creates
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.400]   enough of a vacuum to the lid seal.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.000]   You couldn't open it if you wanted to.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.800]   And it goes, "For a minute, sucks all the air out of it."
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.440]   And the best parts are the sounds.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:00.800]   And then at the end of it, it goes, "Boom!"
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.280]   And the lid opens because there's no more vacuum and it's done and it's perfectly sealed.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   And it's actually great for a --
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.280]   You have a roll of --
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.760]   No, I didn't.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.960]   You can get individual bags.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.960]   I just get it.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:11.960]   You can seal the bags.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.720]   It has a heat sealer.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.880]   So there's a -- so the lip of the bag goes on a bar that will get hot after it sucks
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   all the air out.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.720]   Then it puts the -- then it seals the bag.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:27.160]   And for freezing stuff for cheap -- like I get big chunks of cheese and cut it up and
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.760]   put it in the fridge.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.760]   Because there's no oxygen.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.760]   It doesn't -- it lasts forever.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.760]   It lasts forever.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.760]   You seal up leftovers.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.840]   They've lost several weeks or days.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.440]   I buy fresh meat that never go into the freezer but it will last a few weeks or days.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.040]   And for me, because again, I want someone -- I don't want to cook meals.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.640]   I want someone else to cook meals and then serve it to me.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.160]   But I can't hire somebody to do that for me.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.840]   So like if I'm home all Sunday, it will be --
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840]   No, I don't want to go over you.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.440]   It will be just like my grandma's house.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.200]   Like at my place every Sunday because I've got a couple of pots of like beans and rice
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.200]   going.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.520]   I've got some pasta going.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.040]   I've got some -- some steaks going so that by two or three o'clock I will have one really
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.680]   good meal on the day.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.800]   But then I will have vacuum sealed like almost the equivalent of like five lean cuisines
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.880]   of homemade food of things that are already cooked and vacuum sealed in bags.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.880]   I'll have to do with a few food.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:17.880]   So awesome.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:19.880]   Still frozen.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.880]   You know what I do?
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.920]   I'll sous vide it first, then put it in the fridge and it's still good a couple of days
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:25.240]   later or freeze it.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.360]   So it's already been sous vide it.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.000]   And then you could sear it or whatever.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000]   And I got --
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]   I don't know the other thing I got.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.720]   It'll go into the sous vide twice.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:37.320]   Oh no, you got the -- you got the seers all.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.320]   You got the seers all.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.320]   I have a seers all.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.320]   That's not so expensive.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.000]   I got a solaire grill.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.600]   So the solaire grill is like a giant seers all.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.000]   So the idea of the seers all is that you have a butane torch like brazing torch the
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.480]   plumbers would use.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:55.520]   And then you have on touch to it the seers all device which heats up a metal plate and
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.240]   you're cooking it, you're searing it with radiant heat instead of flame.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.440]   Well that's how this grill works.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:08.960]   It's a gas grill but instead of flame it heats up ceramic plates to a thousand degrees.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.760]   Then you take your sous vide turkey or chicken or steak.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.720]   You put it in there for one minute.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.640]   It's like done.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.120]   And it's perfectly seared.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.280]   And inside or outside?
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.280]   There's a portable one.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.280]   They have them inside.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   They have them outside.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280]   There's desktop.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.440]   I got one that looks just like a gas grill basically but you can get all, you know, a
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440]   cartman.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.960]   Looking for an electric one that'll do that.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.680]   You need the gas and this just uses propane tanks.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.640]   Although you can, you know, plummet to your natural gas if you wanted to make it part
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   of your kitchen.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640]   Right.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.200]   Oh, they have solar infrared gas.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200]   Oh, infrared.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.200]   This is all infrared.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]   But it's still a gas grill.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.480]   It's a because you can't like electricity wouldn't heat it up fast enough.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.480]   But the gas does.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:55.480]   You know, three minutes, it takes three minutes to get it to a thousand degrees.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:57.480]   It takes a minute to cook the steak on each side.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.280]   Yeah, my grill five minutes later.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   The grill.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280]   My house gets about 650 degrees.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.280]   And that's not quite.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.280]   No, this is a thousand.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.280]   I'm telling you, come over.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.280]   Come over.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.280]   We'll vac master.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.280]   We'll solar.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280]   By the way, I did not.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:11.280]   We all going to be very experienced.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.280]   We're the vac master in the new screen.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.280]   The brother's right.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.280]   I brought the secret.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.280]   My wife would be like, there is already a grill built in.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.960]   Well, I have a big green egg too.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:20.960]   I know.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:21.960]   And I have to say, we did it.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:22.960]   We did.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.960]   We did.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.720]   We did ribeyes and the big green eggs better because you get that smoky flavor.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.720]   But you have to, you know, put coal and fire it up and I still use the big green for the
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.240]   well, I love the big green.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.240]   Big red chicken.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.880]   Yeah, that's the like it.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.880]   Big red chicken.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:36.880]   Can't really.
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.720]   I just realized how easy it is to cook an entire meal using techniques that my mother,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.720]   none of which my mother would.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:42.720]   Isn't it interesting?
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.720]   Recognize.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.000]   See, the rule is for me when I buy something is like, this is going to be a conversation
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000]   piece when my friends come up.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.040]   You're like, like, it's not just that I want to cut it up.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.200]   It's like that we're going to talk about it.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.000]   I will next with it.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.320]   Just bring in an audio recording of the vac master.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.040]   It's extremely satisfying.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.760]   I don't know if there are covers or bucks satisfying, but it's extremely satisfying.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.760]   Anybody has a deer they want to cut up or whatever.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:08.760]   I got the vac master.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:09.760]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.960]   It's probably what they use on those.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.480]   It does make a difference that when the vacuum sealings easy, like I have a cheaper.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.120]   I have a cheap little vacuum sealer.
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:18.800]   I had an industrial one and I lost it in some movies.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.040]   I buy the bags 1000 at a time.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.200]   You know, and then you just do a whole bunch of them and you get everything out.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.480]   Like it's like a Saturday morning, you put a whole bunch of stuff in the freezer.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.320]   Like I buy whole full laminones that like perfect and then you cut them all up and it's
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.840]   so much cheaper that way.
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840]   Absolutely.
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.280]   And then you put the different things in them and you write on the outside.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.440]   I put this on it and I use this salt and then I did, you know, whatever and then you throw
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.200]   them into the freezer and then you're good to go.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.200]   Now I'm hungry.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.200]   I'm hungry.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.200]   Thank you everybody.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:52.640]   We do Mac break and sous vide weekly every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:53.640]   1800.
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:55.720]   We're using sous vide yet.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.920]   I have everything packed away right now, but I do have a sous vide.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.280]   Because you're the odd man out here.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:01.760]   You know, like, yes.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.760]   No, I do.
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:03.760]   No, I bought two of them.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:06.680]   Mine hasn't, my one Leo just described hasn't shipped yet, but I have the.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.880]   Oh, you bought the mellow.
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:08.880]   Wow.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.880]   Same day you did and you got us both.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.880]   Boom, boom.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   Quick succession.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.880]   Wow.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.960]   Well, and that's why for a long time I put off sous vide because if I'm getting the mellow,
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:18.840]   but after waiting for two years, I finally said I better get an A Nova.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.000]   You know, you know, it's next for you though.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   What centrifuge.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000]   I think.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000]   What can I do with that?
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.880]   I want to cook with the power.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:30.920]   You can you can you can extract the essence of things by spinning spinning them really,
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.920]   really.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.920]   Oh, I wouldn't mind a centrifuge.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.920]   I have a whole lab.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.680]   There's a whole lab in the pantry.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:37.680]   With all this stuff on there.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.000]   Just I got just to the rest of a dehydrator too.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.160]   There's nothing better.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.160]   You take a pineapple.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.160]   You dehydrate it.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.160]   You're like one of those.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:50.080]   You're like one of those music fans to stop listening to REM once they everyone started
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.080]   listening to REM.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.960]   So what's the next thing after?
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:59.000]   So I can not only did I stop listening to it, I used to be the music director for alternative
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000]   rock station.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.640]   Like it was my job to know what was coming up next beef team gives the solar a thumbs
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:09.920]   up beef team is actually works at I think it's Purdue right in he's in the agriculture
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.440]   agriculture department there teaching people how to make better beef.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:15.280]   Yes, he knows what I'm talking about.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:16.680]   He says solar is good.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for being here.
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:20.560]   We will be back next week.

[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:47.240]   He also does a material Android podcast on relay.fm.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.440]   It's all about bringing down the state from within.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.440]   Don't tell anybody.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:51.440]   Shh.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.240]   And now that Renee's using the Pixel 2 XL, maybe we can get him to do a Android podcast.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.360]   You should get him on material.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.720]   I'm more.com where he covers all the great stuff, including Pokemon go and Apple and
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.520]   Mac and all that stuff and probably fidget's as well.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:10.280]   You can also hear his great podcasts at every doing a daily show.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.680]   Now Leo God help me.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.600]   What vector every day?
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.040]   Oh my I didn't realize vector was daily.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.680]   No, I brought it back and now it's like today we have Dan DeSilva.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.680]   More we have Don Melton.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.320]   The next day we have the analyst.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.320]   And Dawson.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.480]   I mean, it's just you can't not do it.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:26.480]   We'll see if I live.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.480]   We'll see if I live.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.920]   And of course Alex Lindsey, he's the Pixel core.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:36.600]   Best thing to do with Alex here is follow him at Alex Lindsey, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y on the Twitter
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.840]   because he'll announce whatever's going on.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.840]   Open for memberships.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.840]   No, we're not open for memberships.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.040]   We're looking really closely at Patreon because they've added a whole bunch of that.
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.040]   That's a good way to do it.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.800]   Yeah, it's just a better way to do it.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:52.960]   There was a bunch of things that were missing from Patreon.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:55.800]   And then they added most of those in and an API.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.120]   And so now we kind of feel like that's a better solution for us.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.880]   And so we're trying to work through that right now.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.480]   I'm going to be in Delhi next week.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:11.640]   So if you're from Delhi, and if you see a chicken tikka, if you see a chicken tikka
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.320]   masala maker, you know, they don't, you know, that's an English dish.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.320]   What?
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.320]   They don't make it in India.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:19.120]   I think you might be able to bring it.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.040]   It's not an Indian dish.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.040]   That's a London dish.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:24.040]   That's why.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.040]   Oh, it's butter chicken.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040]   Butter chicken.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:27.040]   None of that's Indian.
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.040]   Oh, bring me some.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.040]   What's the Chinese food?
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.680]   I actually can't eat Indian food very well.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.680]   Not from India.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.720]   I work in India occasionally and I can't process it.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.480]   Like I just, it's the oils or the spices or something.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:38.480]   The key.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:39.480]   It's the key.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.480]   I love the key.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   I make my own key.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.480]   The key is a very useful thing.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.480]   You got to have clarified butter if you're cooking.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.480]   I don't know.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.480]   I don't think that's it.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   Anyway, I don't know what it is, but I can't.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   Well, have fun in Delhi.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]   I will.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.480]   That sounds awesome.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.760]   The pollution index is a little high right now.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:52.760]   I'll be working.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:53.760]   That's right.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.760]   Delhi's the one that's going down.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.760]   It's going down.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.640]   It's going down, but like you track it when you're going and I was like, I was like,
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:00.640]   it was, I thought I was looking at the wrong chart.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.080]   Like I was like, it was like 600 and it's off the books.
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:05.000]   It's like 650 and I was like 650.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.240]   Isn't that the one that's supposed to not go above 50?
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.240]   It's getting down.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.600]   I've now down to 300 and something.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:11.600]   It's like down.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:12.600]   It's okay.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.480]   I spent like a week and a half there and was wearing one of those like air face masks.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.480]   And when he got home, he was able to like take that mask to a metal recycler and made
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.480]   enough money back.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.120]   It was loaded with silver.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:27.120]   Do you wear a.
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:28.120]   A.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.120]   Reaser.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.280]   It hasn't been this bad before.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:32.640]   So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not going to spend much time outside.
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.640]   I'm working.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:34.640]   So it's not like I'm a sightseeing.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:36.760]   I'm going to be in buildings all the time.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:37.760]   All right.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.760]   Well, have a great trip.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:39.760]   But it's an excellent.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.760]   But I'm probably going to try to do some kind of get together.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:41.760]   In Delhi.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:42.760]   So, so I'm in.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.920]   Is it New Delhi or old Delhi?
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   It's new.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920]   I don't know.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.920]   It's Delhi.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.280]   I don't understand the whole thing.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.560]   And I say Mumbai and then my Indian partner says, that's just Bombay.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.280]   We call it Bombay here in India.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.280]   So confusing.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.000]   So anyway, I'll say hi to Modi for me.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.720]   We'll see you next time.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:04.480]   But now I'm sorry to say it's time to get back to work because guess what?
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:05.480]   Break time is.
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:12.480]   And then I'll say, that's the way that we're going to be.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.200]   We're going to be in India.
