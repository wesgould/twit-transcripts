[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240]   Hey, everybody.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   We're here for a Mac Break Weekly, episode 148.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.080]   I know I sound like a kind of a nasally, slightly different
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.720]   version of Leo.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.240]   That's because you're not listening to Leo, of course.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.560]   This is Alex.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.720]   Leo is in China.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.200]   He is posting great stuff on Twitter and friend feed.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   And you should check that out.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000]   But Scott and I are going to actually be holding the show.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.680]   Scott, hey, how's it going?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.040]   The kids are running the asylum.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   What can we do?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.440]   We're gone.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   What can we do?
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.320]   This is where my-- this harkens back to episode 4,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.080]   when it was just me and you.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.040]   And I think it was my first time.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   And it was just amazingly fun.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   We could just control the universe.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.920]   Exactly.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   Andy was not able to make it today.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.200]   He was planning to make it.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.720]   And then he has to leave for China tomorrow.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.600]   And so he is a little overwhelmed.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.280]   So anyway, so there will probably be Leo, Noe Andy.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800]   It's going to be an interesting show.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.480]   Hey, come on.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.680]   Half the cast is here.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   What do you mean?
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700]   Exactly.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.200]   Exactly.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   We'll be half as good as we usually are.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.880]   So there's a couple interesting things in the news.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.040]   We've got AT&T--
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   I don't think we talked about this last week.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960]   I think it came out after that.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   AT&T reported.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.440]   It's best sales ever.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.120]   Duh.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.480]   But you don't think about-- I think that it was--
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.140]   I thought that that was unusual only
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080]   because you would have thought the initial launch would be
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.520]   the best sale.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.120]   Oftentimes you think, well, when everyone
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.080]   was buying it for the first time,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.880]   this is the best sale for the iPhone 3GS.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.480]   And what I'm guessing is also the--
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.120]   it also has to do with the new iPhone that's $99, right?
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.960]   Obviously, there's a lot of heat on the $99 iPhone.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.880]   In fact, I was in San Francisco last week.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.920]   And I had very little time.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.120]   I did drop into the flagship Apple store there at Fourth
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.400]   in Stockton.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   And they had a special line.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.280]   And I said, well, you know, like the phone has been out
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.840]   of week, what's this line for?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.280]   They said that was the $99 iPhone line.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800]   You had to stand outside the store
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.200]   in a special line for the $99 iPhone.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.240]   The store was full of people.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.600]   They were buying other stuff.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   But they had a special line for the $99 iPhone.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.520]   So that told me that that was pretty hot.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.560]   And I'm not surprised to see that AT&T
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.760]   is having a great time, because let's face it,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.320]   Apple sold a million phones the first weekend, which
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.800]   is more than they sold the first time around.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.440]   Right, right.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.320]   And I think that the $99 version is just
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.880]   going to make such a huge difference.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200]   It is going to be pretty amazing.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.800]   I mean, I know that now I'm thinking about getting it
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.480]   for my parents.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   And I bought my parents a--
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.560]   I got them some iPods, as I talked about earlier.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   And they're crazy about them.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.160]   I think they've--
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.600]   you know, the thing is, they really
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   should give these away.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.960]   I mean, we talk about this a lot.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   They should just give the stuff away,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.720]   because my parents spent so much money on the iTunes store.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.760]   When my dad was finding his favorites from the '50s and '60s.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.680]   And now I'm slowly getting ready to move them
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.600]   into the next generation of that into a full iPhone.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.200]   I showed one of my relatives the 3GS
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.160]   with the level application from the iTunes app store.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.920]   It turns the iPhone into a level.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.480]   And he just-- he went on for about an hour about that.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.800]   He was walking around checking the level of all the things
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.960]   in the house.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   And he never showed any interest in technology before.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.840]   So yeah, I did hear from two or three friends
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.000]   who were very excited that they could buy the iPhone now,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.360]   because the price was a problem for them in the past.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.120]   $99 bucks.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.040]   They didn't care that they weren't getting the 3GS.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   The 3.0 software is a lot of the upgrade.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.120]   So yeah, that's pretty big.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.560]   I have reports that the iPhones are out of stock in Great Britain,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.800]   only for pre-order.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.840]   I've heard other cities having trouble.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   Have we checked our little iPhone in stock list lately, Alex?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.720]   I don't think we've checked it.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.000]   I know that there were some reports
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   that it is the interesting thing about the availability.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.920]   Isn't just the-- sorry, we have a couple--
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.880]   the switcher isn't quite set up the way it was the last time
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.120]   someone was around with it.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.160]   Just pointed that chair by the books,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.280]   because that's the chair I want to be in.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.800]   Just imagine it's got--
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.760]   Just imagine me sitting there doing my Alistair Cook
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.360]   imitation.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.440]   So no, we-- it's a slightly different setup
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   than the last time I was here.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.800]   So I'm just trying to figure out which one is which here.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.000]   OK, so anyway, the other thing that's
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.480]   interesting, though, is that it's not just
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   that the iPhone is running out of stock.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.000]   And the other thing that's interesting
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   is that the 13 inches running out of stock,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.280]   the base model of the MacBook Pro,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.880]   is starting to run out of stock in a variety
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.920]   of different places, which I think is--
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.080]   a lot of people weren't sure how well it would do.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.760]   We bought one.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.240]   Yeah, it's really interesting that the Apple Store continues
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.560]   to just sell tons of stuff.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.480]   We got a terrible economy.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.800]   Everybody else is going out of business.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.320]   And Apple can't make enough stuff.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.640]   So I hate to say this, but it's--
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.920]   the thing I've been hearing a lot lately from some people,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.160]   I didn't coin this, but I've been repeating it
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.560]   because I think it's true.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.480]   It's not the economy.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.120]   It's just that you suck.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.520]   Well, I mean, I don't know if--
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.040]   I think that the issue is that Apple--
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.600]   I think that there's a big advantage
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.840]   of having a niche that Apple's fulfilling
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.200]   in a certain number of people.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.400]   I think follow that niche.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.520]   And I think the people who are using Macs oftentimes
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   are less price sensitive than people who aren't.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.280]   And I think that sometimes that affects it.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.320]   Although, I think that part of this situation
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.880]   is I think the 13-inch fulfilled important niche, which
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.440]   is that people wanted Firewire.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   They wanted to have a little bit more graphics power.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.560]   They wanted to have all those little extras,
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.520]   but they didn't want to pay for the 15-inch and the 17-inch.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.240]   That was more than they needed.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.480]   And does that have the Express Card bus, Alex?
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.800]   Isn't that a problem for you?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.200]   So I'm about to eat some crow.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.080]   I didn't want to bring that up, but you know.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.920]   I don't like to do it.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.480]   I don't like crow that much.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.880]   I like chicken, maybe some duck.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.920]   So here's the thing I have to say about the whole issue
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.360]   that I had.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   So when the 13-inch came out, I Twittered somewhat roughly.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.080]   There's the-- we'll just say rough.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.760]   So I tweeted a little-- I was a little rough.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.720]   I was like, oh, this stinks.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.360]   And I'm never going to buy a 15-inch.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.880]   This is all crap.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.440]   And I was very upset about the whole thing.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   And I'm afraid that I got a lot of correction on Twitter,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.040]   which is what often happens, is that I'm crazy on Twitter.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.600]   And then I get lots of responses, and then people
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   put me in my place.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.880]   And a couple things that came up-- number one
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.160]   was a lot of suggestion.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.880]   As we started looking at what would our existence look
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.800]   like without an Express Card, we realized
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.120]   that we are moving actually away from using the Express
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.600]   Card as much as we thought we would
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.160]   and moving more to Firewall 800 for a lot of the stuff.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.320]   Yeah, I mean, some of the stuff we were using for the Express
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.200]   Card were, for instance, reading Sony's S by S cards, which
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.400]   is from these cameras that we use.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.200]   And that's the number one reason we use it.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.040]   The other reason is being able to interface with the I/O Express.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.360]   And what's interesting is we already
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.320]   had a discussion about-- when we started having an discussion
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.880]   about the I/O Express, A.J.A.'s interface.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.320]   And we actually were talking about the fact
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.000]   that we really want to have the 17-inch for the studio.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.440]   I mean, like when we're on set, we actually
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.640]   want the larger screen because we're previewing stuff.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   And it's over actually using that box,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   having the larger machine make sense.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   We're using a lot more SD cards.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.280]   And that's what it has.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.640]   So from what cameras, Alex?
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.760]   These are-- in the office, we have two EX-1s.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.040]   And we have two EX-1s and an EX-3.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.520]   Those are--
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.480]   And they both--
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.960]   And those are according to SD?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.680]   Those all record-- well, kind of.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.000]   And they record to what's called S by S cards, which
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.080]   are painfully expensive.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.920]   16 gigs is like $800 or $1,000 or something.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's just insane.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.880]   But there's a little Australian company
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.640]   called E-film that makes what they call M by R cards, which
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.800]   are they record to SD cards.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.600]   They're an adapter for $50.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   So we ordered a bunch of them more testing them.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.840]   So we're moving most of that stuff to SD cards.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.200]   And what that means is that we're
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.920]   starting to back off on needing the S by S card.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:49.480]   The other complaint that I had that I was pretty vocal about
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.560]   was-- and I'm going to try to find my angle here.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.280]   I think I stuck it somewhere here.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.040]   The other complaint that I had here
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.840]   was that I--
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.760]   hold on one second.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.520]   Sorry.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.000]   The switcher suddenly just stopped working.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.080]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.480]   There we go.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.320]   That's a better view.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   Let's leave you big in the box.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.680]   You're the host.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.320]   Thanks.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.400]   Well, I'm just trying to figure out
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.360]   why the keys weren't working, but they're working now.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:24.720]   So anyway, so the issue is that the other question that I had
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.560]   was batteries.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.280]   So I have four batteries.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.160]   And I travel a lot.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.920]   And I want to make sure that I'm able to jump around.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.240]   And switch these batteries.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.920]   I'm on 10 hour flights, 15 hour flights.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.720]   This is like a big deal for me, is not
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.600]   to be able to have a removal battery.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.400]   I don't care how long Apple says it's going to last.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.600]   It's not going to work for me.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   I'm going to need more power to get through an entire flight.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.200]   And so that was my complaint.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.880]   And what actually showed up was someone--
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.920]   and I just-- I don't have it listed here.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.520]   I wasn't quite ready for this.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.880]   But there was a company that actually makes battery packs.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   You know, these little packets.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.800]   And maybe someone watching will post this here,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.600]   and I'll jump up to it.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.320]   But there's a battery pack that can last up to 27 hours.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.920]   And it just plugs into your power.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.440]   And I haven't gotten one yet.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.680]   I'm going to try to get one in the next couple weeks
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.480]   and test it.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.320]   So maybe it'll be a Mac break pick if it works.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.520]   But the main thing is, is that it'll last for a long time.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.640]   I can charge it separately.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.320]   It's actually a better solution than me carrying around
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.520]   all these stupid batteries.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   So--
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.400]   I thought maybe you had just taken my suggestion,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.120]   which is to buy two of the 13 inches.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.960]   That's the way I think you should handle it.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.440]   Because then you got twice the battery life.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.600]   That's true.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   That's true.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   And if I keep--
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.720]   well, Corey Doctorow, I think, actually has two computers
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.480]   that are identical.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.880]   And they're mirrored to each other.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   I remember him talking about that on a twit, where
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.680]   the computers are mirrored so that if either one goes down,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.240]   he can always swap out and be able to have
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.560]   an identical computer that he can work with,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   which I always thought was a good idea.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.880]   I never had the money to--
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.600]   So are the--
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   Wow.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.080]   I did the money to do that.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.760]   Are you talking about the HyperMac external Mac book
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.560]   power packing?
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.520]   Yes, that's it.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.040]   OK.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   So that's the HyperMac.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.120]   And it is--
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.680]   and it is-- they've got a bunch of different ones.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.600]   They've got a small one.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.480]   They've got a big one.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.560]   They've got a-- you know, there's a variety of different pieces
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.360]   there that you can charge.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.760]   It looks like they've got one that's roughly the size
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.320]   of an external C hard disk.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.040]   And I've been trying to figure out actually what the delay is,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.280]   is me trying to figure out which one--
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.840]   Yeah, which one is the right for me?
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.320]   And you want the biggest one, Alex.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.640]   Let's just get through with it, OK?
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.840]   How much power would we need as much as we can get, then some?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.880]   It's-- as I said, the thing about it is, is that it's--
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.600]   I'm worried about weight, too.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.120]   So that's the other piece here.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.280]   And I think I have it here.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.160]   There it is.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.920]   So here's the picture of these battery packs
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   if you're watching.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.080]   And these are-- so the idea of having that little one was
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.480]   exciting.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.120]   I think that the little one is too--
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.320]   the battery life isn't long enough.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.440]   But one of the medium ones.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.160]   I think the big one is just too big.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.600]   You know, I think that--
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.240]   and a lot of it also has to do with my bag.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.880]   You know, I use a-- I have a cotta bag
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.840]   and being able to put it in there and make sure
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.120]   that it's actually going to sit nicely.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.800]   I think that it's one of the two middle ones
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.840]   is what I'm really looking for.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.080]   You don't really need 27 hours for the battery life.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.320]   There-- that's a flight.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.920]   At the flight from New York to South Africa nonstop.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.040]   Well, I may not need--
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.240]   Wait for the flight.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.160]   I may not need it for the flight.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.200]   But if you've worked in Africa, you
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.080]   know that--
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.580]   Right.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.480]   --you need to go two or three days without power.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.920]   So the ability to be able to do that is important to me.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.400]   So anyway, so that's my-- so what happened
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.000]   was we needed to get a-- we actually
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.080]   needed a PC laptop to give to a presenter
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.280]   for a training that we're recording for one of our clients.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.360]   And so we didn't want to buy an actual PC.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   So we bought-- because we were going to end up
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.880]   with this machine.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.680]   And so we bought a Mac.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.920]   We bought the 13 inch.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.520]   I think we didn't buy the bottom line.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.280]   We bought the one with like four gigs or whatever.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   And you just turned parallel installed.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   Well, we just boot camped it.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.040]   We just installed it to make sure that it was totally
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.440]   what he would need and everything else.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.720]   And man, is it a nice little computer.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.920]   I mean, I was really-- all of our producers want that.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.040]   They don't want the MacBook.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.080]   They don't want the 15 inch.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   They don't want the 17 inch.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.720]   They want the 13 inch.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.160]   So--
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   I have to say that I'm very happy with the new 17 inch.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.680]   It's fast enough that I'm using it as my primary computer.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.040]   And it's really convenient because I
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.520]   don't have to worry about which computer, which stuff
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520]   is on anymore.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.800]   So I'm just using that as my primary computer.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.400]   I take it home.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   I take it on the road.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.320]   I'll leave it in my studio.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.920]   And I've always got the stuff I need.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.080]   And then thanks to that and a Drobo connected to a Pogo plug.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.280]   And I can access my files from pretty much anywhere
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.400]   in the world.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.960]   Yeah, I think that for a lot of what I do now,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.200]   I can get away with doing a--
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.400]   I can get away with my laptop.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.960]   I mean, that's what I'm on 90% of the time.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.600]   That was a transfer--
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.040]   That was a crazy stuff.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.360]   Is a transfer rate from those SD cards
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.160]   fast enough out of the Sony cameras for you
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.920]   to do the special stuff that you do?
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.440]   Well, all we got to do is pull them off.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.200]   I mean, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.160]   We're just pulling the data off of them.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.800]   We're not working with the data.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.280]   I see.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   So you're copying that data across to the computer first.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.320]   And then you're processing.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.840]   Yeah, because it's actually in some kind of crazy--
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.080]   it's in some kind of crazy format, what's called a BPAV.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.640]   And so then we have to take it into the Sony XD cam
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.400]   and have it converted to a quick time.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.160]   And currently.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.200]   And so it's a bit of a pain in the neck,
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.960]   but it's something that we'll solve soon.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.880]   And so you end up, especially when you're shooting a long event,
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.000]   like what we're shooting right now.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.600]   We have three cameras shooting for eight hours a day.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   And so you have-- you're just constantly sucking up
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   all of this data.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.960]   And you need to launch this card.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.880]   So you're covering the Michael Jackson event, then are you?
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.000]   We are not covering the--
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.960]   That is not our client.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.000]   They came to us and they said, can you
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.560]   throw a couple cameras out there, maybe do a little digital set,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.240]   and maybe a live.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.800]   I had to say the words Michael Jackson.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.120]   I couldn't help myself.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.480]   I think there's a bunch of channels actually playing
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.760]   in 24 hours right now.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.320]   Yeah, Mac, very quickly, we didn't want to be scooped.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.560]   We didn't want to be left out.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.720]   So that was it.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.520]   That was our official--
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.240]   You know it's live.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   You know it's live.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.960]   It's live right now at the same time we are.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.400]   Who do you think's going to draw more?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.120]   That's my big question.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.440]   No, did you see the news that Apple's--
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.120]   the App Store is one year old?
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.840]   I did see that news today.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.120]   And one year.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.160]   I can remember a year ago the various haters saying,
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.680]   that'll never work.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.520]   Well, you know, and it's interesting.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.640]   So they have over 50,000 applications,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   over a billion downloads.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.000]   It's doing OK.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.320]   You know, it's turning--
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.000]   And I think that-- I really do think that we're in a--
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.440]   I think that we're in a real turning point where--
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.840]   I still think that the possibility of the iPhone
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.120]   is just barely being--
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.200]   we're barely scratching the surface.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.240]   Well, I tell you what, last week's pick of the week by Leo,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.560]   Audiboo--
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.440]   --is a perfect example of what's available.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.520]   I mean, last night I had my computer tied up with something
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   else and all my ports were busy.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.880]   And I wanted to download Audiboo to the iPhone.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.160]   I just went to the App Store.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.240]   It magically appeared.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.800]   I'd already set up my Audiboo account earlier in the day.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   So that was a perfect example of how the App Store can play
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.520]   apart in getting you something when you need it direct to the phone.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   And then--
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.320]   I mean, let's just talk about Audiboo for a minute.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.120]   My gosh, have you tried it?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.520]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.040]   It will blow your mind, Alex.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.520]   The audio-- I'm sitting here using a very nice microphone.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.880]   It's the high LPR40.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.200]   That's top of the line, right?
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.280]   You know, we all agree that's one of the best mics around.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.240]   The audio coming out of the 3GS onto Audiboo is equal to this.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.480]   Wow.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.280]   It's stunningly clear.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.560]   It's amazingly easy to use.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.360]   I've already got a couple of post up.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.080]   Elio's got a bunch of post up from China.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.560]   That's just a perfect example.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   Here, this thing looks like a telephone.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   And now it's really a broadcasting device.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.160]   One of the--
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.760]   If you end up using one of the--
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.800]   if you start using one of the interfaces,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.360]   you know, you could even improve it even further
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.040]   than what it sounds like now.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.400]   If you listen to it--
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.480]   You don't need to.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.960]   I would ask you to tell me exactly how you would improve
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.320]   on that short of an optimod.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.800]   Right.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.320]   Right.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.080]   Unless you're going to run it through a $50,000
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.840]   vocal processor, I don't think you're going to improve it.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.640]   And so, well, yeah, it's a great--
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.720]   and I think that the other thing that I'm excited about
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.320]   is really the peripherals that can be built now.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.200]   And I don't think we've seen a lot of that yet.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.040]   And I still think that we've talked a little bit about it
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.000]   on previous shows.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.480]   But the idea of being able to customize the--
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   using the iPhone as an interface for all kinds of stuff,
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.960]   I think, is going to be something that's interesting.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.280]   So as it goes to a year, I think next year
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.800]   is going to be a lot more exciting than this year.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.680]   And it'll be more exciting when the TomTom comes out.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   Are you ready for the TomTom?
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.080]   I am not.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.800]   All my vehicles have built-in GPS.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.840]   You know, my vehicle has built-in GPS too, but--
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.720]   Come on.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.680]   I mean, it's so-- I mean, when you get used to a--
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.080]   from comparing what I have in my CRB to a TomTom or the iPhone,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.120]   is-- you know, it's like--
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.680]   Well, that way just depends.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.040]   Like, on my truck, I have-- it's basically a Garmin Nuvi.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.320]   It's built-in, and it's very good.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.960]   I like the Garmin Nuvi.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.560]   It works very similarly to the TomTom.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.640]   Now, on the bends, I have to admit,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.760]   the proprietary GPS system is a little clunky,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.920]   and the interface is horrible.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.200]   So for that car, it might make sense
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   to try to use the TomTom.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.480]   But I'm real happy with the thing I have in the truck.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.320]   And I do have a couple of those little portable Nuvi units
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.080]   for if I'm in a rental car or something.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.000]   So, you know, I don't know, the screen on the iPhone
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.520]   isn't quite big enough for me.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.960]   Keep in mind, I'm older than you.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.400]   My eyes are weak.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   So--
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.400]   I get into a lot of trouble because we
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.640]   were doing a shoot in Dallas a couple weeks ago.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.560]   And I got into some trouble because I was--
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.520]   I wasn't texting while driving, but I
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.200]   was mapping while driving.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.160]   Did you hold over?
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.360]   No, no.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.400]   The person that was driving with me offered to drive
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.760]   or offered to run the map, but did not want me to do both.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.400]   I can't imagine why, Alex.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.040]   You know, you're--
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.440]   It's just a lucky thing you didn't get pulled over in Texas
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.320]   because I believe standard protocol there
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.640]   is to tase first and ask questions later.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.520]   You know, and you know, tasing would not be good for the iPhone.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   No.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   You know, it's--
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   Nor my--
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   Nor my pacemaker.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.960]   Now, it looks like Apple has been--
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.360]   and I don't know how big of a news this is.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.760]   It looks like Apple has been hit with another infringement suit.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.160]   This one coming-- now, and Apple's not the only one.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.600]   This is-- and this is a really--
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.560]   have you seen that it's really obscure?
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   It has been--
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.240]   This one against AT&T and Apple?
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.920]   This one's against Apple, Sony, and Nintendo for--
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920]   Oh, I have--
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.000]   --you know, and patent involving technology used in the iPhone,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.920]   Wii, and PS2, among others.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.080]   The plaintiff shared memory graphics holds--
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.720]   described as shared memory graphics accelerator system.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.880]   So, you know, and it's--
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   this one, you know, it's hard to tell
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.320]   whether these guys are just simply, you know,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.720]   a holding company trying to move this,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.960]   or they're actually working on stuff.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.840]   But it looks like it's including them all.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.920]   We're kind of keeping track of it.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.240]   I don't think it's going to-- you know,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   this is the kind of thing I think that--
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.320]   if it turns out that one of them loses it,
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   I think that they'll all settle for something.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.360]   Well, you know, all these things involved usually is,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.640]   if there is an infringement and there's a big if,
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.040]   then, you know, they just involve a licensing deal.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.720]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.320]   And sometimes those licensing deals,
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.440]   people don't realize involve like a penny per unit.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   Get some stock.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   Yeah, I mean, very small amounts of money can happen.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   Are you a Unix guy at all, Alex?
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.280]   To some degree, yeah.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.880]   Have you heard of the born shell?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.000]   Yes.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.840]   That was my uncle.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.880]   Really?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.800]   Yes, that's the born-- that's my uncle.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.280]   And he--
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.000]   No, if you're using it, does that give you a born identity?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.760]   I'm not getting the royalty for that.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.360]   However, I am getting the royalty
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.560]   from my dead uncle's born shell
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.600]   every time a copy of Unix is sold.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.440]   Wow.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.840]   I get like 3.29 cents.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.400]   (laughs)
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.160]   I bet you that adds up to a lot.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.320]   Well, you know, it can.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.720]   It's surprising what those checks come to some months,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.240]   but that's-- most people don't--
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.360]   I mean, they get all nervous
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.040]   when they see these big lawsuit deals,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.960]   and it ends up just being some very small amount
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.200]   of money paid per unit.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.400]   And, you know, it can add up,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.960]   but it's not like Apple is going to miss 3 cents
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.480]   or Sony or anybody else.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.600]   And there's always a claim being made
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.000]   on these things doesn't mean
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.840]   that there's an actual violation.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.000]   If you've been paying attention,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.520]   I know you have 'cause we've talked about it
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.840]   several times in the show.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   You know, there's been 3,296,184.9 lawsuits against Apple,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.880]   I think in the last year.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.360]   And they've--
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.200]   None of them--
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   It turned out to be anything.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.280]   Any big deal.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.120]   No, no big deals.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.360]   And a couple that they settled for a small amount of money
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.680]   and a couple that they--
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.600]   They mostly lost for a small amount of money,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400]   but the overwhelming majority,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.720]   we never hear from them again.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.560]   Right. Right.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.320]   And now, we've got a bunch of--
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.720]   We've got a couple more pieces of news.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.000]   We've got the Audible and our picks coming up,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.520]   our Audible pick and Scott and I
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.240]   have a couple picks to talk about.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.760]   But before we get to that,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.880]   we're going to go to--
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.000]   Leo is actually going to read an ad for us
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.760]   or do an ad for us for go to meeting.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.600]   So take it away, Leo.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.440]   Hello, guys.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.800]   I hope you're having a good time.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.000]   I know I'm in China right now.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.800]   I'm going to be back soon,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.960]   but I had to mention our fine sponsors.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.600]   It's Citrix.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.480]   The folks who do go to meeting.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.920]   It is a Mac product as well now.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.840]   I'm really pleased they've done a Mac version of go to meeting.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.640]   Go to meeting is my favorite online meeting software.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.600]   And I've used it for an awful long time.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.120]   So I can say this with absolute assurance.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.600]   We use it even-- it's so good and so fast and reliable.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.800]   We even use it on the shows.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.280]   We use it on Maxwell's house.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.720]   So Maxwell can show his screens.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.000]   We use it for meetings all the time.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.640]   And wherever we hold a meeting, we use go to meeting
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   because it's just easy to install.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.200]   In fact, you could try it right now.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.880]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.080]   And give it a shot.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.440]   You'll have it installed within a couple of minutes.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   It saves you time, but really saves you money, too.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.040]   And nowadays, business needs to save every penny it can.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.720]   I mean, you can't afford to waste time these days
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.200]   flying to meetings or going to meetings.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.320]   You can't afford to meet in person as much.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.120]   Go to meeting lets you hold your meetings online.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.880]   They include free voice over the internet
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.200]   and free teleconferencing in their $49 a month, right?
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.400]   For as many-- by the way, 49 bucks a month for as many meetings
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.920]   as you want as long as you want.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.360]   You compare that with anybody else.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.120]   I think you'll see why.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.440]   This is such a good deal.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.840]   Great for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.720]   collaborating on documents.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.800]   And as I said, we've even invented new uses for it on the air.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.680]   Just fantastic.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.000]   Any kind of conference call, make it more visual,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.800]   make it more useful, make it more effective with Go
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.160]   to meeting.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.400]   Try it free right now.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   For 30 days, go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.800]   This is a time for you to show it to your clients,
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.280]   your colleagues, too, show it to the boss.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.920]   So I've got a better way to do this.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.560]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.720]   We know you're going to like it and thank them so much
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.120]   for their support of our fine program.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.960]   We now return you to the Mac Break Weekly already in progress.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.080]   And there you go.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   Thanks.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   So for those watching the show, that's
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.640]   how we do it in the big business here.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.320]   So anyway, have you seen-- and now I know this is not--
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.240]   before I say this, I just want to make sure I don't get myself
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:20.840]   in trouble.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.400]   This has nothing to do with any political bent one way
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   or the other.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.240]   But have you seen the new Al Jazeera English live stream?
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.680]   No, I haven't.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.400]   It's pretty cool.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.120]   So the thing about-- I really don't know anything about it.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.560]   I think Al Jazeera Arabic is kind of--
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.960]   it says driven towards propaganda as Fox News would
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.680]   probably be seen here going the other direction.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.480]   But Al Jazeera English is probably
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.640]   some of the most even-handed global news
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   available anywhere.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.480]   If you want to find out what's going on in the world--
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.640]   and they report-- I watch it a lot because they report
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.520]   on this continent called Africa.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.160]   Evidently, CNN has mostly forgot about it.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.920]   So Al Jazeera English is a much more even-handed, great shows.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.520]   And they have a new streaming app, so a live streaming app.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.680]   And whether you want to watch Al Jazeera English or not,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.280]   this is, I think, a signal towards the future.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.480]   I mean, I think that we're going to see a lot more of this.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.440]   It is-- you download the app, you buy the app, download it.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.400]   And it is then free streaming.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.080]   It's not something that you're paying for.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.800]   And the past streams that I've had from Al Jazeera
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.320]   do cost money, $5.95 a month or something like that.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.640]   And so this is a free stream.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.240]   It is the stream that you're seeing on TV.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.080]   It is working-- I think that they were working out some bugs.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:03.000]   There was a 3GS bug that they're trying to sort out.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.800]   But I think that outside of that, they're kind of working it out.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.720]   And I think that if anyone's going
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.560]   to take full advantage of that stuff,
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.200]   I mean, they're really starting to push that forward.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.000]   And there's so much coming in the streaming.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.720]   I think people want to watch what happens when we talk
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.960]   about video streaming to the iPhone.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.840]   One of the things that is bouncing around
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   is this idea of dynamic streaming, which
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.240]   is that basically the video that's coming to your iPhone
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.320]   or your computer, but really to your iPhone,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.640]   is coming in multiple streams of quality.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.960]   And it on the fly can go back and forth
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.700]   and decide which piece of that.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.120]   I think they touched on this on the keynote.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.640]   And we talked a little bit about it.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   This is going to change the way we watch video,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.040]   because when you're on Wi-Fi, it can seamlessly move.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.160]   So when you walk outside and go to 3G,
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.760]   it'll just downgrade that video, but you don't drop a frame,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.080]   I mean, when it works.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.440]   And that's the next piece of the puzzle.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.040]   And I think that I'm not sure whether the Algazir
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.600]   English is doing that yet.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.320]   I just got a brief test of it.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.400]   But I think that we're going to see a lot of channels.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.520]   I think it's going to get to a point
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.640]   where we're watching a lot of our news, a lot of our other stuff,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.720]   just streaming on our iPhone.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.000]   And that's going to--
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.280]   if TV wasn't already getting hit pretty hard,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.360]   us being able to watch it on our iPhone will--
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   I know for me, we'll hit it pretty hard.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.080]   Well, you know, I think whatever it is you like to watch,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.600]   I have to be honest with you, I never
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.280]   watch much YouTube until I got an iPhone.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.720]   But now if I'm bored or sitting around in an airport,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.320]   I'll watch YouTube on the iPhone.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.800]   And I watch a few shows on it.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.280]   I'm not a power user of the iPhone, obviously.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.880]   I'm mostly user as a telephone.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.560]   But I think that the option to get to this stuff
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.600]   is what you were talking about, the options
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.360]   and the possibilities and the paths that are being set up
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.200]   by this new technology.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.640]   That's what's really exciting is we
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.960]   find people creating whole new things like this audio boo
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.400]   again.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.960]   I mean, whoever thought of that, and just how many more
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.920]   millions of things like that will be created, you know?
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.760]   I just can't-- I hope I live long enough
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.720]   to see what you can end up doing with this thing.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.280]   I mean, I can just envision someday we'll
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.560]   be watching the NASA channel and they'll
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.600]   be sitting there with their iPhone app that
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.320]   launches the space show.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.960]   Now, have you seen the Crunchpad?
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.320]   I have seen the Crunchpad.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.240]   What do you think of it?
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.600]   I think that that's a very interesting concept,
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.680]   although with an out-of-keyboard at $300 or $400,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.520]   I'm not sure if it'll really take off,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.280]   because you can get a netbook that'll surf the web for $300.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.000]   I know that Michael Arrington's behind it,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.640]   and he seems to be pretty serious about it.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.200]   I look forward to playing with it,
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.080]   but I'm not quite sure what I would do with that
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.320]   that I don't currently do with my--
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.120]   my first thought is, how do you navigate
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.960]   if there's no keyboard?
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.640]   Well, I mean, it's-- so you can attach a keyboard,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.760]   and we're already navigating the web on our iPhone.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.640]   You know, we don't have a keyboard on our iPhone,
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   and we're watching the-- we're watching--
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.680]   Well, but we can bring up an electronic keyboard and tie it.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.880]   I guess I'm assuming that he's going to do something like that.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.560]   Oh, if he does that, then it makes sense.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.600]   Yeah, I can't imagine.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.200]   I think that it would be hard to do otherwise.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.440]   But I also think that this is--
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.800]   I think it's the right price.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.000]   I think it's the right price point.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.760]   I think it's a good model.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.680]   I'm actually-- people have been Twittering me asking
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.760]   whether I'm going to get one.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.600]   And if he releases it at that price point, I'm in.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.560]   I think that Apple-- I think if Apple eventually
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.720]   is going to get a media-- build some kind of media pad.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.760]   But I do think that the Apple media pad's
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.080]   going to be $600 to $800.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.440]   I think that's going to be the price point.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.640]   So I think he's still in a position where it's just another model.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.880]   And I think that these--
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.920]   I know that I'm getting very addicted to this idea,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.440]   walking around with my media, which is being able to--
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.960]   You know, between the Kindle, the iPhone, the netbooks,
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.600]   I mean, we're going to be back to that problem where
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.240]   we've got 50 devices.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.480]   And I think the iPhone was a step in the direction
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   of solving that problem.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.040]   It'll be interesting to see who ends up winning out.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.000]   And if some of these things just become niche segments that
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.840]   don't really take off worldwide, but are good enough
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.960]   that the company can make them and make a profit.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.760]   And it's hard to say.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   I don't know if there's really a need for it.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.120]   And if you were to compare what you could do, for instance,
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.720]   if there were a few changes to the Kindle, for instance,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.000]   just as an example.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.240]   Well, I think the problem with the Kindle
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.000]   is that it is a--
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.040]   I mean, I'm probably going to get one.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.600]   The only reason I didn't buy one when
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.440]   the economists became available was because it was a three
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.640]   to five week wait.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.320]   Which one of course means you'd be like, oh,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.560]   I'll just wait for three to five weeks
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   and then of course it'll be another three to five week wait.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.920]   But I was looking to get into Kindle DX largely because
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   actually we want to be able to read PDFs.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.960]   I want to play with the--
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.320]   I'm more interested in the PDF service now
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.800]   that I've done the research.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.480]   Being able to use the PDF is something
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.400]   I'm more interested in than being
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.400]   able to deal with the--
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:04.160]   being able to read the economist or any other periodical.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.480]   I think that that is a--
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.960]   I think it's pretty powerful when we're on set and being
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.720]   able to go through stuff of what's coming up next
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.400]   and how we're working and so on and so forth.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.520]   So using it as a tool is something
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.080]   that I'm kind of interested in.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.960]   But I do think that for me, I have
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.720]   to-- well, I'll buy a lot of this stuff
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.840]   because it's kind of my job.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.560]   I do think that if Apple came out with a media pad,
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.120]   something that was kind of halfway in--
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.880]   It would crush everybody.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.640]   For me, it would.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.880]   I don't know if it would crush everything
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.400]   because it's a different price point.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.160]   It's going to be more expensive.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.960]   It's going to have more features,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.640]   but it's also going to be more expensive.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.200]   I think that if Apple released one at $3.99 or $2.99,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.600]   they'd wipe the entire market out.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.800]   But I don't think they're going to do that.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.080]   I think they're going to at least start at--
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.880]   now, I think they could release it at $2.99.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.320]   I think that if it has some kind of cell service
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.640]   and you're buying a subscription from AT&T or Verizon,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.000]   I think that it would be--
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.480]   and they could sell $2.99 with some kind of--
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.520]   If there's subscription revenue, they can get away with that.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.040]   Right.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.240]   And if they do that, then I think that everyone's
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   going to have a hard time.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.920]   I mean, it is a game changer at that point.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.680]   Well, back to the Kindle for a second.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.560]   All I can say to you, Alex, is the same thing the board
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.240]   would say to you, resistance is futile.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.600]   I skipped the first one.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.000]   But when they came out with the second one,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.080]   I said, I'm going to go ahead and try it.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.840]   And I think I've purchased 54 Kindle books since I've had that.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.000]   And I actually read it.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.240]   It's easy to say, I'll grab the Kindle.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.920]   Then if I've got a half hour somewhere where I'm waiting,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.880]   I can read real quickly.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.840]   It's actually extremely well thought out.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.400]   My aunt, who's in her 80s, Aunt Faye--
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   we've talked about Aunt Faye before--
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.320]   she looks at that thing and she just gets wide-eyed.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.200]   She goes, now, tell me again how the books get on there.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.920]   And the fact that they didn't require some sort of Wi-Fi,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.240]   that they built it in the way they did to get new books--
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.360]   if we could get that kind of service connected
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.840]   to some sort of netbook from a Mac with a subscription fee,
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.240]   even at $4.99 or $4.50.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.280]   It's a color.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.520]   Yeah, with color.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.560]   I had to tell you, I think it's game over for just about everybody.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.200]   And yeah, there'll be some holdouts.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.640]   And yes, there'll be some people that like this or that better.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.120]   I mean, there are those 11 people that love the pre,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.200]   for instance.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.560]   But it doesn't matter because there's no long lines for that stuff.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.720]   The long lines are at the Apple Store.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.400]   And the Apple Store is where people seem to want to shop
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.880]   because that's where the products are connecting with people.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.400]   I am, however, very hopeful that competition continues,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.560]   that we see the kindles, we see the crunch pad,
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.760]   we see all these other things because that
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.600]   keeps the Apple on its toes.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.000]   Well, I think that the issue is that what I'm looking for
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.920]   is this all-in-one thing that I can just walk around with.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.400]   So I think that the issue is that the iPhone gets me a long way there.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.440]   I'm finding more often I'll leave without my laptop,
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.600]   which was something that I would never do before.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.120]   See, if you were just to become a Borg,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.360]   you wouldn't need any this year.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.960]   You're built-in RS-232 land interface
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.520]   would connect you to the Hive.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:12.920]   Right.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.120]   And then you would just know everything.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.480]   By the way, speaking of this, I mentioned Verizon.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.040]   And I did get-- we were talking about how it would be hard for Apple
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.000]   to include a CDMA chip in the last episode.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.560]   And I got to actually respond from someone--
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.400]   I don't know if I can say their name.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.560]   So it starts with his first name.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   Let them keep their job.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.120]   I'm going to let them keep his job.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.960]   He works at a company that makes the chips.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.000]   And he said that this information is not privileged,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.120]   but I just don't know whether-- I should mention it.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.560]   So anyway, thank you for sending it in.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.400]   But he said that the idea--
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.560]   he said the discussion about whether Apple could move to Verizon
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.480]   or CDMA in ditch GSM really doesn't apply anymore.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.400]   Back when you had a single chip that did one or the other,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.520]   it meant a major change, but the advent of multi-mode chips
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.400]   from Qualcomm and other vendors out there,
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.560]   the issue no longer applies.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.400]   This is my notebook has a single Gobi chip for data
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:11.120]   that supports GSM, CDMA, 1X, RTT, UMTS, EVDO, EVDO--
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.960]   Rev-- 0, EVDO, Rev-- A, Edge, HSPA, HSUPA, and GPS.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.440]   It also--
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.760]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.040]   That is the most acronyms in a 30-second period ever on Mac 3.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.600]   Thank you.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.240]   Next show at 11.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.760]   So it does this all--
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.200]   it also does it on about eight different carrier frequencies.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.360]   So eight different carrier frequencies?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.120]   Yeah, and is carrier agnostic.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.240]   So the same functionality is there for voice-- the voice side.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.840]   And so the issue is that if Apple moved to--
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.720]   simply moved to a multi-mode chip,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.200]   they would be able to go anywhere.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.640]   So it's not-- while we think that that was--
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.720]   what we were talking about it being a more difficult solution,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.480]   it turns out that it's probably not that big of a deal.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.360]   Now, how much more is that chip than the dedicated chip,
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.960]   does it say?
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.800]   I know much more.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.320]   He didn't say, but I bet you it's--
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.760]   That could be very interesting.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.180]   It probably affect the end product
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.960]   cost by $10 or $15.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.560]   I mean, these chips, a lot of these--
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.360]   a lot of these chips are not particularly expensive.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.040]   The ones that are built out there,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.160]   they're just one component in a lot of other components
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   that are going on.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.280]   But I don't know what the actual price is.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.480]   I could be totally wrong.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.680]   So the--
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.960]   There might be a cost in battery life, though.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.840]   There could be, to have something like that.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.440]   The multi-mode chips do have a battery life
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.720]   cost occurring in my research.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.600]   A lot of people have been complaining about the battery
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.640]   life on the 3GS.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.960]   And I've actually found it to be longer than the 3G.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.680]   But I've also--
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.560]   I think part of the problem with the 3GS
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.800]   is that with all the services going,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.200]   it can actually seem like you're getting
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.280]   a lot of battery drain.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.360]   I mean, if you're hunting for Bluetooth and you're hunting
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.520]   for Wi-Fi and you got the GPS turned on,
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.200]   and it's all working at the same time,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.480]   even though you don't need it, it does seem to drain the battery.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.080]   But all you have to do is disable those services
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.920]   when you don't need them.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.720]   And I'm actually getting about an hour more per day.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.000]   I think the other thing that I did is I finally
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.200]   built a workable solution to making sure
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.560]   that my microphone didn't die.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.720]   Because I was constantly running out of power.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.400]   But it was because I wasn't plugging it in for two or three
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.840]   days because it wasn't convenient.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.320]   So what I did is I went out and spent the money,
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.600]   and I have a little-- one of those little iPhone stands
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.880]   that sits next to my office desk, and one
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.240]   that sits next to the bed, and one that sits in the kitchen.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.200]   And I just set my phone down.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.840]   I just set it in one of those guys.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.520]   We'll see.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.920]   The way I just goes away.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.200]   The way I do it is I have about 20 pairs of reading glasses.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.640]   Because I refuse to look like B. Arthur and wear a thing
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.000]   around my neck.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.960]   So I just, wherever I have a pair of reading glasses
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.640]   laying around the office or home,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.800]   I also have an iPhone charger.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.840]   So either way, I can just drop the phone there
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.320]   and pick up the glasses, whatever.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Yeah, so being able to put that stuff down
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   has made it a lot easier.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.760]   And then I have a Mophie, which is a--
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.880]   I have a Mophie, too.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.280]   I have a love/hate relationship with the Mophie.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.760]   I love the battery life.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.800]   It gives me.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.360]   Do you have the-- one of the old ones?
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.880]   I've been the newest one they have.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.320]   But let's put it like this.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.360]   When on their website, there is a replacement part
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.080]   for the top cap available.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.280]   Buy it.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.480]   You buy it because it breaks immediately.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.800]   And it seems to me that if you know that you have a problem
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.200]   with that, that you should think redesign,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.600]   rather than continually making people buy new top caps for it.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.840]   And it just-- I abandoned the top cap
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.680]   because it's such a hassle.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.880]   I still have the older one and I like it a lot.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.800]   And it's not something I use.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.320]   I know some people who just leave it in all day.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.680]   I just have it as a backup.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   Well, some people are claiming that you get reduced reception
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.000]   with it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.200]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.640]   We get no reception in our office.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.840]   I know, I've been there.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.320]   You're the place that they actually
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.680]   made that dead zone commercial for.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.440]   Well, I'm really hoping that the Microsoft comes out.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.880]   You're the AT&T Microsoft Microsoft.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.680]   And then it powers your entire local area.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.960]   Sort of like a pogo plug for your cell phone.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.120]   Yes.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.640]   Yes.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.480]   What's funny is that in the office now,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.080]   because we had such bad reception, I'm actually--
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.120]   when I call out on my iPhone, if I'm not
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.040]   using one of the landlines, I call out on Skype.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.840]   We go--
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.960]   And I know I'm embarrassed.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.480]   I'm embarrassed that I'm using Skype in my office.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.840]   We should mention that Pixel Core is in a former bank vault.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   So it's a fair day cage.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.200]   You don't even really need to wear
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.280]   tin foil on your head when you're at work.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.760]   You don't.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.960]   It's a very secure location.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.560]   In fact, when we have a deadline, we just shut the vault doors.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.760]   They can't come out until they're done.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.720]   But anyway, the Skype reception--
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.000]   I mean, when you use Skype on it, when we have a 10 meg
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.360]   connection, fiber connection that goes up and down.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.520]   And so it's very--
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.760]   it's dedicated.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.440]   And when I call anyone in the world,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.680]   it's just amazingly clear.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   Clear than I'm getting-- I get on my landline.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.560]   Clear than I get on my-- it's just quite a thing.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.160]   So anyway, that's what I use.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.680]   Now, before we got our picks coming up here,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.280]   we're going to jump into our picks here.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.160]   But I've got our audible pick.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.000]   And Andy.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.080]   Andy is not here.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.440]   And so Andy's not here.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.400]   But and Leo and Andy usually go off.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.800]   And so I'm left to make the audible pick.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.040]   And I've actually been buying lots of audible books lately.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.160]   So it was actually a good timing for me.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.840]   It's been very expensive.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.480]   But the one-- the pick that I'm going to have,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.120]   that I'm going to talk about, that I would suggest,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.560]   that I'm just starting to read.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.480]   So more I listened to a talk.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.240]   This guy was on NPR.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   And I listened to him.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.200]   And I bought the book.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.520]   And I've just started it.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.800]   And it's called-- it's by Michael Pollan, P-O-L-L-A-N.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   And it's called an omnivores dilemma,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.160]   the natural history-- a natural history of four meals.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:23.080]   So this is a-- it really is looking at how we use resources
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.560]   and how we use-- and this is-- I'm afraid--
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   I know mine aren't as interesting as Andy's.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.960]   Mostly what I listen to is stuff like this.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   So anyway, it's an omnivores dilemma.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.240]   And it really looks at how we use energy and how we use
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.760]   and how we-- over time, we've cooked our meals.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.160]   And I always find it--
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.360]   I'm kind of-- the reason I got the book was that it's kind of a--
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.680]   it's a one-stop shop for all these little things
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.800]   that I've heard when I've--
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.520]   when you talked-- I've talked to different people
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.600]   that I know within this industry.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.520]   I grew up on a farm.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.840]   And so you talk to people about how farming has changed.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.400]   And you get these little bits of data.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.840]   So I'm trying to kind of collect all those things together.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   I will say that I don't agree with everything
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   that Michael Pollan says, at least the stuff
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.640]   that I've heard him discuss.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.680]   So I don't necessarily believe in all of that.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.160]   But I do find it to be intellectually interesting.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.760]   So anyway, that's the-- and you can get it, of course,
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.440]   on audible.com.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.360]   And of course, as you know, Audible's got--
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   if you don't like that book and you want to go check something
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.800]   else out, there's over 50,000 titles.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.640]   It is the largest collection, the best collection,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.880]   of Audible books anywhere.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.320]   So you can definitely check that out,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.640]   whether it's spoken word or whether it's books or what--
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.800]   all of this stuff is available on audible.com.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.960]   And of course, what you want to do,
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.400]   if you want to get a free book--
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   if you haven't done this before, you should just go up--
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.880]   it's free.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.920]   It's free.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.960]   You can go up to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.200]   Just audible.com/macbreak.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.520]   And get a free book.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.600]   And if you don't like this one, there's a lot to choose from.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.520]   But the one that I like is the Omnivores dilemma.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.680]   I was hoping that I was looking for dead aid.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.720]   But it's not available yet.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.000]   So I had to buy the book.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.200]   Hello, now.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.840]   This is-- is there a Spartans version of this book available?
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.920]   No, no.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.680]   Evidently, there's no Spartans in the whole book.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.320]   But I will always suggest the Spartans.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.080]   The Spartans is a great--
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.480]   you know, here's the worst part.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.880]   I tried to get my dad to download the Spartans
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.720]   because he's now downloading all these books on Audible.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.960]   As soon as he got his iPod, he was using some other service.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.800]   And now he's using Audible.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.400]   And he's downloading all these books.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.280]   And I tried to-- you know, why he tried the Spartans?
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.520]   And he looked at me and he said,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.480]   I'd really like to download a book that I will actually listen to.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.760]   That was kind of cool.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.560]   It was a little rough.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   It was a little rough.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.680]   I cried a little.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.560]   But anyway, so-- but the Spartans is always a good choice.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.520]   If you don't like this one, you can always go back.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.680]   It's always a good one to go back to.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.280]   Now, picks of the week.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.600]   You've got something for us?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.840]   You know, I do.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.520]   It's a very unusual pick for me.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.000]   But I don't think I've done this very often at all.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.680]   I'm picking a website.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.880]   A website?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.360]   A website, yeah.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.400]   And of course, it's photo-related.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:11.720]   Yes.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.520]   Because that's just kind of where I live these days.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.600]   But it's-- I'm sure you use Flickr, don't you?
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.320]   I do use Flickr.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:22.640]   OK.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.320]   Well, my pick is sort of like Flickr on steroids.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's called Smugmug.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.080]   Smugmug.com, smu-g, m-u-g.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.000]   And it does a lot of the things that Flickr does, not everything.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.320]   And it costs money, whereas Flickr is free,
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.720]   except if you get a pro account.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.360]   But the thing I like about it is, first of all,
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.560]   there are no ads of any kind put around your photographs.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   No spam, no ads, no nothing.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   You have creative control over the way
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.560]   it looks using complete CSS customization.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.360]   You can make it look pretty much any way you want.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.320]   At Photo Focus, we're using a Smugmug gallery
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   to serve our video.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.200]   That's another thing I like about it, Alex.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.840]   And this is one I think I recommend
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.680]   you look at it for video.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.720]   It's video is the best quality I've seen.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.040]   It also is not flash-based, which
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.800]   means it works on the iPhone.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.680]   Wow.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.280]   So this is an 8.264.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.120]   And I mean, it's crystal clear.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.560]   It looks good, really good on the screen.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.720]   Works on an iPhone, so you don't have that issue.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.520]   And then sort of the killer thing for me
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.800]   is I'm on this kick lately where I read the terms of service
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.360]   agreements.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.160]   I'm actually reading ULA's and TOS's.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.520]   That's the kind of person I am.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.280]   I can't help it.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.440]   And if you read the terms of service agreement,
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   some of these online photo sharing sites,
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.640]   you're basically giving them your photography.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.400]   Now, for some people, that doesn't mean a thing.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.000]   Some people that are--
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:57.720]   they're amateurs.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.880]   They don't ever intend to sell a picture.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.000]   They don't care who uses their photograph.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.640]   No big deal.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.680]   But if you do care about who uses your photograph,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.840]   if you do hope to sell a picture,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.800]   then you want to read the terms of service.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.680]   And the terms of service at Smugmug say basically, you know
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.040]   what?
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.840]   It's your stuff.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.040]   It'll never be ours.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.400]   Go for it.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.840]   So I really like that.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.360]   They have different classes of service.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.600]   They also have these things called Smugs
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.280]   around the country, which are sort of the user groups
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.520]   for people interested in photography.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:27.840]   I don't know.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.640]   I just think it's a really cool site.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.600]   I'm using it for a couple of things.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.520]   I'm experimenting with it.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.040]   It definitely is the best looking of all these sites.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.360]   It does not have some of the social network features
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.040]   of Flickr.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.720]   So if that's your thing, it's not really what you want to be.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.160]   But particularly if you're hoping to sell your photos,
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.520]   distribute them in a way that is more professional,
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.120]   then take a look at it at smugmug.com.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.720]   Great.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.560]   And we showed a little bit of that on the show.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.160]   And mine, I'm going back to the iPhone.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.280]   Going back-- and that's where I've
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.120]   been getting most of my new apps right now--
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.480]   is the iPhone.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.920]   And so my suggestion-- and part of this
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.360]   is that you need to see what's possible.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.600]   It's Doom.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.400]   So Doom is now available on the iPhone.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.280]   The video game?
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   The video game is now available on the iPhone.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   So there's a lot of serious carnage that is available,
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.360]   which I think is always a good thing.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.000]   And I haven't completely figured it all out yet.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.920]   But what's amazing is when you think about the iPhone--
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.560]   part of why I'm suggesting it is just
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:44.000]   that it's when you think about the iPhone as a platform
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.040]   for games, when you watch the Doom in the 3D rendering
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.000]   that's going on in there, it's pretty outrageous.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.160]   So do you tilt the phone around?
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.800]   You can tilt it.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:02.720]   You can click on things to change the weapons and the fire
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.320]   and you can aim.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.600]   And there's a lot of that's all happening while you're--
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.200]   Being chased by monsters?
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.760]   Yeah, you're being chased by monsters
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.920]   and you're sitting there firing away.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.840]   So anyway, it is a Doom.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.400]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.040]   And I think that it's definitely something to check out.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.720]   Again, I'm oftentimes looking--
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.360]   the one issue with the Doom iPhone
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   is that someone's mentioning this right now.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.720]   It's a little on rails.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.040]   So you're not quite wandering around the way
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.840]   you would normally wander around.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.880]   But it is a lot of fun.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.080]   And anyway, it would be--
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.960]   I do think that it's kind of fun to play around with.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.240]   And as I said, it's fun as what's possible
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.840]   and what we're going to see in more and more games
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.200]   from a graphics perspective.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.680]   So definitely check that out.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.040]   I was excited to see it.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.360]   I mean, I'm afraid I spent too many hours on Doom
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.160]   when it came out.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.760]   Does this take over for your zombie killing game?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.240]   Yeah, you mean plants versus zombies?
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.760]   Yeah, the thing is that I'm afraid that I got so busy
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.120]   that I haven't really been playing any games.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.600]   Oh, I haven't really played much of a game.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.280]   I start field runners and then I go,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.880]   OK, I got it back to work.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.400]   It's been a little hectic.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.040]   Our production schedule has been a little outrageous
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.280]   over the last couple of weeks.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.520]   And so I'm over everything at the moment.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.120]   So it's a good thing to have in the middle of a recession.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.480]   But in addition to trying to get ready for hopefully
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.880]   by next week, I'll have my family will be larger.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.480]   That's right.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.760]   There's a big event coming.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.800]   Yes, the due date is now gone from to any day.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.520]   Any day now.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.480]   So we're just kind of waiting for that.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.120]   The Canon 5D Mark II goes to work.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.040]   Yes, it's prepped.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.640]   I've got-- so-- oh, wait, I can show you something.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   This is just a little bit of photography.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.040]   It's amazingly hard to turn around and grab something
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.320]   quickly on a ball, just in case you're wondering.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.800]   I just--
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.120]   Which is why I just--
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.320]   Which is reason number 2009.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.640]   Why I never sit on one.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.880]   See, but it reminds me of--
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.000]   I feel like the little kangaroo in Bugs Bunny.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.840]   Yes, the number of potential ball explosions
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.640]   where I just sit on one is just--
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.000]   There'd have to be a lot of backups.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.360]   Here's all I got to say.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   This is not Mac related, but I just have to show this.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:26.920]   See this?
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.760]   Look at this.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.560]   Oh, look at that.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.480]   Compact/card case.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.200]   It's a Pelican case.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.080]   It is an actual Pelican case.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.520]   It's made by Pelican.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.640]   Oh, man.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.520]   Yeah, it is-- I got a bunch of these.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.200]   And they make them for SD cards, too.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.640]   So anyway, so I got 32 gigs waiting.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.800]   OK.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.880]   Well, the photos of your son's birth
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.520]   were just awe-inspiring, and I'm hoping
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.040]   we'll get to see these as well.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:01.120]   Yeah, so I'm definitely hoping to post some soon after.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   One of the things that I'm actually going to be doing--
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.840]   we have these--
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.920]   I just can't think of the name.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.400]   E-starling.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.040]   I got-- from my parents, I got a little--
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.080]   The frames, right?
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:12.760]   There's frames.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.400]   And the great thing about them is they're just
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.240]   connected to my parents Wi-Fi.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.320]   So they don't have to know anything, and anything else.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.080]   I can email images to the frame.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.160]   I just send an email.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.320]   I have an email that's my email to the frame.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.760]   I'm not going to put it up there.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.680]   And so I can email stuff directly to my parents
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.400]   and to my wife's parents in their living room
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.840]   whenever I take a photo.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.640]   And one of the things that I'm looking at doing
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.200]   is while I'm taking all these photos after the birth,
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.640]   not during the birth, I don't know.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.480]   Thank you.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   I don't do that.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.920]   So while I'm taking all these photos,
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:53.800]   my plan is to take just a little bit of a video of the baby--
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.680]   Carly de Hovnard, our new daughter.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.400]   And I can email it to the frame for--
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.320]   so like five minutes after the baby's born or 10 minutes
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.320]   after the baby's born, I can have a little video of the baby
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.640]   in my parents' living room.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.360]   That's awesome.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.360]   Sorry.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.840]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.240]   I mean, I--
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.160]   It's a little geeky.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:12.800]   I admit it.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.920]   It's a little geeky.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.040]   I think having the ability to particularly keep family,
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.520]   not just us friends, but to keep family in a loop
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.520]   with this technology, and some of it is Mac related,
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.600]   I think that's very cool.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.240]   I think it's a great reason to have this stuff.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.240]   So I didn't realize--
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   I'm trying to-- I'm prepping all this stuff right now.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.440]   So I'm building my new iWeb page that I did,
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.600]   like I did with the other one.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.800]   So I've got that almost all done so that it's already just
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.920]   the drop images into.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.760]   I've got the emails all set up so I can email stuff
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.360]   from the phone.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.760]   And so I'm trying to--
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.360]   When you go live, send me the link
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.120]   so I can push it around for you.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.480]   So hopefully people will enjoy that.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:55.880]   So anyway--
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.440]   I'm sure--
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.720]   Well, where can people find you Scott?
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.640]   Photofocus.com every day also on Twitter.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.200]   You can follow me at Scott Born.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.520]   And if you're just hanging out September 16 to 2020,
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.200]   if you can find me in Maui at the Maui Photo Festival,
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.040]   they're making me go there.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.360]   They twisted my arm.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.600]   They're making me teach in Maui.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.200]   And so that's my deal.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:18.800]   Great.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:26.080]   And also, pre-wool listening, I have launched a blast on this
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.600]   blog called Border Sack.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.960]   It's B-border-S-A-C.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.000]   If anyone is interested, it has nothing to do with Macs.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   It has nothing to do with photos.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   It has nothing to do with.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:35.600]   But it makes--
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.400]   you know, it'll probably make a lot of people upset.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   Because it's just--
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.920]   I felt like having some fun with it.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.760]   So anyway, so check that out if you're interested.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.320]   And once again, that's border sack.com.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.760]   And break time is over.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.680]   Back to work.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
