[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.840]   There's big news at Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.240]   Andy Enocho's here.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.100]   So is Alex Lindsay.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.600]   Renee Richie has the day off.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.840]   We'll be talking about the invites.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   They've gone out to Apple's iPhone announcement.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.440]   It's next Tuesday.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   It's got a very cryptic message.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.840]   California streaming.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.560]   We'll try to break that down, talk about what Apple might
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.120]   announce.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.520]   And then we'll talk about their backing down on their CSAM
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.760]   initiative.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.040]   And of course, the changes that are happening in the app
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.120]   store, does this mean a big change for app developers?
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.120]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show we cover the latest
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280]   news from Apple.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.800]   Renee Richie is recusing himself after last week's gun
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.360]   fight.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.440]   He says, I'm out.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.840]   That's right.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.120]   More time for the gun fight.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.160]   Excellent.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.360]   Canadians don't.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.760]   He had another obligation, sorry to say.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   But that's OK because the gun fighters are here.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.320]   Renee Richie is not.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   But Andy Inako is from WGBH Boston.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.760]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.880]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.560]   I'll try to try to shoot over my head.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.760]   I'll try to sit down a little bit lower.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.440]   And then you can just go over that.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.720]   Also, Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.760]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880]   No, I was going to say, so are you going to be the piano
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.080]   player who just grabs his beer from the top of the piano
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.600]   run?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.080]   Are you going to be the one who's going to--
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   come on, you fellas.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.400]   We can't have that here now.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.960]   You won't sit those till these are--
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.360]   we can't have that in the middle of town.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600]   I'm going to be the guy who dodges under the piano.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.400]   And I'll be back.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   Alex-- no, I'm just teasing you.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.600]   Alex Lindsay is also here from office hours.global and oh,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.560]   nine oh, dot media.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   And I'm only referring to the fact
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.080]   that we got a little bit of email.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   And I'm sure you guys got a little bit of--
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.280]   and it's interesting.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400]   I think we're doing a good job because it was about 50/50
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.920]   split between--
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.240]   Alex is so full of it.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.640]   And Andy is so full of it.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.140]   I know.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.640]   You figure you're going somewhere in the right.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.720]   And it's what you miss in a lot of shows
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   is a different opinions.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.560]   Well, I was also pleased that it was also
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.120]   split 50/50 between--
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   you know, this is exactly the type of respectful, in-depth debate
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.640]   that I love about this show to-- oh, for God's sake.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.400]   Can we get a talk about cougar?
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.520]   Some people--
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.240]   I didn't mean to use the nasty voice.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.280]   I think both responses were very, very valuable.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.920]   And we listened.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   But some people-- any kind of conflict at all
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.960]   is distressing to them for personal reasons.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.440]   And so I understand that.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.640]   And I apologize if that bothers you.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   But on the other hand-- and I said this, I think,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.200]   on that last week's episode, we don't
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   want to be the fanboy program either,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.160]   where everything Apple does is mat miraculous.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.720]   We want to get a variety of opinions on so that everybody
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.560]   can think about it and make up their own mind.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.400]   So that's kind of what we try.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.680]   And I think we clarified it on Twitter.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   The most important news source that most people can have,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.120]   and we didn't clarify it, Andy's one of my favorite people
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800]   in the world.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.840]   So I shouldn't--
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   I don't know about anything.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.160]   When Mommy and Daddy fight, people get upset tummies.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.240]   But Mommy and Daddy still love each other.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.080]   Well, anywhere Andy and I are within 50 miles of each other,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200]   there's a tully somewhere that we're
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   going to be eating at and talking about stuff.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.820]   Right.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.380]   I miss the, as I always do, for obvious.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.980]   See, some people don't like conflict.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.180]   I just don't like Twitter.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.200]   So I always miss this.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.300]   So there was a Twitter back and forth on this, too.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.640]   That makes sense.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.820]   A lot of--
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.120]   There's a lot of Twitter.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   Was there?
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.500]   I added more Twitter followers in one week than I've added.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   Oh, God.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.000]   Good.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Good.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.980]   I was like, oh, well, there you go.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.100]   Well, we're going to get to that,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.740]   because Apple has made some more changes.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.240]   New York Times says Apple gives ground in a strategic retreat.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.600]   Actually, in two different ways, one on CSAM detection.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.320]   We'll talk about that.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.240]   And we'll talk about the new App Store rules as well.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.320]   But I guess we should really start with the fact
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.760]   that this morning invites were sent out.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.880]   As Andy said, the balloon has gone up.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.000]   There will be an Apple event a week from today, September 14.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.220]   And presumably, it's for the iPhone.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.900]   Apple's teasing the event with the tagline,
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.940]   "California streaming."
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.940]   OK.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.020]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.580]   That's a little bit more blatant than we're used to.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.660]   We're used to just looking at shadows
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.060]   in the middle of the graphic and deciding that, hey,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.700]   does that kind of look like an external satellite
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.900]   antenna or not?
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.460]   But this is--
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.780]   are they just going to spend 45 minutes
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.640]   talking about the success of Ted Lasso?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.680]   Because if they are, I'm totally on board for that.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   Shortbread recipes.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.280]   Here's Jaws tweet.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.800]   It says, "Dreg Jaws, we act.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.440]   We're California streaming."
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.800]   By the way, I hope Jaws gets some stage time this time.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.120]   That would be really nice.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.080]   "We're California streaming September 14.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.480]   Seal you real soon, #AppleEvent."
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.520]   Here's the video.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.960]   It's the Apple logo glowing, right where
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.160]   Tim Cook usually stands.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.680]   Notably, something that looks very AR.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.760]   Oh, you're right.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.000]   It isn't real.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   It's floating with a shadow.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.960]   And then we go into it, and then we're in some--
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   where is this?
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   Is this Mammoth Lake or something?
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   They're not going to announce a new version of Mac OS 11,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.600]   are they?
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.640]   Mammoth Lake?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.140]   I don't know.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.920]   Is it Tahoe?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   I don't know.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.400]   There isn't Tahoe.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.840]   There's some pictures from our vacation from Yosemite,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.040]   taken with the new article.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.600]   It's taking you somewhere else.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.320]   This doesn't tell you anything, does it?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.960]   But I do like the augmented reality.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.720]   So you think-- that actually is a good take, Alex.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.040]   You think this will be--
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.760]   it'll be more than the iPhone 13, or it will be the iPhone 13
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.520]   in the context of AR.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.000]   We're no longer an appointee.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.280]   Are they going to show-- talk about AR.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.640]   They're going to talk about AR every single show.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.960]   So they're now-- I think that they're
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.160]   in the landing protocol.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.880]   And so what we're going to see is continued discussion about AR
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.040]   and more examples of what that looks like.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.240]   And it's already at its--
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.120]   it's already compelling as far as what they're doing.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.080]   We're working with somebody that--
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.400]   they did a couple parts for their company.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.280]   And the company sales guys got an opportunity
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.480]   to use it in the field with just a handful of parts
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.760]   that were just examples that they showed some of their clients.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   And the response was so intense that they were like,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   we need all the other 5,000 parts.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.040]   We need everything.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.760]   If anybody's expecting any substantive announcements
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.280]   of things that we didn't haven't already seen before,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.440]   I'm guessing no.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   But the thing is, one of the most impressive things,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.440]   and the most demoable parts of the new version of iOS
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   is object capture.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.880]   Just how easy it makes it to simply say,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   just to simply be able to say that just, hey, I'm bored.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.520]   I'm waiting for this Zoom call to start.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.320]   Hey, I wonder if I can make a 3D model of this can of Dr. Pepper
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.080]   on my desk.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.480]   I happen to have my iPhone nearby.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920]   I may as well do it.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   So I would love to see them show off object capture
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.200]   and the third party apps that I'm sure
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.240]   are going to be scrambling to take advantage of this
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.640]   and to become the default app that everybody wants to use
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.560]   to turn every the object into 3D things.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.400]   And everybody has been.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.880]   I mean, the apps have been bouncing out already.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   People starting to do lots of math.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.120]   And so I think that there's--
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.360]   I think FXHome, their camera tracking software now
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   does, it'll export the camera tracking data to motion.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.200]   So a lot of the stuff is starting to tie together
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.160]   pretty nicely.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Do you think people use this stuff, though?
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.520]   I mean, I know you, Alex, do for professional reasons
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.240]   if nothing else.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.480]   But I mean, we've been seeing these kind of IKEA things
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.320]   and all sorts of stuff for a long time.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.960]   And I don't get the sense that it's--
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.760]   I don't hear anybody I know saying, oh, have you
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.520]   seen the new IKEA app with the new FX Home app?
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.560]   I think this-- the new version of iOS
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   might be the thing that throws the door open,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.080]   because that's when you get just ordinary people who have
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.840]   never heard of photogrammetry before,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.200]   haven't been using the previous apps,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880]   the previous utilities for this.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.600]   Once again, once it comes to the era of,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.320]   I'm going to do a 3D model of my two or three-year-old
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.200]   daughters, a favorite toy.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.880]   And I'm going to put that toy in all the pictures
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.280]   and all the videos that we make.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.960]   And it could be a fun thing that we can do.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.480]   That's when this thing--
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.080]   In the 2021 framework, that's when this thing kicks open.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.480]   Obviously, we're all working for something,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.520]   an AR experience that's better than simply holding up
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680]   your phone and looking through a viewfinder.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.200]   But I think that that's still so far in the future
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.360]   that we can't really predict it as coming in two years or three
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.040]   years.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.280]   And it might, but I don't think that we can really predict
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.920]   a date when we're going to be able to wear something
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.120]   on our faces that we're going to want to be seen in public with.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.640]   But this is the sort of thing that's going to--
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.800]   I'll just say that for old timers,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.760]   it's sort of like the first time you could get an image scanner
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.880]   that costs less than $300.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.000]   And then suddenly everybody's--
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.880]   everybody's letter to the family has eight scanned pictures
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.360]   in it.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.880]   And now you're just scanning things
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.080]   just so that you can scan them and play with them.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.840]   And then a whole bunch of apps were enabled
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.000]   because now we have a source of imagery that
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   didn't have to be purchased as clip art.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.400]   I think that that's why this feature of iOS 13
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.880]   is really going to kick things open
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.800]   before we get the goggles that we all want.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.360]   And I think that Apple has the luxury of not
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.720]   needing to make money with it immediately
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.040]   or not needing to make a big splash.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.440]   And so what they're slowly doing is putting out all the tools
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.240]   and letting the developers build the solutions,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.400]   let them figure it out, let people like us--
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.120]   one of the big challenges right now is that USDZ
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.080]   is still difficult to develop for.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.560]   But we're getting time to do that before a bunch of compute.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.720]   The problem you really get into is that once something
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.480]   gets to a point where the consumers want it,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   then there's this huge pressure for them to do that.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.640]   And then when it doesn't work, they're like, OK,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.280]   I'm never using that again.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.520]   And so right now, you don't want to be pushing consumers
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.120]   and everybody talking about it and everything else.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.720]   What you want are the first movers, the developers,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.680]   the people who have to generate the content, so on and so forth
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.920]   to have all those tools.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.480]   And the fact that you've been shipping LIDAR
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   with all those phones and all those iPads for a couple of years
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.680]   means that the market is massive.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.360]   And so the thing is that, yeah, you're absolutely right
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.920]   that it hasn't come out yet.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.600]   But there is an enormous amount of pressure building around it.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.760]   And Apple is, I think, taking a very phased and very
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.520]   methodical approach to this process.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   And I think that it's what, again, what we didn't see
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.680]   with Google.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.280]   I think this was the mistake Google made in this area
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.320]   where they jumped right out and started talking about it
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.480]   and showing all the cool things that you could do and everything
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.000]   else.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.560]   And it was not cooked yet.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.360]   And it burned up the phones.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.400]   It's not burned them up.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.920]   But it didn't get much attention here.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.160]   But a couple of years ago, Microsoft
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.560]   had an event that basically said 3D is it.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.680]   It's going to be 3D.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.840]   They showed you how to include models in your schoolwork.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.080]   It was a creators event.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.480]   They announced Paint 3D, which they have since discontinued.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.040]   This is not the first time companies have announced the 3D
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.920]   is the next big thing or AR is the next big thing.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.440]   Samsung phones still have that AR pen feature, which they
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.280]   demonstrated, which I've never seen anybody use.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.600]   I mean, I know you can always make the case, well, yeah, of
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.760]   course, this is how it is.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.560]   Then Apple announces it, where Apple does it better.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.000]   And then suddenly it takes off.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.680]   Well, 3D printers are like a very niche thing.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.720]   And so we're drones.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.880]   And then there's some point where it becomes easy for everybody
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.240]   to do it.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.200]   And suddenly everybody's doing it.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.880]   And then you have to make laws about why you can use it.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.080]   But that is a very interesting example, because I think that
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.560]   everybody who has the ability to create these kind of tools
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.800]   and put this kind of infrastructure forward, they all know
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.200]   that it's going to be important.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.920]   They don't know how yet, because the marketplace hasn't
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.160]   really showed them yet.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   And so we've been talking about Microsoft, Google, and Apple.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.600]   And they've all been doing it in ways that are very, very
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.520]   signature for those three companies, where
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.760]   Microsoft, yeah, they did jump in way, way too hard a few
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   years ago, almost making the impression that, hey, the next
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.160]   version of Windows is going to be all augmented reality.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.240]   You're not even going to need a keyboard.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.480]   You're not even going to need a physical body in order to use
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.800]   it.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.240]   But nonetheless, they built this thing called HoloLens, which
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.120]   is actually very, very successful within the realm of
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.720]   commercial usage, meaning a place that needs training, a
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.160]   place for which augmented reality with a $3,000, $2,000
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   headset with limited capability.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.880]   But custom software developed in-house is a very, very good
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.800]   tool.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.120]   They're having success there.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.800]   Google is having success by integrating this into their
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.560]   search tools, where now they've been building out this huge,
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.040]   huge library of augmented reality search results, where if
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.680]   you search for certain things, in addition to, well, here's
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.320]   the basic information about a zebra.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.280]   But also, hey, do you want a zebra on your desktop?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.920]   Do you want to see what the spaceship looks like in 3D?
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.400]   And you can walk around it and integrate it in your
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.440]   environment and examine it that way.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.520]   It can do it that way.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.040]   Apple is doing the thing where, hey, we can put out the most
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.000]   enormous worldwide army of 3D capture hardware that has
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.720]   ever existed so that once all we have to do at some point is
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.680]   flip a switch.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.880]   And now we have all this power of tens of millions of LIDAR
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.480]   equipped phones and devices, along with infrastructure built
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   into the operating system that makes capture trivial so that,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.680]   as annoyed as you've been going through museums about seeing
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.560]   people taking selfies next to pictures and taking selfies
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.760]   next to statues, now you're going to be just as annoyed by
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.720]   people circling every statue that they like, trying to capture
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.000]   a 3D model of it, only so that they can have this
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.880]   beautiful--
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.200]   a model of this beautiful statue that they can then play
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.160]   with for the rest of the year.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.920]   This is historically what companies do.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.560]   They try to find the next big thing.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.640]   And then, as you say, they're working in a vacuum.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.400]   They don't know exactly what people want.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.240]   I'll be on this panel and all future panels, the skeptic,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.320]   saying we've seen this before.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.720]   This is not something-- it's a niche product.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.640]   This is not a mainstream product.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.400]   And somebody in Kev Brewer in the chatroom said, is AR
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.480]   going to be the 5G of this event?
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.240]   Remember last year, everything was 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   By the way, which is-- here we are a year later.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.800]   Has anything changed thanks to 5G?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.360]   Are we in any appreciably different environment
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.080]   thanks to 5G?
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.160]   No.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.240]   And I think that this is going to be in the AR, AR, AR event.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.000]   I think it's going to be the same result.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I agree.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I don't think it's going to be our event.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   I'm going to say is that Andy's point, again, is that the
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.360]   object capture is a huge missing piece that got added.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.120]   And right now, all we've seen is Apple put it out, and Apple
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.920]   very smartly didn't build a full-featured app.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   So what they did is they built out the architecture to do it.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.040]   They built out some examples that were a little hard to use.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.880]   And what that did is create space for developers to develop
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.800]   into, and to build their own ideas around it, because of
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.400]   Apple had built their own app, which they very much could have.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.000]   They would have wiped out a lot of thought process.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.960]   Because people would have said, well, everyone's going to use
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.640]   that app.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.520]   And so as a result, kind of what they did with the
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.240]   iBooks Publisher.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.080]   A little bit.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.680]   And again, this is where it just depends.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.280]   I don't think Apple is even trying.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.160]   I mean, they're definitely talking about it, and they're
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.360]   definitely tilling the ground for AR, but they haven't
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.080]   started planting yet.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.520]   It feels like, to me, like they are planting the seeds, as you
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.440]   say, they are tilling the ground.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.880]   They are building the technologies.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.920]   They don't have high expectations yet.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.440]   Because the technology isn't going to come to fruition
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.800]   until we have glasses or something, right?
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.280]   Maybe.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.560]   I mean, there's a lot of things that, again, I don't see
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.440]   influencers sitting down at their meal and creating 3D
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.080]   objects to post on Instagram.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.320]   That's just not-- I don't think that's in the call.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.000]   I'm sure that's also going to be the next major annoyance
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.240]   where people want--
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.560]   I do think that it really is--
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.520]   It's too much trouble.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.360]   It's too much trouble.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   I don't see people doing that.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.920]   But if you make it really easy, I keep coming back to the
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.160]   chainsaw effect where you bought a chainsaw because there's a
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.000]   hurricane, there's a big tree branch that down in your
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.280]   front yard you need to cut up.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.680]   But afterwards, it's like, wow, it's so easy to cut things
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.000]   with this.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.600]   I wonder what else I can cut with this.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.560]   And I do think that maybe that's going to be a factor as
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.320]   well, where people will want to take--
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.480]   If there's one of those really, really obnoxious milkshakes
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.120]   where it's a milkshake, but they also put it an upside down
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.360]   ice cream cone and a big churro and sparklers and people
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.920]   want to take a 3D capture of it as it slowly melts into one
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.000]   into just a good job.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.760]   And for content creators and for developers, there's always
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.720]   the concrete.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   I agree.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.160]   Which is the ones that get into it that believe in it, that
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.640]   start to work on it, will probably do well no matter what,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.120]   as just as it expands out.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.880]   The early adopters who have figured it out because the
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.280]   problem with all of the stuff is it takes time.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.400]   Like, it takes time to understand how it works and where
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.080]   those things work and so on and so forth.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.240]   And by the time you jump into it and when the wave is going,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   it'll be too late.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.640]   The first movers will--
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.040]   I agree.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.200]   Content creators and developers should absolutely be
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.440]   paying attention.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.360]   But when I say there's a new Apple event on Tuesday,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.080]   nobody's saying, oh, I hope it's all about AR.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.400]   Everybody's saying, tell me about the iPhone 13.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.320]   What is it going to happen?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.040]   Your ass, Alex Lindsey's saying, I hope it's all going to be
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.080]   about AR.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.760]   Eight minutes, eight minutes is my guess.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.800]   Eight minutes and all the--
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.320]   Sorry.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.600]   OK, we'll second time.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.560]   And also, I do agree with you 100% that right now, it's
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   such a speculative sort of technology where everybody
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.360]   thinks that there's got to be a use for this that's going to
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.440]   set the world on fire, but nobody can take a guess at what
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.280]   it's going to be yet.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.400]   So it's all speculative.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.840]   But I love it.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.120]   We started off talking about reasons why, like, OK, I'll
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.680]   individually love this show.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.840]   I love the fact that the word streaming is front and center
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.320]   in this event.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.760]   Why is that?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.560]   Invitation.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.960]   What does that mean?
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.920]   I have no idea.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.360]   I was thinking of what is streaming.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.320]   What is that mean?
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.000]   When I got it today, when I got this morning, I was thinking
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.040]   that we're going to see a new attack on the Apple TV streaming
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.720]   box.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.400]   We're going to see--
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.240]   is Apple going to finally try to make something
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.080]   that's competitive with these $50 dongles that do--
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.920]   from the point of view of the person who just
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.680]   wants access to all of their favorite streaming channels
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.320]   does just as good a job as an Apple TV box that costs three
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:37.960]   times as much.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.320]   I would love to see that.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.400]   I always thought that that was kind of a hole in their
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   streaming hardware strategy.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.720]   Or they could just use this as an excuse where--
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.840]   if they have the iPhone 13 but no other hardware to really
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.200]   show off, they've got the intention of everybody for that
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.000]   entire hour.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.080]   They may as well use it to talk about other products, other
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.480]   services, maybe even other TV shows, other movies that they've
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.960]   acquired for Apple TV plus that would not in any way or shape
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.400]   or form merit a whole event.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.800]   Well, here's the problem.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.200]   It's pretty clear from rumors that they're going to announce
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.640]   new phones.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.240]   In fact, there's an FCC filing for a MagSafe adapter that
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.200]   mentions four new models we've not seen before, so four
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.040]   iPhones.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.280]   It's pretty clear we're going to also see a watch.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.480]   But the problem Apple has, certainly with a watch--
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:33.760]   maybe even the iPhone-- is chip shortages and severe
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.280]   difficulty in making these things.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.520]   So maybe they want to do a little misdirection, a little
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.960]   hand-waving about some other stuff.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.360]   Maybe.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   There's one of the rumors around the Apple Watch.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.000]   There are two things that are being repeated by lots of
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.440]   different people, one of which is a slightly larger screen.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   But the other one is that the Apple Watch will not be
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.520]   available in as wide quantities as we come to expect.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.280]   I still think both of those things are rumors, but they're
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.480]   both-- this happened last year.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.760]   Last year, I was like, it was a delay in getting the iPhone
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.720]   and so forth.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.200]   I still think Apple should just flex.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.440]   And just this week, just say--
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   You've got plenty of them.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.360]   Four products that we have.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.560]   These are the prices.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.640]   You can order them without knowing what they are.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.480]   You can order them right now.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.240]   And you'll be in the front of the line.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.840]   It would be--
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.040]   Yeah, you would do it.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.920]   I know you would do it.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.520]   In fact, I know you have done it.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.760]   I remember back in the day, you calling down to the manager
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   of the Apple store in San Francisco saying, I don't know
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.680]   what Apple's going to announce, but save--
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.200]   what is it?
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.520]   Something-- one of each?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   I just had Apple buy one of every--
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.880]   But I think that with streaming, the only thing I could
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   think of is there's a couple of places that I work in that
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.360]   would be really fun to see Apple think about, which would
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.160]   be resolution to some degree.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.560]   But high frame rate, spatial, audio, and HDR
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.880]   are a couple of places that would be a lot of fun to see
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.960]   Apple start to play in.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.080]   I don't know whether they will or not.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.160]   Actually, but I think that we're talking about streaming.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.800]   Those are the places that--
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.400]   There's also rumors that Apple wants
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.320]   to do a podcast network or some sort of maybe streaming
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.040]   content, you think?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.280]   I mean, or are they just going to mention Apple TV, Apple TV
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.800]   plus--
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.360]   Well, we're also forgetting that just a couple of weeks ago
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.080]   they acquired a whole new streaming platform.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.920]   Frimphonic?
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:21.920]   Frimphonic.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.480]   So they could really talk about the package.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.040]   OK, if you say eight minutes on AR,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.280]   I say 30 seconds on classical music.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.960]   At most.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.240]   I don't know.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.440]   Joisted in on those last ladies albums quite a bit.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.880]   If you put Danadamuro on stage--
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   If they get around stage--
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.480]   --on the three numbers.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.080]   If you put Danarou on the bingo card,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.280]   you can have that slot.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.360]   It's yours.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.200]   Danadamuro, if they mention that, you win.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.120]   You win it all.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.480]   That's the center square to block.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:47.980]   OK.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.780]   The MagSafe adapter is more than a rumor
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.580]   because it is an FCC filing, implying
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.220]   that there is going to be some sort of change in MagSafe.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.860]   This actually looks like--
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.820]   This is the drawing.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.500]   This looks like a MagSafe connector for a laptop.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.700]   Do you think this is for a phone?
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.860]   Like they're going to--
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.940]   Instead of having a lightning port, they're going to have a--
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.580]   What is that?
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.340]   That's bizarre.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.540]   I don't know.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.980]   This is all we see.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.180]   It mentions eight iPhone models, four of them
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.700]   as quote "legacy phone."
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.340]   They're all iPhone 12 models.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.020]   Also, the charger was tested before.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.900]   I don't know if I had new phone units, presumably four new iPhones.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.700]   And that would make sense.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.780]   What you do--
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.340]   iPhone 13 Pro, Pro Max, iPhone 13.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.820]   Do you think they'll do a mini again?
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.220]   The mini sold well last year.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.660]   I can't remember.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.140]   It's all over.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.020]   They might do a platform-wide charging upgrade,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.940]   continue to have the moderately priced iPhone, whichever
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.700]   one they decide is going to be the moderately priced iPhone,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.260]   and just simply give it a compatible charging platform.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.900]   At this point, they have to start--
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.020]   I have to start wondering how much money they're
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.260]   willing to spend on having more of the components they need
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.900]   for the old-style chargers to continue to be made.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.220]   It's-- and considering that rumors about Apple, at least
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.020]   wanting to do a completely portless iPhone next year
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   or the year after, keep getting some steam.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.260]   You wonder exactly how likely it is
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.980]   that they're going to be putting more investment
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.220]   in anything with connectors.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.140]   Well, they'll be in a 15 chip, presumably.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.620]   The rumor is a smaller notch and always on 120 Hertz
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.140]   display.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.860]   We'll see what they do with magazine.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.900]   I wonder how they're going to handle--
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.500]   I wonder how they're going to handle that display.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.100]   If they're going to give it a bigger battery
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.540]   or whether they're dealing it with better power management.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.660]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.620]   When you look at the entire product line,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.620]   now actually a lot of manufacturers
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.980]   are actually using a 60 Hertz display as a sales feature
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.180]   saying, oh, look how long--
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.900]   now we're giving you more than two-day battery life
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.620]   because of our breakthrough energy-saving display.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.580]   Please don't ask us why it's--
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.220]   it takes a little power because we're only refreshing
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.860]   to display half as much time as a premium phone.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.660]   I'll channel Renee here because when they did mention
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.220]   this 120 Hertz display Ming Chi Quo--
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.540]   or I'm sorry, Renee says it--
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.340]   Guo Ming Chi also announced that Apple is likely
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:41.300]   to adopt LTPO display technology to lower power consumption.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.860]   Low temperature polysilicone and oxide.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.500]   That's what's in the Apple Watch and apparently improves
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.700]   battery life considerably.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.700]   So--
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.100]   And again, I think that just like AR,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.460]   there's a trudge towards 120 frames per second
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.300]   that we're going to probably see across the entire line.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.980]   We're getting pretty close to completing.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.460]   And that's the one should be that--
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.940]   producing games, producing video content, all AR,
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.260]   all look better at 120.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.860]   And so some of the video content like regular movies
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.020]   don't look better.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.060]   But--
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.100]   And we've discussed this before-- documentaries, sports,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.780]   and order films.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.860]   I think 120 and HDR are arguably a bigger difference
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.580]   than HD to 4K.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.900]   The resolution is one thing.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.060]   But boy, HDR makes a big, big difference.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.220]   And I would imagine--
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:35.220]   Not only that, but particularly on a phone,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.300]   particularly on a tablet, because if you
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.820]   want to trick people into thinking that, oh my god,
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.060]   this thing is a lightning bolt of speed and power,
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.220]   all you've got to do is just make the display update faster.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.020]   So when you're scrolling, boy, it just scrolls like butter.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.460]   And it gives you--
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.020]   it's like the sound that a really expensive car
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.020]   door makes when it closes, where it has nothing
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.580]   to do with the performance of the thing.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.420]   But it makes you feel as though you're
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.260]   owning a luxury premium product.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.780]   And I think that high frame rate is definitely one of the things
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.060]   that's going to help out there.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.300]   It's not just about streaming entertainment.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.860]   In many respects, though, it feels like this might be what
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.260]   would have been earlier years been called a 12S, an incremental
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.460]   upgrade over the existing 12.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.420]   Or do you think there'll be something that is something
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.900]   that people will know?
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:29.300]   I agree with that idea, chiefly because at this point,
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.420]   they have to tell so many people about--
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.940]   so many details about what it is that they're showing off.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.620]   They will have had to have done training on so many different
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.460]   levels about what the selling points are,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.860]   what the advertising points are.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.220]   People definitely have things that are meant to go up
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.420]   into bus stations at this point.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.060]   If there were something really radical and attention
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.540]   getting, somebody would have leaked it by now.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.060]   Because--
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.740]   Yeah, they're making it now.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:54.580]   Right.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.380]   Well, not just make-- again, at some point,
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.540]   you have to get 100 people that you don't necessarily trust
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.780]   into a Ramada in conference room and show them
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.140]   like a half hour long keynote slide presentation about,
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.900]   here is what you're going to be selling starting next week
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.700]   in every AT&T store and every Verizon store.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.060]   And that's the-- because this is the window in which you
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.100]   start to believe rumors, even if they're a little bit weird
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.740]   because, conceivably, six months ago, nobody who was really
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.340]   in the know would jeopardize either their job
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.100]   or their contract by telling you that, oh, there's actually
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.300]   going to be a holographic display in the new iPhone.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.740]   You hold it up to your face and it becomes the goggles.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.260]   It's just that wonderful.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.980]   That's how you basically lose your job and maybe even
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.660]   your life.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.180]   A week beforehand, now you've got, again, people
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.940]   who are making three bucks above minimum wage an hour who
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.900]   have to be told about what's going on.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.340]   And if there's something that exciting,
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.300]   they're definitely going to be telling a cousin.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.740]   And one of those cousins definitely has access to Twitter.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.860]   I'm really wondering what the--
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   I'm still unstuck on California streaming and this image.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.260]   What is the image?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.660]   Do we know what the image is of?
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.340]   Has anybody said?
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.380]   This is zapple.com/appletash.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.860]   It is a beautiful nighttime image.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.660]   And perhaps part of it is just--
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.140]   Maybe that's it.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.900]   Oh, no.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.060]   It looks like astrophotography is a big flex.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.820]   Could it be tall?
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.500]   It's a lake, it looks like.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:23.340]   Alaska, but--
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.460]   Well, we already know it's California streaming.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.020]   Now, if they'd said Alaska streaming,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.660]   I think that would have been really interesting.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   And we're pretty sure that they're not
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.180]   going to do anything but watch and phone, right?
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.940]   Because when you say California streaming
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.980]   and you show a picture of California landscape,
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.740]   it almost sounds like you're going to announce a new Mac OS.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.660]   But that, they wouldn't do that.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.180]   Or would they throw us a crazy curveball?
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.340]   I don't know what it could be.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.740]   I don't know what it could be.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.380]   I do think that California is just simply, well,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.820]   we want to get the word streaming in there somewhere.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.180]   And of the list of 130 plays on streaming,
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.620]   that was the one that seemed the coolest.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:09.340]   Yes, a 40, 50-- no, 50 or 60-year-old hit song
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.700]   is going to be the cultural reference point
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.660]   that we're going to be tagging onto for our brand new latest
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.860]   of its kind technology.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   See, I think it's mammoth.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.180]   Here's the John Muir Trail in mammoth.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.380]   If I can open this, I guess I can't.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.020]   Yeah, I think it's mammoth-like.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.860]   Doesn't that look like the same kind of mountainous topography?
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.180]   I don't know.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.100]   No, again, it's definitely not convicting when the few flakes--
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.180]   We know it's not convict.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.100]   I like it.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.220]   Boy, boy, all the different plays on words
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   they get in there.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.020]   Could it be Wild Willy's hot spring?
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.660]   I don't know.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.380]   It could be.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.860]   It could be.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.340]   I'm just saying, I don't know.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.380]   All right, well, we'll find out all in a week now what
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.340]   we're going to do is it's 10 AM Pacific.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.540]   So we're going to move iOS today, which has moved, by the way,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.540]   for people who didn't notice this morning,
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.300]   is now on Tuesdays again.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.580]   Rosemary Orchard has agreed to put it back where it was.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.500]   So Micah and Rosemary will start the show a little earlier,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.220]   830 Pacific next Tuesday, 1130 Eastern.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.300]   And then as soon as they're done with that,
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.420]   we will go to live-- and they have to be done by 10,
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.660]   because that's why Apple's going to do its coverage.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.860]   Apple will be pre-recorded, right, Alex?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.980]   Why would they do anything different?
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.260]   I'd be surprised.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.460]   I'd be shocked if they didn't.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.100]   Alive, yeah.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.860]   And which means they'll be done at 1059.59.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.940]   And we will then begin Mac Break Weekly.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.260]   And I hope you all will be here.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.060]   If you want to join me for the stream, you're more than--
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.740]   we'd love it.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.500]   We could start Mac Break Weekly an hour early
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.860]   and do the stream too.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.980]   We could do that offline.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.820]   You don't have to do it during the show.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.060]   That's rude, isn't it?
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:48.620]   Put you on the spot.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.580]   Well, Andy, what do you think?
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.980]   Can you be here?
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.180]   If I'm up that early, sure.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.260]   Save the date.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:54.980]   Yeah, you'll be up.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.780]   I think you'll be up.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.420]   I'm just thinking.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.540]   I'm guessing.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.180]   1 PM Eastern.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.020]   So we'll stream.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.060]   And then, of course, it'll be a Big Mac Break Weekly.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.180]   And I wonder if we'll get Renee back.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.260]   I wonder if Renee-- it's really what Renee's doing now
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.940]   is finding out what that mags save adapters for.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.140]   We don't know.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.460]   Good.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.140]   Unfortunately, on that long, long list
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.820]   of lesser hassles of COVID, it's like, we used to know,
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.140]   damn, if you keep an eye on Renee's Instagram,
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.820]   and if he's got an Instagram of his boarding pass
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.460]   on his watch, you know he's headed to Cupertino.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.220]   You know that something's going to be as big as it
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.500]   can be announced next week.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.140]   Now, we just have to go to experience and luck.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.580]   Actually, Micah, you might want to--
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.620]   I'm thinking now, Micah, if you're watching,
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.540]   you might want to do iOS today later,
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.540]   because he's going to be instantly out of date.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.020]   As soon as Apple-- well, we know it's iOS 15.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.660]   We know it'll be probably an iPhone 13,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.780]   and Apple watch 7 probably.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.020]   I would have guessed that that's pretty obviously
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.860]   what they're going to talk about.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.900]   That they are probably, because of the invite.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.780]   Streaming is still something.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.020]   I guess, I mean, it's a stream.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.420]   You could just be very basic and say, well, they're streaming.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.900]   You can also be live streaming.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.620]   I mean, so we're getting the new sports.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.940]   That's where a lot of people are looking at live streaming.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.860]   And so there could be more push down that path as well.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.860]   Well, like what?
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   Like Apple TV having live events on it, live streaming.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.660]   Like you could play more.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.220]   I mean, there's already some of that's happening.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.580]   MLB is already on your phone, and you're
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.020]   able to watch a lot of those things.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.900]   But it could be something that's more incorporated into Apple TV.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   Apple should buy low-cast.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.180]   Since low-cast looks like it's out of business now,
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.460]   thanks to a court decision.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.980]   Pay that whatever that a carriage fees are,
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.660]   that the locals and the broadcasters want,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.060]   and put it on Apple TV.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.420]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.300]   Then that would sell Apple TVs.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.180]   Or anything like a live.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.900]   I mean, right now I'm using my connection
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.980]   to the broadcast world is through YouTube TV.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.780]   Or, you know, a service that would let you watch actual live
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.020]   television on your Apple TV would be, you know, beyond YouTube.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.780]   Would be an added thing for Apple that they haven't done yet.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.860]   Because YouTube TV is expensive.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   It's whatever it's sending.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.300]   Oh my god, is it expensive?
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.740]   It's 65 bucks.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.740]   And then, and they got me during the Olympics,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.140]   another 20 bucks for K.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.740]   So I'm having 85 bucks a month.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.420]   I turned it off, but I'm paying 85 bucks a month for YouTube TV.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.180]   I will say though, YouTube TV, when you want to watch something,
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.180]   like I had to write.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.540]   And everything recorded.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.340]   Like, yes.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.820]   I could have like, yes, yes, yes.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.220]   Because it's free.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.980]   Yes.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.820]   It's free.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.340]   It's not all--
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.180]   Every time you think, oh, did I watch?
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.020]   This week with George's up on Apple and say, oh, no, it's still--
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.060]   I've got it.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.980]   No, it's exactly how I use it.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.620]   Yeah, I just hit yes to almost everything.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.860]   And so I just have this huge collection of stuff.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.500]   It's much better than cable.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.140]   By the way, that's the answer to--
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.620]   cable's losing customers because their prices keep going up.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.060]   But that's the answer.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.780]   Service.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.060]   I'm actually much happier paying 65 bucks a month to YouTube TV
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.860]   than to my cable company because it's a better product.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.500]   And 4K makes it even better still.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.540]   No, you're right, customer service.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.020]   And as sketchy as it can be when you're dealing
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.420]   with any large company, yeah.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.220]   The simple fact that I'm forced to contact my broadband
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.660]   provider each and every year to find out what packages are
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.500]   available because the number of years
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.700]   that I've spent before I started to do this, say, oh, so what
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.260]   you're saying is that I could be getting four times the bandwidth
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.340]   for actually $5 less a month because of new upgrades
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.220]   and new packages.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.020]   And even though I can't even--
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.820]   a new pitch and can't buy my old package,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.820]   you didn't decide to simply say, oh, by the way,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.180]   because your old package is no longer available,
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.620]   we basically are going to charge you the same amount of money
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.020]   for five times.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.140]   So yeah, I got that plus the ability to stream it everywhere.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.780]   Plus, it's--
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.580]   yeah, cable companies have been kind of oobered.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.580]   In some way.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   I like that.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.020]   Because it's like if you've been keeping up--
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.860]   yeah, you had everything you needed
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.660]   in order to keep control of this wonderful lucrative market.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.700]   But no, you basically decided that we don't have to upgrade.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.060]   We don't have to adopt new services that people want.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.420]   We don't have to figure out how to upgrade a customer service.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.580]   So yeah.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:32.140]   The new watch is big and square.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.660]   This is from Mark Gurman.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.940]   41 millimeters.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.420]   The watch is-- again, rumor.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:37.980]   We don't know.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.260]   We'll find out Tuesday.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.300]   Watch is be marketed as 41 millimeters and 45 millimeters,
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.020]   which is one little millimeter bigger.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.660]   But that's the vertical dimensions.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.580]   So it's actually a more significant size increase.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.780]   Yeah, particularly when you're putting it on your wrist
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.020]   and at those dimensions, that could be a turnoff
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.460]   for a lot of people.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.780]   I don't think it's not enough of a turnoff
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.820]   that people would stop buying Apple Watchers.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.220]   But it might get them to buy the smaller watch
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.860]   instead of the larger watch anymore.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.620]   Bigger watch means bigger battery.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.620]   It also means more on your--
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.900]   you can do more on the face.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.380]   There'll be a new modular Max face, according to Gurman.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.740]   He's so specific that I have to think this is accurate, right?
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.300]   Nobody's going to say, oh, Mark, it's
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.940]   going to be called modular Max.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.940]   It'll show the time digitally alongside one small complication
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.820]   showing information like the day of the week, outside temperature,
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.820]   quick access to an app with larger complications
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.340]   that span the length of the screen,
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.620]   stacked on top of each other below.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.340]   This basically, it's Infograph Modular, which I use,
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.140]   because I want to get as much on the face as I can.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:56.340]   A face dubbed Continuum will change based on the flow of time.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.220]   Like wow, man.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.300]   Wow, man.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.420]   A world time watch face called Atlas and World Timer
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:07.220]   internally will let a user see all 24 time zones at the same time.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:12.660]   You do not have that much going on in your life, Sir or Madam.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.900]   I know exactly what time it is in Tuvallu.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.260]   I travel a lot.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.340]   I do like that.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.660]   I rarely need more than three.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.380]   Yeah, 24 is a lot.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.420]   Yeah, like that's a lot.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.060]   That's a lot.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.100]   An external dial shows the time zones, the inner dial
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.980]   shows the time in each location.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.420]   Users will be able to choose to see the time in either digital
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.780]   or analog.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   This is apparently, according to German copying,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.100]   watch faces popularized by Patek Philippe, Breitling,
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.060]   and Vacheron Constitain.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.260]   Apple's also working on new faces for its Hermes.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.900]   And Nike boy, they're really making me print out some words
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.660]   these days.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.260]   And Nike branded Apple watches.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.740]   The Hermes version has numbers that change hour by hour,
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.980]   while a new Nike face features numbers that move based
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.660]   on a person's motion.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.180]   Oh, just what I want.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.420]   I mean, hold still.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.260]   This is only the second time in the history of the Apple Watch.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.180]   The company's bumped up the screen size.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.620]   We did it in 2018.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.780]   I get the biggest they have.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.580]   In fact, I got a 46 millimeter watch face for the Samsung.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.500]   I want big.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.420]   I could better--
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.260]   They could have four or five millimeter.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.540]   Also, the screen is taking up more percentage
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.020]   of the actual face of the watch.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.060]   It's one of the brilliant design aspects of the Apple Watch
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.740]   in the beginning is that you have no idea how big the actual screen
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.100]   is because it just melts into the case itself.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.620]   But so it's a little bit of--
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:42.500]   once again, the disease where it's like, oh my god,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.820]   this bezel is not as thin as we can possibly make it.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.740]   We must make it.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.780]   We don't want people to throw up when they see our screen.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.100]   We have to make those bezels as tiny as possible.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.540]   Still affects watches.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.620]   New models will feature a faster processor, of course.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.940]   Case will have flatter edges.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.780]   The renders I've seen, it really looks like almost like a box.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.140]   The new screen is designed with a new lamination technique,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.980]   says German that brings the display closer
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.420]   to the cover glass.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.460]   That, among other issues-- and you mentioned this,
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.220]   Andy-- has led to production hiccups that could either
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.740]   delay the ship date of the series 7 or result in supply
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.780]   shortages at launch.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.740]   I also read a rumor somewhere that--
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.740]   I don't know if I believe this, but it's interesting
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.660]   that the new line of watches might have a change
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.860]   to the design of the band that might require a new type of band.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.140]   That's going to cost Renee.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.100]   Again, don't know if I believe that,
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.340]   because they've got so much money invested
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.020]   into that whole ecosystem.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.540]   But that would be an interesting move.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.940]   More than anything else, it made me think about if they haven't
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.580]   sort of done themselves a dirty deed by having
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.300]   such a popular and lucrative band market that, my god,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.060]   we really want to change the shape of things a little bit,
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.340]   but we can't, because we can't change--
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.420]   there are things we can't change without making this incompatible
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.620]   with previous generations of watch bands.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.780]   And would they be willing to create a new generation
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.260]   or a new class of watch bands?
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.580]   What would be so important in terms of hardware design
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.420]   or in terms of just fashion design that they would want to
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.460]   introduce a bifurcation like that?
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.020]   And I have to admit, I played around with a lot of watch
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.820]   bands and now I'm just using the sports watch band that
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.540]   came with it.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.620]   I went all over the place and I bought all these watch bands
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.060]   and I was just like, oh, this is--
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.820]   do you think Apple would make a proprietary connector?
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.900]   I mean, they've got to be looking at all the money they're
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.580]   losing to third party watch bands.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.860]   I mean, this one from--
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.300]   I forgot, was it Nomad?
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.620]   This leather band is not an Apple.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.660]   Apple made no money on it, because they didn't patent
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.620]   the--
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.940]   do you think they might do GoPro proprietary?
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.540]   What would they win?
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.340]   If you're not even--
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.140]   I really--
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.140]   I don't know, but--
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.900]   I'll get there in the business.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.180]   They make peanuts on--
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.660]   I would think that one of the smartest things about having
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.260]   that design kind of open is knowing that they're not
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.420]   going to be able to figure out every single style
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.940]   that everybody wants.
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.620]   And to get them to buy the next $250 to $500 or $600 watch
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.140]   means that if someone wants to go out with a diamond-studded
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.820]   Michael Cores watch band, they can get that.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.380]   And they don't have to worry about Michael Cores not necessarily
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.940]   wanting to do a deal with Apple in order to make that happen.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.380]   This is Pat and Quill.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.060]   I just looked.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.620]   And one thing that surprised me is
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.820]   that I'm still surprised that certain high-end watchmakers
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.620]   like Omega, like Philip Pateek aren't allowed to--
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.660]   we will let you make an Omega Seamaster watch face,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.100]   because there are people that they're probably not
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.020]   going to have like $20,000 to buy a Rolex Seamaster.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.260]   But if they might have $40 or $30 to spend
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.940]   getting what is obviously not the real thing,
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.020]   but a very, very good knockoff, a perfect approximation.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.540]   And maybe that gets you sort of primed the pump
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.820]   to wanting to have an actual Omega,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.940]   wanting to get an actual Rolex.
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.300]   I'm still surprised overall that Apple
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.940]   doesn't have any sort of mechanism for third parties
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.540]   to simply decide to build their own watch faces
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.380]   and make it happen, because maybe the justification for that
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.980]   is that they want to control the software experience of it,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.060]   because they're Apple.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.260]   And that's the part that makes the Apple watch the Apple watch.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.820]   But nonetheless, I think that given that they've already
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.500]   made these deals with Hermes, saying, OK, we will let you do that.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.420]   We will let Nike you will-- we will let you do that.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   It seems like an opportunity for some partnerships
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.380]   that would elevate the brand even further from, hey,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.380]   there's a really expensive and cool fitness watch
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.060]   to-- here is like an entry-level, sophisticated,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:59.020]   hey, I'm a big-end-yachtsman-style timepiece.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.100]   What about-- there's been a lot of rumors
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.540]   about new redesigned Apple AirPods.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.900]   You think they'll announce that Tuesday as well?
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.340]   That's the logical place to put it.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.220]   Absolutely.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.220]   OK.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   It seems like--
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:13.860]   I don't know what they do.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.700]   I guess I don't know what they're going to add.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.460]   I'm sure it'll be great.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.980]   Well, I'm sure I'll make whatever we have now feel like it's--
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.540]   Exactly.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.900]   You've got to go do it.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.180]   Yeah, that's what you're just--
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.180]   So old.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.700]   You look so stupid.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.780]   A lot of everyone wants that.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.580]   It's always like, yeah, whatever it is, stuff, it's like,
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.380]   that looks silly.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.140]   And then you go, OK, and then everyone's wearing one.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.340]   And you're like, OK, that's fine.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.460]   And then they release a new one.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.660]   And you're like, that looks silly.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:37.820]   It's circular.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.460]   It comes back to--
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.180]   Well, it's different because every year,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.420]   another X percentage, probably a double digit percentage
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.380]   of AirPod users have either put one of their AirPods
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.340]   through the wash or lost it and are waiting for--
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.340]   and maybe they haven't--
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.900]   that's the second pair that I've put through the wash.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.940]   I'm never bagging another pair of AirPods again.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.460]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.660]   There's a new pair of AirPods with 0.002% grade base response.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.500]   Ooh.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.580]   I have to go back.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.100]   You know what?
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.300]   I like to go back to the base.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.540]   The rumors from last spring, which is the last time
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.420]   it rumored new AirPods that we're
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.340]   going to have silicone tips on the AirPods,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.300]   much like the pros have.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.660]   I know my wife said--
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.180]   Silicone.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.660]   Because he found one in the washer.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.460]   And I was like, no.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.380]   I really think that as soon as Apple goes with silicone tips,
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.260]   every single pair of AirBuds I've had, even the wired ones,
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.980]   they seal things out so they give you--
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.460]   So much better.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.060]   They give you free noise cancellation.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.660]   They sit in the ear canal better.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.820]   They're a little bit grosser.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.340]   But you can always pull them off and replace them
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.060]   with ones that fit better.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.260]   I really think the next big cheap leap for the AirPods
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.660]   is going to be silicone tips.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.380]   I'm amazed at it.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:55.900]   All right.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.780]   I think even I was like, oh, I don't really
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.700]   want to give up wired.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.180]   But I now-- the problem I have right now
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.220]   is that after hours for office hours last 21 hours.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.700]   And so a lot of time when I'm working or I'm walking around
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.940]   the house--
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.540]   You need some light, yeah.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.220]   Well, the AirPods last that last long enough.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.620]   So I just wear wired headphones again,
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.220]   because my wife doesn't like--
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.540]   she's on meetings and stuff like that.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.260]   And so I wear wired headphones.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.340]   And going back to wired is really hard.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.020]   No, you're right.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.220]   That's one real advantage of Looch.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.380]   Unfortunately, Qualcomm has announced
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.340]   that they're going to do a new aptX high lossless codec
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.580]   for the next generation of Qualcomm chips
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.740]   which Apple doesn't use.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.780]   So I don't know how Apple will respond.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.260]   But that to me will make wireless.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.100]   And there is a rely--
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:46.700]   I don't know.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.900]   Maybe it's just me, but maybe my head is made out of metal
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.460]   or something.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.260]   But there's a reliability issue to Bluetooth.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.060]   They drop out.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.260]   They switch.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.620]   Well, I couldn't believe it.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.620]   The switching thing, I have a couple iPhones and some iPads
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.460]   and a bunch of things.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.020]   That's the problem.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.100]   They get very confused.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.980]   And so you walk in the room with an iPad, it says, oh,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.780]   you want to be on that?
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.340]   OK.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:04.500]   Right.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.340]   And the worst part is when you're
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.940]   going to want to connect and you're like, I have the phone open.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.700]   I'm holding it.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.940]   And I have the phone app open.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.180]   Like, why are you not--
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.460]   I'm glad that's not just me.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.260]   Why am I talking?
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.460]   But what I found interesting was by accident over the weekend,
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.540]   I found that my iPad actually--
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.620]   this seems obvious now, but it didn't seem--
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.700]   I can walk my entire house with my iPad
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.060]   in a way that I can't do with my phone.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.860]   So the transmitter is obviously a lot more powerful.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.140]   So I just put my iPad on in the middle of the house.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.540]   It's ground zero and then you have a radius.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.700]   I don't know where your country is.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:48.260]   But that is a unique pain point, at least for me,
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.780]   that this is one of the reasons why I'm like,
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.540]   oh, why do you have to not even give me
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.260]   the option of wired headphones?
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.220]   Because oftentimes, when I want to listen to music,
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.620]   it's like, I'm in a state where, oh, God, I just
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.420]   need to take a break.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.740]   I just want to listen to music.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.140]   The last thing I want to do in that mode
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.260]   is to have to troubleshoot something.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.820]   That's not calming me down.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.740]   That is making me even more angry with the world
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.380]   and feeling as though on this day I do not count as monks,
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.300]   God's beloved.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.180]   It's the same reason why a streaming media box
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.460]   has to work so much more reliably than I
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.940]   think any other piece of technology
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.380]   I have because so many days--
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.300]   Tuesdays, excuse me, Wednesdays and Thursdays
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:37.180]   are my more sun-up to eight hours past sundown workday,
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.060]   where I get most of the stuff that gets done.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.580]   And I've booked out one hour, maybe, that I can have lunch
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.500]   and take a break.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.780]   And OK, I know exactly-- there's a brand new tech
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.300]   mode video.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.620]   There's a brand new project, Minky Vid.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.700]   I'm saving it for lunch.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.420]   And I sit down.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:51.780]   Great.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.820]   I've got my sandwich.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.500]   I've got my soda.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.740]   This is icy cold.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.700]   Pick up the remote.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.980]   And I can't connect to the internet.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.580]   And you're supposed to calm me down and entertain me.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.460]   And let me take a break from the stresses of my work a day life.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.020]   And yet you've dropped me right back into the Old Testament.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.540]   I feel as though I'm not spending my $89 for you streaming
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.020]   box service very, very wisely.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.900]   So that becomes a factor when it comes to wireless earbuds
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.740]   and things like that.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.660]   I love wires because you plug it in.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.020]   And so long as the laws of physics that make electrons go
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.060]   through copper works, you're good.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.900]   And the phone is never confused about what you're attached to.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.380]   Exactly.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.580]   So I got to start.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.340]   Or you have a--
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:38.700]   I got the latest generation four of those Sony noise
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:39.900]   canceling headphones.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.180]   And those are the nice ones because they
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.860]   can pair with two different devices simultaneously.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.700]   And now it's like, oh, but I have three or four devices
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.020]   I might want to listen to them with.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.340]   Now I'm going to have to re-pair them with something else.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.340]   It's like, it's not the worst problem in the world.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.260]   But it's like the reason why I really
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.300]   wish I had the option of just plugging in if I want to plug in.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.580]   I still plug in my phones too when I'm on the road.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.300]   So if I'm driving to LA, I drive to LA most of the time now.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.780]   And when I drive to LA, I just put wired headphones in.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.860]   And then with a lightning headphone jack,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.060]   and then you can charge them back.
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.260]   I use a jack because then I know I'm
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.940]   getting a really good quality.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.020]   This is $100 digital audio converter.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.900]   You plug it in to the lightning port or the USB-C port.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.380]   It supports either.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.100]   And then you have headphones.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.700]   And the problem is you have to carry this thing around.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.820]   But it's better quality.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.300]   So I'm surprised you guys don't use DACs
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.260]   because I think you both have our audio files.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.780]   I like it.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.300]   I'm not convinced that I can really tell the difference,
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.700]   even when it comes to lossless audio.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.180]   Or--
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.220]   Oh, you can tell it--
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.740]   I'm tired of Bluetooth.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.220]   I'm sure.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.260]   Yes, I would say so.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.460]   But when I have to buy a brand new album,
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.220]   a brand new release album, so it's not as though it's
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.420]   been out for five or 10 years.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   And maybe I can buy it on eBay for $3 used.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.620]   I will buy it in high resolution audio.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.380]   But I'm even not totally convinced
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.860]   that I can hear the difference between a lossless CD
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.940]   rip and high res.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.860]   I keep trying to navigate--
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.420]   No, I think you're right on that.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.260]   But the dad--
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.860]   So that's the last thing to have a CD quality anyway, right?
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.820]   Well, maybe I'll try it.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.300]   But that would be another reason why I
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.740]   think that a lot of people would be--
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.260]   a lot of people would be complaining about having
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.460]   a portless iPhone.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.140]   So OK, great.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:36.460]   So I'll just have a Bluetooth connection to my $500 DAC.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:36.980]   Great.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.500]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.940]   And I have to admit that I notice--
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.620]   I have the ability to listen to it
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.780]   in a pretty high quality in the office.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.700]   And I find that I notice spatial a lot more than I
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.500]   notice lossless.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.460]   So right now, I'll notice when something--
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.180]   because of what I do, I'd much rather have it in spatial.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.260]   If someone said you can only have lossless or spatial,
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.740]   I would take spatial over and over and losses.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.740]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.380]   It's like, yeah, you can only have--
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.380]   you had lossless mono versus lossy stereo.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.500]   Or lossless stereo.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.940]   You could use lossy stereo.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.900]   When you--
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.740]   I've heard the last year listening to a lot of spatial.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   And all I can say is that once you get used to it,
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.860]   mono and stereo are kind of the same.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.860]   Like they're like--
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   They're like--
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.180]   OK, so they're like all looking together.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:16.860]   That's cute.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.460]   I'm turning into the format because I
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.580]   notice now with every new technology,
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.540]   my take is--
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.140]   agh, you don't really need that.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.140]   But--
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.380]   Yeah, that's terrible.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.140]   But I got to say though, you got me--
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.340]   OK, so this hip-- it's only 169.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.500]   Oh, the hip tag is great.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.940]   I highly recommend it.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.380]   I should try to--
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.460]   I often joke about, oh, I'm buying this as research.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.940]   But you've actually got me thinking
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.180]   that maybe I should see if I can taste the difference.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.460]   But then, well, see, this is the problem.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.780]   Now you're going to have to get really good headphones wired.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:47.620]   Oh, I'm good with that.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.140]   OK, yeah.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.300]   Excuse me, my testing is incomplete.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.460]   I need $600 same house or whatever.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.620]   Yeah, yeah, that's what I did.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   Hi, this is why it's so much fun to talk about this stuff
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.020]   because there is an entirely other orbit where--
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.020]   I saw a review of a--
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:10.740]   I myself have a digital media--
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.900]   DMP, I think they're calling them now--
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.980]   like a digital media player.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:17.340]   I have a digital walkman that carries my entire library
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.380]   and most of it, like either high res or flack at this point.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.100]   But-- and I was like, oh, geez,
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.740]   I really want to spend $200 for it.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.100]   And I was on YouTube.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.780]   I was recommended a review of a $2,000 version of this
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.460]   because it has all the solid gold contacts
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.260]   and all of the premier sort of audio--
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.740]   I can't even baloney eyes.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.900]   The technology that supposedly justifies $2,000
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.940]   for this high-end, pocketable media player.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.100]   Well, do you want-- and you will never make those people happy.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:55.540]   Do you want the $3,000 headphones or the $4,000 headphones?
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.420]   Because then you're really going to hear the difference,
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.980]   Andy, I'm just saying.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.100]   Are you buying them for me?
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.180]   Because my friend-- No, no.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:03.940]   OK, that case.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.060]   You know, who's reviewed these Steli as in he's now,
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.860]   I think, reviewing the Utopia is Scott Wilkinson.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.700]   And he just raves about them.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.820]   But yeah, I can't bring myself.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.460]   It's hard because it's--
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.260]   He's the one to turn me out of the IFI hip-deck, too.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.660]   And if I were in my 20s, I might be a little more convinced
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.160]   that--
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:21.860]   That's a good point.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.980]   I know that my hearing has degraded,
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.020]   as hearing does over the decades.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.260]   And every time I'm confronted with a purchase decision like that,
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.660]   I'm always thinking about--
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.140]   let's say that I was in the financial heavy weight
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.340]   that I could spend $4,000 on headphones.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.500]   I would be more likely to not absolutely dismiss
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.100]   the idea of buying super high-premium headphones.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.060]   But I would think, OK, but let's think about this
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:51.420]   as $4,000 for the budget on a budget of enjoying music.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.940]   Would you rather buy much better speakers for your living
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.420]   room?
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.860]   Would you much rather travel to Laskala to see opera
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.060]   in one of the best opera houses in the world?
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.460]   And it would be hard for me to find $4,000
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.820]   to solve that problem with one pair of headphones.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.500]   But again, there are people that it will give them $4.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.260]   I can't necessarily justify for everybody
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.140]   that I have a $1,500 camera with a $2,000 lens.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:14.660]   Exactly.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.460]   Well, I just have my--
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.660]   I got the camera on my iPhone works great, that's great.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.420]   I have my relationship with photography
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.060]   is such that I can have a lot more fun with this expensive stuff.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.620]   And it satisfies that itch.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.700]   It satisfies that urge much better than a phone camera will.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.220]   And I have to respect that people who are into audio
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.780]   are exactly the same way.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.100]   Let's take a little break.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.340]   $169 bucks.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.700]   I got to say, I got her $69.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:42.260]   I'm working.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.100]   Yeah, I'm working.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.100]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.780]   I can say that there's still plenty left on Amazon,
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.660]   but there's one less.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.700]   Well, you guys are talking.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.020]   The other point I would make is, yeah, I'm old.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.140]   I just apply for Medicare.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.340]   So your hearing is less acute.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.620]   But there's such a thing as an equalizer
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.820]   that will then boost it in those areas.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:06.020]   It's not like you cognitively don't tell the difference
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:06.900]   anymore.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:11.420]   So you can fix it and hear the full range of music.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.700]   You just boost it up a little bit.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.540]   I don't think we've lost those frequencies.
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.580]   They're just depleted.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.020]   As in many things when you get older, a little boost,
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.740]   it doesn't hurt.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.820]   The wishing sounds of the wings of death above you.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   I can hear the insulation on that works great.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:33.260]   I can hear those block that out.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:36.340]   I'll show you another thing, very important.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.420]   Fresh air, I should have brought to you by molecule,
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.540]   whether you live in the smoke-filled regions
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:47.140]   of Northern California, or you're just in an office
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.740]   where the windows can't be opened, or both,
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:54.020]   clean air is not a luxury.
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.820]   I think it's absolutely vital.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.740]   And certainly in this day and age,
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:02.380]   we know that clean air can also be a health issue.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:06.700]   Indoor air can be, according to the EPA, up to five times worse
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.140]   than outdoor air.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.100]   The question is, how do you want to clean it?
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.580]   You can get a filter that just traps particles of a certain size,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.540]   and that certainly works fine.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.980]   But I have to say, I'm a big fan of this technology
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.220]   that molecule uses.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.260]   It's called Pico.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.620]   And they've really perfected it.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:27.060]   Photo-electrochemical oxidation.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.620]   It uses kind of like a catalytic converter.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.620]   The traps, harmful pollutants, tiny ones,
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:37.740]   and then destroys them with light.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.260]   It's kind of a miraculous technology.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.460]   You can read more about it at the molecule website.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.700]   It can trap particles too small to be trapped by other filters--
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:51.900]   viruses, bacteria, mold, chemicals, volatile organic compounds.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.060]   If you don't believe me, read some of the studies.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.500]   There was one at Lawrence Berkeley Labs,
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.620]   a Department of Energy test facility,
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.620]   where they showed that the molecule destroys things
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.060]   like formaldehyde in the air, things that really
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.300]   are damaging to you.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.740]   And if you're in a sealed environment,
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:11.340]   it can be really damaging.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.140]   The Molecule AirProRx has actually
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:17.300]   received FDA 510(k) class II medical device clearance
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:21.860]   for medical purposes because it destroys bacteria and viruses
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.660]   in the air.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.740]   Now molecules offering its breakthrough Pico technology
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.740]   on a broad range of products-- we first
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.620]   started talking about the molecule.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.220]   There was just one.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.900]   We have two at home, one here in the studio.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:39.060]   In fact, we got the new big one, the Molecule AirPro
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.900]   for rooms up to 1,000 square feet.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.740]   That's what we're using here in the studio.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.220]   At home, we have the Molecule Air.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.260]   That's for room 600 square feet.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.620]   There's a Molecule Air Mini.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.500]   That's new that's designed for rooms up to 250 square feet,
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.060]   perfect for a bedroom.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.380]   The Mini Plus also has a sensor that can--
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.340]   an auto-protect mode that can adjust fan speed based
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.340]   on the particle sensor.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.060]   So it'll work harder when the air is dirtier.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.620]   Cleaner air, I mean, it's just better.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.820]   Dirty indoor air can contain allergens like dust, pollen,
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.420]   pet dander, volatile organic compounds, bacteria,
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.140]   mold, viruses.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.900]   Molecule Air purifiers don't just capture these offenders.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.300]   They destroy them.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.740]   We love our molecules.
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.700]   Here in the studio and at home, you will too.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.500]   And for a limited time, you can save up to $120.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:33.900]   Molecule Air purifiers by visiting molecule.com, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.100]   By the way, I want to point out, I bought my molecules at home.
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.340]   I spent good money.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.660]   I did not have the $120 offer.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.940]   So take advantage of this.

[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.860]   Molecule did send us the Molecule AirPro
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.820]   that we're using in the studio, which I'm very grateful for.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.580]   I think-- what do we do with the old one?
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.780]   I think is that one we have in another office?
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.980]   So we have, I think, at least four molecules now.

[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.340]   purifiers.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:12.660]   Go to Molecule, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E, moleculewithk.com.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.300]   And learn how it works.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.260]   It's really fascinating.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.300]   Read the studies.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.580]   Because I think sometimes people misunderstand
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.100]   what the Molecule does when you understand
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:27.460]   that this Pico technology is pretty awesome.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.660]   Apple is allowing states to add your driver's license
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.260]   to your phone.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.740]   I'm really nervous about-- first of all, California
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.860]   is not one of the states.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:43.100]   The first states, I think, are Georgia and Arizona.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.260]   You can add it to your state driver's license
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.540]   or state ID to your wallet on your iPhone
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.740]   and on your Apple Watch.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:55.300]   Kentucky, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.700]   will follow.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.180]   TSA will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.900]   and participating airports as the first locations customers
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.220]   can use this wallet.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.580]   Problem with using it is if you're driving down the road,
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.300]   I still carry your driver's license with you
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.500]   because the police officer has to have whatever special tool
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.900]   is required to validate it.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.060]   I'm a lot less worried than I was when this was first being
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:26.660]   discussed about a year ago because the way that this method
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.700]   works is that you don't have to hand over your phone
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.660]   to the state trooper or whoever.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.980]   It's all done via device that the trooper or the police
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.100]   officer is actually carrying with them.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.420]   So you call an identity reader.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.980]   And that is the hardware that they--
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.740]   I don't know if they have to get that from Apple.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.540]   I don't understand how it works.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.580]   And they're also doing the breadth of what this could be used
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.300]   for is also important, where if you don't--
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.180]   it's not as though you're going to be living--
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.860]   and excuse me, for the immediate future,
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.180]   you're not going to be living in a world in which they're
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.780]   going to insist that it's a digital idea that's on a phone,
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.700]   that you could have in situations where you want to get
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.220]   through, let's say TSA as fast as possible,
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.140]   you can just flash your phone and you're in.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.260]   That you can choose that.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.820]   If you're in a situation where you would much rather just hand
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.860]   over a piece of plastic that has just the information
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.460]   on it that this person is required to be able to ask for,
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.660]   you can do that as well.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.220]   I don't think it's perfect yet, but I
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.980]   think that this is a good first step and also a good way
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.580]   to keep driver's licenses more secure.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.180]   The idea that if I lose my phone,
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.860]   I haven't necessarily lost my driver's license.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.940]   If I lose my physical driver's license,
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.220]   I'm in for a big world to hurt.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.300]   And that's just for starters, having
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.780]   to go to the DMV and get a replacement.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.300]   The way it works, you scan the front of your ID
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.740]   and then take a selfie and then that's sent to the state
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.020]   that issued the ID for authentication.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.500]   And then I guess the TSA will have a device at selected
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.060]   checkpoints that can read it.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.980]   So I don't know if it's as quick as going, here, that's me.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.820]   You still have to--
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.540]   You still have to-- somehow, I don't know if they plug it in.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.340]   I don't know what they do.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.260]   But yes, you make the most important point,
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.900]   which Apple also makes in their press release
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:17.380]   that you do not have to hand over the phone.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.260]   You-- let's see here.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.340]   Let me-- presenting a driver's license or state ID to this TSA.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.620]   Once added to the wallet, you simply tap your phone
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.460]   or Apple Watch at the identity reader.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.020]   So I guess it's kind of like Apple Pay.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.580]   Customers will see a prompt on the device
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.700]   displaying the specific information being requested
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.620]   by the TSA.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.860]   That, by the way, is also a big part of this.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.100]   When you give them your driver's license,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.500]   you give them everything.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.820]   If you wanted to use this at a concert or a bar to verify age
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.580]   for buying liquor, it would be nice if you could just give them
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.220]   the birthday.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.540]   And in fact, that's the plan, is that you can authorize
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   certain different kinds of information.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.260]   Only after authorizing with face ID or touch ID
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.260]   is the requested identity information released
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.700]   from their device, which ensures that just the required
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.660]   information is shared.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:10.020]   And only the person who added the driver's license or state ID
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.660]   to the device can present it.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.420]   You do not need to unlock, show, or hand over your device.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.180]   I love this.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.740]   I mean, look, it took a while for Apple Pay
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.620]   to become universal.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.860]   But now I use it all the time everywhere.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.020]   I think it's going to be like that.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.420]   I mean, if you're validating your watch, for instance,
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:32.780]   and it's connected to you, it's probably more secure
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.620]   than you using a card or that type of thing.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.740]   So I think that it's definitely in the direction all of this
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.580]   is going to go.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.940]   You know, it's a standard.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:45.820]   It's the ISO 18013 stroke 5 MDL mobile driver's license
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.140]   standard, which Apple had a hand in,
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.060]   but it is a open standard.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.220]   So yeah, right.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.900]   It is a step forward.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.860]   There have been times where I like to check in to some place.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.140]   I need to at least--
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.260]   I need to show a driver's license.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.980]   And I'm used to that, OK, I'll hand--
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.420]   there's like a-- it's a counter.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.940]   So I have to sort of hand it over so they can get a look at it.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.900]   And there was one incidence in which they took a look at it
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.860]   and then put it into a device and took a scan of it
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.380]   and then handed it back to me.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.340]   And all my freaking God did I create an issue.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   It's like, I did not give you permission to do that.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:22.620]   Where is it going?
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   And I don't care who is behind me.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.380]   We're going to have a long discussion about--
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.220]   so the ability to maintain control over the human readable
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.300]   identity stuff that you need to protect.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.660]   And the idea that there is a higher authority--
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.660]   I'm not talking about faith in my fellow humans,
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.900]   protecting that data.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.820]   That's probably stuck in the right direction.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:46.580]   I'm just hoping that there's enough broad support
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.940]   for the standard that it's not just for people who
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.700]   can afford iPhones, not just for people who
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.180]   can afford even mid-range to high end phones, that even people
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.620]   who have a $50 contract phone can have this level of security
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.780]   on their identity.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.340]   Well, I think we've come around to the idea
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.740]   that Apple Pay is a safer, more private way to pay.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:09.060]   We've been doing it for so long now that any ungodly problem
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.220]   that would have brought the entire system down
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.180]   to its knees would have happened by now.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.860]   So now we can almost implicitly trust it.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.580]   And now we're at the first-- we're
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.780]   at that stage one of state ID.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.180]   So we're going to have to make sure-- this
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.460]   is when all these wonderful theories that mathematicians
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.300]   keep promising us.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.380]   This is why this is absolutely unbreakable and why this
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.100]   isn't a problem.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.180]   And we're not going to find out a year later that, oh,
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:40.060]   turns out, we were using an open source piece of code that's
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:44.060]   only being maintained by exactly two people.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.460]   And it's 10 years old.
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.260]   And we're not using the latest version of it.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.460]   And that's why governments, A, B, and C,
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.620]   now have every single driver's license that's ever been used
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.460]   ever and by the TSA at this airport.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.900]   Some universities are using it for ID.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.260]   Apple at the end of the press release says, coming soon,
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.380]   while it will also provide access to customers, home,
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.820]   apartment, and hotel keys, as well as corporate badges.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.220]   I mean, I think at some point, you're
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.740]   going to get to a point where you don't really
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.660]   even pull out your phone.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:18.020]   There is a-- you have a status that's connected to you,
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.100]   which might be your passport information.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.660]   Your passport, your local--
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.020]   You don't want to be broadcasting it, though, Alex.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.520]   Right?
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.140]   I mean, you have to.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.860]   I think it can be something that-- well, right now,
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:31.100]   you're broad-- I mean, technically, it's RFID in your passport.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:31.540]   Right.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.540]   So you're technically broad--
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.100]   Yes, you are, yeah.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.260]   So the-- I mean, unless you hit it with a hammer
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.900]   under a cloth and microwave it, not that I would ever
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.580]   do anything like that.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.540]   By the way, how does that work out for you?
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.540]   Do people say, hey, your passport's broken?
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.100]   Yeah, they say your passport's broken, and then you go, OK.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:48.780]   But can you read it?
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.380]   And they're like, yeah, and then you keep going.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.380]   You don't like it.
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.540]   I think you can mean it.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.420]   It doesn't mean it.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.500]   It's not legally required.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.380]   And so the--
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.980]   I must have accidentally microwaved it, officer.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.780]   Well, you can't make it too long or leave a hammer.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.300]   Anyway, so--
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.140]   Sarah, I'm going to give you an E-pipe tin foil head.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.860]   The hammer-- I think the hammer doesn't look the work.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.540]   So anyway, so the-- and you're the key is the cloth,
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.940]   so you don't leave hammer marks.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.060]   Anyway, so anyway, so the--
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.380]   Not that we would encourage or tell you in any way
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.300]   how to do this, but--
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.060]   Exactly.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:24.380]   So anyway, the-- but the-- so you're already broadcasting that out.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.740]   Let's go back to that.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.500]   And the main thing, though, is having a device--
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.340]   it's actually far more secure.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.780]   If you think about, I'm handing somebody something,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.900]   I'm handing them my credit card, which is only done
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.620]   in the United States.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.540]   I mean, when you leave the country, no one does that.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.140]   Like, take your credit card away from out of your--
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:39.980]   No, they come to you.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.500]   With a thing.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.700]   And you and they do the thing.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.220]   But the main thing is, is that now you can say,
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.540]   there's a secure relationship between my electronic device
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.260]   and their device.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.060]   Now, of course, we have to worry about whether that's
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.060]   secure, secure, but the stuff we're doing now
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.620]   isn't very secure.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.060]   So now we have this secure connection between it,
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.420]   and it only gives it the information that it needs to let
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.580]   you know whether you go to the concert, the conference,
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.660]   the-- or get on a plane.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.420]   All of those things can be tied into permissions
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.300]   that are handed to you.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.700]   Now, it will make it more complicated when it doesn't work.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.460]   That's the biggest problem with all of these,
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.620]   is that right now, like for instance, when I work on events,
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.260]   they give you little wristbands.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.700]   And so you get a little colored wristband,
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.500]   and you get a different colored wristband for every day.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.580]   And I don't take any of them off until the event's over.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:32.060]   So I'll have the stack of wristbands on one arm.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.820]   And people ask me why, is because when they screw up
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:38.300]   and they lose my name, I'd say you can't come in to this area.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.300]   Is this really?
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.500]   Because I've been here the last five days.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   Right.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.140]   Are we really saying I can't--
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.140]   See all these colorful bands?
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.300]   I can't sleep with them.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   I hate those.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.380]   They just scratch me.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:54.300]   Well, the key is that you don't let them put the wristband on.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.380]   You have to line it up.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.460]   You have to line the edges up.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   They don't do it.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.020]   They don't do it.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.020]   They're going to hurry.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.940]   Actually, that's how we got into Hawaii in July,
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.860]   was you would go to the desk, you would show your vaccine,
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.980]   QR code, and they'd give you a wristband.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.380]   And I wore it on the plane.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.100]   That doesn't seem very secure.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.940]   We were at a concert.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.380]   I was at a concert.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.980]   We were working in a concert in Africa.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.700]   And our audio engineer, literally, he went--
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.300]   we were missing one person.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.740]   And we were like, we need to get him in to the thing.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.380]   And he went to his office.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.180]   And he literally had kept every wristband
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.860]   that he had ever gotten.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.580]   And he was like, ah, which one are we looking for here?
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.180]   Oh, my god.
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.100]   Because they were like-- this one was designed with stars.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.460]   And it was holographic.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.900]   And he was like, ah, here it is.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   Here it is.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.900]   And he looked at it.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.900]   It was exactly the right one.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.900]   And then we taped it to the--
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   Oh, my god.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.900]   You're in.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.420]   So it was the funniest thing that they--
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.580]   he goes, I can get into anything,
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.020]   because I just have the right wristbands.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.940]   Saved all the wristbands.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.220]   It was a big long stack of them, like hundreds of wristbands.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.700]   Yeah, so--
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.020]   Talk about insecure.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:06.700]   You may remember Defcon in 2019, a hacker named MG,
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.900]   showed a cable he had made.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.100]   Looks exactly like a standard lightning type C cable,
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:17.740]   but it contains inside it a radio, which broadcasts,
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.460]   as far as a mile, he says, everything
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:26.820]   that is going through that type B or lightning cable.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.340]   He said they're now being mass produced.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:29.900]   Good news.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.380]   How exciting.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.180]   You could just go right to the Act 5 store and buy them now.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.740]   Thank you, Darren.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.900]   The set of cables MG provided a motherboard for testing,
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:43.540]   also included a black USB to USB-C cable.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.380]   I mean, here's the cables that he gave motherboard.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.100]   I guess the key here is that the radio electronics
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.940]   are small enough now.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.060]   They can fit into what looks like a completely normal cable.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.300]   The end is not even longer.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.340]   We're used to seeing-- we've seen these things before,
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.500]   but usually it's like, oh, why is the lightning
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.460]   end of this about a centimeter longer than I'm
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.580]   used to seeing?
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.180]   This does look like a normal one.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.220]   I can't wait to see testers actually
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.620]   see if this can do what he's claiming it can do,
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:18.780]   because a mile transmission on a tiny, tiny chip like that,
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.620]   even if it's using part of the cable itself
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.860]   as an antenna and taking power from the host device,
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.940]   that seems a little ambitious.
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.820]   I'm sure that I don't have my connection between my iPad
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.140]   and my home router is not going to be one mile unless--
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.620]   one of them is on Mount Washington
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.620]   and the other one is on a blimp one mile away
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.180]   from Mount Washington.
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.420]   But we'll find out--
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.580]   How do you feel about Darren selling these to anybody
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.260]   who wants them?
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.500]   I mean, that seems--
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.260]   He sells a lot of hacking stuff.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.780]   But always with the kind of smirky--
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.140]   well, this is so you can do your own pen testing
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.380]   and stuff like that.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.260]   That's a lot of engineering for someone who just--
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.500]   It's not a hack.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.180]   This is a commercially made product.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.860]   It's $25.
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.460]   From mischief gadgets.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.860]   MG.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.500]   So I don't know.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.220]   It tests a lot of core beliefs.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:10.780]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.780]   It's $139.99.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.820]   Right, yeah, I was just going to say.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.980]   Yeah, it tests a lot of core beliefs of mine
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:20.140]   where it's like you can't stop someone from--
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.220]   you can't-- do you stop everybody
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.300]   from making everything that could potentially
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.260]   be used for bad things as opposed to--
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.660]   I want you to have an example of technology
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.580]   that I'm sure that bad people are going to have.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.340]   So you can see how that would affect you and your workplace
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.780]   or your client's workplace.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:41.020]   Or as if you're being paid to do a penetration test
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.540]   on a corporation, you should have the same tools
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.940]   that the bad people should have.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.780]   There's definitely an argument to be made
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.780]   that there's a good reason for these things to exist.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.500]   However, how many-- given that this is getting a lot of press,
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.620]   how likely is it that, in addition to the people who
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.060]   have a legitimate reason to have this,
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.340]   you're also going to have a whole bunch of knuckleheads
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.460]   who are like, look, I bought this cable
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.820]   and I put it onto my boss's computer.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.940]   And now I can see all of his passwords.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.580]   It says--
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.180]   The cable--
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.900]   I fear knuckleheads more than I fear real criminals.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:14.540]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.820]   I mean, when you start selling this stuff in a store--
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:17.860]   Exactly.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.260]   Anybody can buy it.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.900]   The cable comes with a web server in 802.11 radio.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.860]   It also-- they also sell one that with the key--
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.540]   the key logger edition retains full features
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.340]   of the standard OMG cable and adds a key logger capable
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.540]   of storing up to 650,000 keystrokes.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.220]   Of course, you'd have to go and get it.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.980]   Well, I also think that--
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:50.700]   yeah, it's not a good idea to plug your phone
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.620]   into cables that you don't know.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.460]   Well, now that's one of the main reasons I'm mentioning this.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.780]   That's the main reason, just as a warning.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.260]   It's just that these things are out there.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.660]   And if it's not the cable, the cable
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.980]   is dramatic to have a cable doing it.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.180]   But the fixtures have been a problem for a long time.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.020]   As the fixtures are a real point of--
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.380]   you go to an airport, you go to a hotel or a convention
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.420]   or whatever it is-- Free charging station.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.580]   Free charging station.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.980]   I have finally broken down and I plug it into the car
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.220]   every once in a while.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:24.260]   But I have a--
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.500]   but only with one of my phones.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.460]   And I plug it-- everything else gets plugged into the lighter.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.740]   The lighter has a--
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.540]   Well, you could buy inexpensively.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.180]   In fact, Steve Gibson recommended it.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.540]   And I bought a few of them.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.380]   He calls them cable condoms, which just only
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.900]   have the wiring for the charging, nothing else.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.980]   So you could put the cable into that,
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.940]   then plug it into anywhere in charge.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.860]   You go to a really nice event.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.940]   One of the things they do is they have a little like box
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.380]   in the center of the table.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.660]   A little table's blank.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.460]   Of all people, Steve Gibson's the last guy
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.260]   is going to plug it into that.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.460]   But he uses that condom and then does it.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.700]   So I think that's the thing people should just really
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.900]   be aware that that is an easy way in.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.740]   Very easy now.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.740]   You buy a--
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.060]   That's the one thing.
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.980]   That's the one thing that we'll get into your iPhone
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.820]   is a physical connection.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.940]   It's the thing you're the most sure of.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.020]   So it's definitely not--
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.740]   I mean, I carry around my battery.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:24.060]   And I have-- for the most part, I only use apple chargers
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:24.700]   in the field.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.580]   Like when I leave, I mean, I use apple cables, or I use braided
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.380]   cables because most people don't have them.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.900]   So I have braided cables that are hard to find.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.820]   And so if I--
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.300]   I know.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:34.780]   I like them.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.060]   I only buy braided cables.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.260]   Yeah, I prefer cables.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:37.740]   I love braided cables.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740]   They're beautiful.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.660]   And they last longer.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.460]   And they're gorgeous.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.340]   And then you know they're your cables.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.980]   So just a public service announcement, kids.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.420]   Don't plug into unknown ports.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.900]   Hey, while we're at it, don't copy that floppy.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.340]   Very not for that floppy.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.740]   Home recording is killing the cassette industry.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.540]   What in unknown ports that--
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.300]   There we go.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   Plug in unknown ports.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.140]   It's always risky.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.940]   But at least if you do, if you're going to--
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.540]   if you have to use a cable condom.
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:13.900]   A couple more short stories because I want to take a break
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.940]   and then get into the deeper stories of the CSAM
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.820]   and the App Store updates.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:23.860]   Germany wants Apple to update and repair iPhones for seven
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.100]   years.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:30.900]   This is ongoing requirements from the EU.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.980]   It was because of the EU, I think, that Apple stopped
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.780]   putting the charger in the box.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.420]   This is a new proposal, not yet a law.
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:43.740]   And they also-- this is actually--
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   I'm kind of behind this.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.500]   They want updates and spare parts for the iPhone
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:50.380]   for at least seven years at a quote reasonable price.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.140]   We'll see if they do it.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.580]   It's a little bit more--
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.500]   I think the EU wants five years.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.420]   And they're not necessarily talking about full iOS updates.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.500]   They're talking about security updates
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.500]   for x number of years.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.620]   They're also not talking about--
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.460]   because the iPhone is well within that.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.780]   But it's Android devices that they're talking about, I think.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:09.940]   Right, exactly.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.140]   And even there, they're not--
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.340]   they're right for a pair of legislation in the EU.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.460]   And I think also in Germany, they're not necessarily
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.500]   talking about, oh, well, there's a controller chip inside there
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.620]   that you need to be able to sell to third parties.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.700]   They're talking about the things that tend to wear out
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.540]   after five years.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.780]   So they're talking about they need
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.420]   to be able to provide a source for replacement screens,
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.380]   replacement batteries.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.980]   That's the right thing.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.260]   Right, your peers are moving along in the US as well.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.700]   In fact, the FTC is pushing forward as well.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.900]   So I think that that's going to happen.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.340]   It's becoming harder for companies like Samsung and Apple
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.460]   and Google to argue against because they're
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.780]   not asking for completely unreasonable and undoable things.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:52.660]   They're asking for things that are inconvenient that will,
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.860]   actually, I think help users and help the community a lot.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.260]   I just bought a really nice laptop called the Framework.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.540]   I'll do a review on it in a couple of weeks.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.340]   It came and I put the M&JARLE Linux on it.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.100]   And it is now my favorite laptop.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.980]   I wish it had the battery life of the M1, right?
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.980]   That nothing does.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.820]   But it's got three or four or five hours,
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.660]   depending on what I'm doing with it, which is fine.
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.620]   But it's a really nice laptop.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.020]   And you open it up.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   They even provide the Torx screwdriver
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.340]   to take the screws out and open it up.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.180]   The screws, by the way, I love it.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.980]   What do they call that when they don't fall out?
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.620]   They're captive screws.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.220]   Captive.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:30.860]   I love that.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.980]   So you open up magnets hold that panel on.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.420]   Magnets hold the keyboard onto the top part of it.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.180]   So it's easy to remove stuff.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.140]   And everything's QR coded.
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.900]   And they sell-- and for the most part, memory
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.500]   and hard drive, for instance, are stock.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.100]   So you can easily replace those.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.140]   And then they have QR codes for everything else,
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.580]   including the motherboard.
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:55.900]   The motherboard is removable.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.980]   The battery is removable.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.780]   And obviously, framework would have
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.100]   to sell the battery in motherboard,
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.500]   because I think those are not-- those are probably
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.980]   proprietary Shiforn factor.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.020]   But I love it.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.820]   And it's a great laptop.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.540]   So it's doable.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.500]   It's going to be an interesting case study, I think.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.540]   Because it's already kind of disproven a couple
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.460]   of the arguments against a unrepairable MacBooks
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.540]   and other products.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.300]   Because you look at this and it looks like a completely--
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.020]   it doesn't look like a Soviet 1983.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.100]   Everything done with bolts.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:28.220]   It's about the same size, shape, thickness, weight.
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.300]   It's just like a Dell SPS 13.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.020]   It's a 13-inch-- it's 3x2 screen, which I prefer.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:34.620]   I think they've done it.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:38.580]   And they have physical switches for the microphone
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.620]   and the camera.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.820]   So it's easy to--
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.900]   That's very big.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:42.980]   This is well thought out.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:46.740]   I mean, they're not using a core boot or anything like that.
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.260]   They're using a stock Intel processor and Intel BIOS.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:52.380]   But still, this is really impressive.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.460]   And it runs Linux perfectly, flawlessly,
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.380]   including the fingerprint reader.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.380]   So you could put windows on it.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.220]   You probably could hack and touch it.
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.700]   I think people are doing that.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.620]   I don't recommend that.
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.260]   But I'm very happy with it.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.100]   I'm curious about the--
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:10.020]   please, I'm very curious about the business model.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:10.740]   Because--
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.580]   Yeah, that's why I bought it.
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.460]   I wanted to support it.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:12.940]   It works out.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.940]   I really want to support them.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.020]   And wouldn't it be nice if two or three years down the line,
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.100]   like you've already been, oh, geez, I need more memory.
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:20.660]   You bought more memory.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:21.620]   Oh, geez, I need more storage.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.460]   I bought more storage.
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:23.740]   And then two or three years later--
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.140]   oh, wow, I actually now have a need for a really high power,
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.700]   high power 2025 level CPU.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.460]   And they can sell you a brand new motherboard.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.860]   That will be the test.
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.540]   In five years when I could take that motherboard out,
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:40.940]   put a new one in, they have to still be around, I admit.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.540]   And I can buy more RAM.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.340]   It's stock RAM.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.300]   It's stock hard drive.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:45.660]   It's a Western digital hard drive.
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.740]   But you could use anyone.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.460]   It's just M.2 and B.D. drive.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.420]   I like that it has essentially--
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.060]   if I understand it's correct--
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.700]   for internal USB-C ports.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.460]   But what connectors it actually plugs into
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.980]   are these pieces of Lego that you can just snap in.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.980]   So if you want it to be a display port,
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.820]   it could be a display port.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.340]   If you want it to be USB Type-A, it can be USB Type-A.
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.100]   That's exactly right.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.860]   I bought--
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:11.340]   So and I love that because I could have, as I do,
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:14.340]   a USB-C charging port on both sides.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.340]   So I got two USB-C modules.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:19.540]   They just-- little modules-- plug in a USB-A,
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.020]   because that still comes up for me in an HDMI port.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.420]   And I bought the DIY version.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.220]   So I did it all myself.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.860]   And it was trivially easy.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.820]   The only hard thing is putting in a Wi-Fi module,
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.420]   because you have to get the antennas and everything.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.300]   I think the most part is probably when they say in the
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.580]   quarterlies that they're talking about the problem with
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.140]   legacy components, I don't think there's going to be a lot
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:45.020]   of components that come out of the computer much longer.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.900]   I think Apple's getting is on the road to getting rid of
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.020]   everything that they don't have.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.540]   Yeah, but we talked about this before.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.820]   Now you have a choice.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.020]   You can get a highly proprietary but amazing M1
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:01.380]   Apple Silicon-based laptop with 12-hour battery life.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   Or you can opt for-- and I go back and forth, but I really
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:08.660]   love the idea of non-proprietary repairable openness.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.020]   I fix it, give framework 10 out of 10 on the
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:11.620]   repairability.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.020]   That's as good as you can go.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.820]   I always value my time.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.020]   Well, this didn't--
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   I like it.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.380]   I'm my Linux guy.
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:22.540]   I really do like it.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.740]   It would still be nice if Apple, even without getting
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.460]   pressure from regulators, if they decided that there was a
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:31.620]   time where they did not spend one minute out of every keynote
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.180]   talking about recyclability of components, how green these
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:34.820]   things are.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.140]   It would be nice if there were, as one of the
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.540]   parentheticals at the end of the big dog and pony show was--
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.860]   and by the way, this has got the highest
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.660]   repairability score and I fix it of any MacBook that we've ever
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.020]   sold.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.300]   OK, yes, it would be nice.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.140]   But still, the idea that they're thinking about this, and
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.740]   they're just thinking that, well, you know what, we don't
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:57.260]   actually have to put construction adhesive down to hold
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.540]   the battery, and so that the thing explodes if you try to
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.620]   replace the battery.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.460]   We decided that's kind of a jerk move, and maybe we can
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.980]   just let future generations replace a battery without
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:09.940]   losing their eyebrows.
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:12.700]   Well, you do have a choice, and I guess that's the point.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.500]   But I'm pretty sure that when they announced the 16-inch
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.420]   MacBook Pro with the M1X--
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.420]   The all-Vilcro edition.
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.820]   I will be in line to get one.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:29.580]   Apple is going to face a privacy lawsuit.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.780]   It's not just Apple, actually.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.660]   Everybody is going to face a privacy lawsuit.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:34.740]   This is for Syria.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:40.420]   Judge has ruled that Apple has to be faced nearly all of a
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.220]   post-class action lawsuit claiming that its voice
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:49.340]   activated Syria violates users' privacy because the plaintiff
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:53.140]   say it records private conversations due to accidental
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.220]   activations, and that those conversations are sent to
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.300]   third parties.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.740]   It's not just Apple.
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.460]   It's pretty much all three.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.980]   What about-- I think someone got convicted of--
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.140]   or whatever, at least in case for murder, or their Amazon,
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:07.740]   it wasn't Apple.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:08.540]   It was the Amazon--
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.540]   Right.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.940]   And so I think it gets complicated if it gets close.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:18.100]   And I will say that it's super weird when you're watching a
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.620]   movie and suddenly you hear Apple's device go, "Uh-huh?"
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.580]   All the time.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.300]   You're like, "It is."
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.660]   You're like, "Uh-huh."
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.460]   As there was some movie that just--
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.500]   there was somebody's name that activated it constantly.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.980]   And it was like, OK, that's super weird.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.940]   And we unplugged it because it was just like that's a--
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.420]   that's super weird that she just keeps on saying hi.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.380]   You can rename your echo Ziggy.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.660]   And I thought that was cool.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.860]   So I did.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.340]   And I still, because Apple has you say, hey first, everyone
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.020]   once in a while, I'll say hey Ziggy, and invariably
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.540]   Siri wakes up.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.020]   Right.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.660]   It's close enough.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:55.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.380]   It's tough.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:59.580]   The terms of this lawsuit are part of it is that, once
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:03.380]   again, there's the persistent belief that because I was--
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.300]   I had a private conversation with somebody on day one
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.900]   and on day two, I was getting ads for things
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.540]   that we talked about during the conversation.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.500]   The only way that they could have made that correlation
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:17.300]   is because the microphone was on and the phone was doing
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.860]   speech to text and transmitting information.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.620]   It's going to be a new level of scary when, in a court of law,
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.820]   as part of defending themselves from this suit,
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.260]   Google has to say, no, we're really just
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.380]   that good at figuring out via context what you might have
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.660]   talked about and what you might be interested in hearing
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.660]   right now.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:38.260]   We don't have to access the microphones.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.100]   Well, that's something I think Apple could demolish.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.500]   This is actually part of the Apple class action.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.700]   One Siri user said, his private discussions
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.700]   with his doctor about brand name surgical treatment
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.500]   caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.860]   Well, not only would you have to assume
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:56.020]   that Apple's listening and recording,
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:59.300]   but then they're passing it along because Apple doesn't do ads
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:27:59.900]   for you.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.700]   And the thing is that you went to the office of a specialist
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.620]   who distributes this drug.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.820]   There you go.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:11.180]   Like, OK, Google might have noticed that.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:15.420]   The other thing is that, for instance, if someone
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.820]   is searching a bunch of things and then
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:21.620]   becomes in your proximity, it can start inferring
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.580]   that you might be talking about things that they serve.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.100]   So it can draw those connections between individuals,
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:31.300]   your location, your doctor, the type of doctor,
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:36.380]   the type of things that all that data is all flowing around.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.380]   And so it doesn't need something silly,
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.580]   like listening to your conversation to understand
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.500]   what it needs to.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.460]   That's very interesting.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.460]   I've always skeptical when people say, no, no,
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.700]   I know it's listening to me because that's exactly
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.860]   what you're going to hear in the case.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:52.580]   But it's good that people learn how these things work.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:56.420]   I mean, it's like solving an equation with 54 variables.
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:59.460]   And even if they're, oh, well, geez, with 54 unknown variables,
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.620]   they can't solve this equation.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:03.820]   Yeah, but they have 200 pieces of data
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.380]   that they can use to try to solve for those 54 different
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:06.900]   variables.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:07.900]   They're going to get it.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:10.220]   The judge said plaintiffs could pursue claims
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:13.380]   that Apple violated the Federal Wiretap Act,
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:16.860]   California privacy law, and committed breach of contract.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.780]   He did throw out, and I'm not sure,
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.580]   an unfair competition claim.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.700]   I don't know where that--
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.220]   OK.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.540]   Just by default.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:27.700]   His finger slipped.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:30.100]   When he was typing Apple and Google, it's about, oh,
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.100]   I trust.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.500]   Oh, damn, you think they're even printed?
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.660]   Oh, well, well.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.300]   I do think that the wiretapping thing is a little complicated
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.020]   for all of these services.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.620]   Because they are recording, and they're not announcing it.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.460]   And the question is, is do you assume when you put one in,
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:47.220]   he starts talking to it, are you assuming you're
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.180]   losing some privacy or the ability for it to do that?
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.620]   And I don't know if you do, but I think that any--
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.100]   like, I do.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:58.580]   I don't put my smart assistance everywhere in my house.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:02.100]   So there's places that I prefer not to have an assistant
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.980]   in mine or all in the kitchen.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:08.580]   So maybe not be better in talking while I'm cooking.
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:14.300]   But anyway, so I think that it's an interesting problem
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:15.740]   of recording, because in most states,
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.980]   it's illegal to record without telling somebody.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.780]   That's the--
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.420]   --that is a clear angle.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.420]   I do think that the main solution to this
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.020]   is going to be transparency.
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.580]   That one thing that Google is second only
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.980]   to the Antichrist itself when it comes to collecting
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.180]   people's personal data.
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:33.980]   However, they're also very good in saying,
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   if you want to see every recording we've ever
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.500]   made from your smart device, here it is.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.900]   Not only that, but you can actually
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.380]   listen to the recording itself.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.500]   So if you are shocked, horrified,
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.860]   and you want to throw our devices in a fire,
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.580]   you are now free to do that, and/or delete all this stuff
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.380]   that we have actually collected from you.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.700]   So there are things you can't really
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.620]   make a smart assistant that is so good at discerning
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.180]   the hot word from something that's
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.220]   kind of has the same musical sense as the hot word,
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.700]   particularly given that you've got this tiny, tiny low power
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.860]   system on a chip that's responsible for that,
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.140]   and nothing else than that.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.300]   But people have to know if you're going to be--
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.860]   if you can't just simply blindly trust any company,
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.740]   be it Google, be it Apple, be it Amazon, be it anybody,
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.620]   you have to understand exactly what's
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.180]   involved in the transaction so that you can decide
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.020]   what your Iq factor is.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:22.820]   And it's not just--
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.300]   it's not just the data that they're
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.100]   collecting, it's the data that they're buying.
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.420]   So they're constantly buying--
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:31.420]   they're buying your data from the television that you bought.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.340]   They're buying data from the Safeway
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.420]   that you went to shop in.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.180]   They're buying data from the credit cards.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.060]   That's why all those GDPR things are big deals.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.340]   Like, can we sell your data?
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:41.340]   What are they doing?
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.540]   They're packaging that data up and selling it back
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.580]   to Google and Facebook so they can get a better trajectory.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.340]   So all of those things are things that they're--
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.020]   all of those things they're collecting,
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.900]   and the stuff that they're collecting directly
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:53.940]   is what they tell you.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:59.460]   Do you think Apple is not collecting it and not passing it on?
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:31:59.940]   I don't know.
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:00.980]   No, Apple's not passing it on.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.260]   They're not passing it on.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:06.140]   Apple would-- the only reason that they would keep the data
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.820]   is so they can figure out why it said that,
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.380]   so they can improve the trajectory.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.820]   But they have no reason to keep it.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:13.100]   They don't want to.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.220]   Let's take a little break.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:14.980]   More to come.
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:19.700]   Alex Lindsay's here from Office Hours, Office Hours.global.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.420]   Alex, I'm sure you've got some exciting stuff
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.540]   you're covering when I give us a little plug.
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.940]   I mean, we're just having so much fun with it.
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.620]   It was a long day on Saturday.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:33.460]   We went 11 hours of the regular show.
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.060]   And then we had the after hours, because we
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.460]   started with the regular show.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:38.380]   And then we have two hours where we talk--
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.140]   we have educators.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.700]   People in the-- and it's becoming more and more
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.180]   administrators and teachers and everything else.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.060]   And we don't stream that.
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.540]   So you can't see it because they felt like they didn't want
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:48.020]   to put it on.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:48.540]   Good.
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.040]   Good.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:49.700]   So there's a lot of--
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.660]   Conversations like, OK, so how does--
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:55.060]   like, we're having conversations on Saturday mornings about,
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:59.260]   well, how does online learning affect the financial models
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:03.060]   of the traditional brick and mortar schools?
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.460]   And what does that mean?
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.980]   And what's sustainable?
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:08.780]   And so you get into these really deep conversations
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:09.620]   on Saturday morning.
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.100]   So then came out of that.
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.940]   And we have this thing that we're calling the Belfast Project,
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.660]   because we started in a bar in Belfast,
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:19.140]   or not Belfast Project, but it's called the Belfast Method.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.100]   We changed the way the Belfast Project is something else
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.340]   that we decided not to use.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:25.900]   So the Belfast Method is--
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.420]   There is no Belfast Project.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.140]   Forget, I ever said Belfast Project.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.220]   The Belfast Project and the Belfast Project
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.460]   is related to the troubles.
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.700]   And so we decided to change it to the Belfast Method.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.100]   That's smart.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.540]   Anyway, so anyway, what we're figuring out
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:42.780]   is how do you run a show?
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.580]   And in this case, there was an artist taught around onto it
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.740]   we worked with in the past.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:51.260]   And we're taking over his switcher and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.620]   People all over the world are running his show,
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.620]   giving these houses, remotely.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.940]   And so everyone's figuring it out.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.460]   You get to watch and listen to the comms.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.020]   And they're streaming it to YouTube.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:01.740]   And you get to see all the stuff that's there.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.980]   And then, of course, we shifted gears again.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.540]   I mean, there's really good lentil cake.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.660]   It's amazing.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:09.140]   So good.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.860]   There's me following along and trying to figure it out.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.500]   And so DeMiente Gajar, who's in South Africa,
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:19.820]   she's teaching us how to make this lentil dish that
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.700]   was amazing.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.140]   And it took us like two hours.
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:23.900]   We put this all together.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:24.500]   We made that.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.420]   It was probably the Indian cooking.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.540]   It's very labor intensive.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.980]   Well, I have to admit that we got about halfway through.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:37.500]   And we had done the lentils and the onions and everything else.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.020]   And I was like, I could just eat this as a soup.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.820]   You know, it would have stopped now.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.220]   It was like this purring.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.420]   I was like, this is fine right here.
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:45.140]   And then we kept going.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.380]   And it was even better.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.260]   Anyway, and then we switched to the remote,
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.820]   which the remotes is our own band.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:53.460]   So anyway, so they had a new song.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.260]   You got to cut, rename this Sabado Gigantico, I think.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.140]   But the thing is that we finished all of those things.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:03.260]   We finished about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.860]   It started at 5 in the morning.
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.780]   And so--
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.580]   4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.700]   And then we went to after hours.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.500]   And then people were talking into the evening
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.300]   and hanging out talking about stuff.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.260]   So the big thing is that we're just--
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.020]   it's so amazing that there's so much information going back
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:23.060]   and forth because the folks that are in office hours
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:27.900]   are getting smarter, but also the kind of folks that
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.260]   are continually coming in.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.860]   I don't know if you know what a flame is.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.660]   Do you know what a flame is?
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.460]   Leo?
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.060]   I don't know.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.260]   Flame lies in flame wars or--
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.860]   Oh, no, Autodix makes a pro--
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:40.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:40.760]   Flame.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.260]   Yeah, we used to use Flame at Tech TV.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.180]   It was--
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:43.620]   It looks--
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.260]   In the day, a very expensive graphics of Xbox.
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.180]   You're hanging out with us.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:51.180]   And we were like, what do you do during the day?
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.540]   It's like, I'm a flame operator.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.540]   Wow.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.820]   And so-- but it's like that, oh, I'm working on--
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.580]   we had a whole bunch of people working at the Olympics.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.700]   And so they come back.
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.420]   And we learn a bunch of stuff.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:03.540]   And so there's people working in broadcast.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:04.900]   But there's also just--
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.300]   there's literally-- and then there's
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.700]   all these teachers that are coming in.
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.100]   They're asking technical questions
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.740]   with folks that have a lot of technical background.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.220]   But they're bringing this perspective of teaching.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.660]   And then we have people who are teaching us how to cook.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.940]   So it's a very interesting community that--
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.060]   People still use Flame.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.580]   I thought it was completely--
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.340]   No, it's software-alting.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:25.700]   No, it's still--
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:26.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.420]   It used to be hardware, didn't it?
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.620]   It's very powerful.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:31.300]   And it's still out there.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.220]   And it's still--
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.460]   they've moved to a subscription model like everybody else.
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.740]   But the subscription model for Flame
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:40.140]   is $12,000 a year.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.340]   If you need it, you know.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.980]   And the Inako is also with us, of course, from WGBH
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:51.620]   and places West and East and North and South.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.180]   When are you going to be on GBAH next?
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:57.500]   Friday at 12.30 in the afternoon.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.780]   But I have to ask Alex, to satisfy curiosity,
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.820]   who was the first one to get an office hours tattoo
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.100]   and where was it?
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.060]   You don't have them yet.
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.220]   We're working on it.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.580]   It's not a thing to finalize the logo.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.100]   But there's a lot of--
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.460]   I'm telling you, you got it.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.700]   I don't think Saburo Gigatico is available.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.300]   You should just rename the whole thing.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:16.820]   No.
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:18.820]   I don't know the title.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.580]   Oh my god.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.700]   Search on YouTube.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.580]   Saburo Gigante International is this--
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:25.660]   I don't want to agree with you.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.620]   --like variety show that is the most--
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:31.580]   all they want to do is make sure that everybody has fun,
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:36.220]   no matter what expense to the hosts or the staff's personal--
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.140]   It ran for 53 years.
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.980]   It ended in 2015.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.580]   It was long, as I remember, was many hours of a Saturday.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:45.060]   Exactly.
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.060]   It was very much like what you're doing here.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.180]   They pumped pure oxygen to the studio all the time.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:50.860]   Saburo--
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:52.700]   If you have gante, that's it.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.980]   You've got any golfs?
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.860]   I used to watch it with my dad all the time,
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:59.780]   because it was like one of the few intersections of our TV tastes.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.100]   Saburo Lante International.
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.580]   I didn't really understand the language,
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.300]   but you could tell they were having fun.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:07.820]   That was the--
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:08.140]   Joy.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   That was the main point.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:09.620]   Exactly.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:10.340]   Right.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340]   Everything.
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:12.020]   Everything.
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:17.700]   It was like every TV show ever in one.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.780]   Fab 52 year old man in a diaper.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:21.300]   Yep.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.060]   Go ahead.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:22.820]   A baby bottle.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.300]   Yep.
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.380]   There you go.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.900]   It's like we talked about media and education and everything else,
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.660]   but I got up a couple mornings ago,
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.100]   and I was like, because I turn it on when I'm making my coffee
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.220]   and everything else, and someone was there,
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.380]   troubleshooting a router.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.700]   Like, you know, but like--
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.020]   Sure.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:37.420]   Someone's got a router in there.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:38.260]   Oh, sure.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.140]   Trying to figure out why it's not passing data.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:41.700]   It was amazing.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.100]   It's all right.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:43.700]   All right.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.180]   Our show today brought to you by--
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:46.900]   let me see here.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.620]   Oh, AT&T.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.100]   If there are friends and family members you haven't talked to
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.780]   in a wild, oh, don't worry.
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.380]   It's never too late to reconnect,
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:59.460]   to help AT&T is offering deals on the latest smartphones.
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:38:59.960]   Hmm.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.020]   Wonder what those could be.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.260]   It's not complicated.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.540]   Everyone deserves something new,
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:07.820]   so AT&T is giving new and existing customers their best
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:11.100]   deals on every smartphone, even the latest ones.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.020]   Restrictions and exceptions may apply visit att.com for details.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:20.300]   We thanks AT&T for their support.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:20.700]   All right.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.180]   We should talk about this, because really, I kind of buried
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.540]   the lead, the big-- really, the two big stories of the week.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:31.700]   Apple has delayed the rollout of their child pornography,
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.500]   detection system, and the child safety features,
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:39.300]   all three features that they announced with some fanfare
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.460]   and a lot of criticism last month.
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.740]   In a statement of 9 to 5 Mac, they said, last month,
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:47.020]   we announced plans for features intended
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.180]   to help protect children from predators who
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.780]   use communications tools to recruit and exploit them
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:54.540]   and limit the spread of child sexual abuse material
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:59.060]   based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.020]   researchers, and others.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.580]   We have decided to take additional time over the coming
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:06.100]   months to collect input and make improvements
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.340]   before releasing these critically important child
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.740]   safety features.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.780]   They blamed for them.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.380]   Yeah, again, good for them.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.380]   That's not something we normally associate with Apple.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.060]   We associate with them with sticking to their guns
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:22.940]   for a time and then quietly backing down
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:25.500]   when the marketplace tells them, no, no, hell no.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.820]   But the fact that it's sort of like when
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.260]   was the old quote that when Nixon realized
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.980]   that he'd lost Walter Cronkite, he realized
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:35.300]   he lost the presidency, Apple realized
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:38.660]   that so many advocacy groups for privacy and security
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:41.740]   that have almost impeccable credentials
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.180]   were still not just-- they weren't
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.060]   saying that, oh, we're concerned about this.
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.140]   They were still vehemently against it.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:51.540]   And they realized that either that gave them
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.420]   a sort of a come to God moment of, oh, maybe we should back off
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:55.420]   and rethink this.
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.100]   Maybe we did have a strong attitude.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.180]   Or just simply realizing that we are not
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.260]   going to be able to move forward with this unless we have
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:03.340]   signed in from these outside agencies
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:05.340]   because their opinions have a lot of weight
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.380]   and they definitely matter.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.180]   It is the case that the National Center for Missing
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:12.300]   and Exploid children in a revealed private memo to Apple
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:17.060]   said, don't listen to those shrieking voices.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.260]   They knew there would be heat on this.
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:25.260]   Do you think Apple is going to rethink it or drop it?
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.100]   I think that they're going to--
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.140]   I don't think they're going to drop it
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.700]   because it's an important consideration.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:34.540]   They can do a lot of good by putting these kind of protections
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:35.060]   in.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.140]   I wouldn't be surprised if they reintroduced it
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:40.460]   and simply remove the on-device component of it.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.660]   Even when they were doing damage control
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.140]   and Craig Fitteregge was giving one-to-one interviews
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.180]   with lots of people, he still did not
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.940]   have a good explanation for why is it
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.460]   that doing this on-device is more safe, more secure, more
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.300]   private than doing it once these pictures appear
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:41:59.540]   on iCloud servers.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:02.460]   He was trying to make the case explicitly that, oh, well,
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:08.900]   geez, Google Photos scans every single photo that
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.100]   is on this server.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:13.620]   We're only scanning the photos that people are choosing to upload,
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.540]   not taking--
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.500]   either he was speaking too fast, really,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:21.500]   appreciate that he was saying that this is exactly the exact same
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   thing, that every single photo that goes
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:27.700]   onto that server is scanned before it is sort of accepted
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.180]   to cloud.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.900]   Had they done what Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Dropbox
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:34.660]   already do, scan stuff stored on their servers,
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:37.220]   I don't think they would have gotten the same heat.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.300]   Yeah, I don't think any of us would have been freaking out
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:41.940]   about it.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:45.220]   It was putting it on the phone that was the problem.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:51.020]   And also, I'm still surprised that boy did they just step
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.220]   on a rake jumping off of a ladder with both feet the way
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:54.980]   they introduced this.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:58.100]   They allowed the story to get ahead of them.
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.900]   They're so vague about what they were about to do
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.700]   that they really allowed a lot of concerned people to say,
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.460]   wait, are you saying that every photo that's on my device
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.620]   is going to be scanned for potential child-endangering
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:11.300]   material?
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:14.820]   Because if that's so, I'm setting fire to my iPhone right now.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.620]   And later on, they realized that, oh, we needed to explain
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.580]   in detail exactly what it is that we're doing that,
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.300]   no, there are two separate components.
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.460]   Excuse me, there are three separate components to this.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.860]   We are not turning our Apple Smart Speakers
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:29.940]   into tattle tails on what's going on inside your house.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:33.540]   No, we are not searching every single picture that comes in
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:36.620]   through iMessage for child-endangering material
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.540]   that needs to be reported to police.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:43.060]   No, we are not turning your phone into an active warrantless
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:46.700]   search for possible evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.740]   Here is what we're doing.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:52.820]   There are three separate firewall, different things
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.260]   that are happening for three different sorts of things.
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.380]   And again, they're doing what they're
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:01.580]   trying to accomplish is overdue and does a very important thing.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:04.900]   But once again, I think they're used to thinking in a vacuum.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.140]   They're also, I think, was--
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:08.460]   I might even have been Renee who first suggested this when
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.060]   we were talking about this a month ago--
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.220]   that their dogma, their corporate mentality
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:16.420]   is that anything that you do on the device and not
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:19.780]   in the cloud is by nature more private and more secure
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:21.700]   than something that happens on a server.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.980]   And that might have tripped them up into thinking that,
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:26.060]   no, of course, if we're going to be scanning stuff,
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.700]   we should be scanning it before it goes onto our servers
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.420]   and not after it lands on the servers.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:35.700]   And I think that one of the FBI big things
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.940]   that they keep on talking about is child pornography.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:40.140]   So it's like this sore little thing
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.700]   that they keep on jabbing Apple with,
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.020]   we have to have access to the phone.
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:44.140]   We have to have access to the phone.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.500]   They keep on jabbing Apple about it.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.740]   So Apple tries to do something about it.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:52.020]   And it's just with the content that everyone is against
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.220]   or almost everybody's against.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.340]   You know, content--
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.900]   No, let's stipulate now.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:58.180]   Every-- we all agree.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:44:59.620]   Reproable or--
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:01.180]   It's obvious somebody doing it.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.380]   So they're not against it.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:02.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.500]   But everybody we know is against it.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.300]   By the way, anybody who wanted to do it
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.980]   was given fair warning for my Apple
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:10.420]   and knows how to not get in trouble with Apple.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:13.180]   So I don't think this would have had much effect either.
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.260]   But I would be surprised.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:15.900]   No.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.060]   The pushback, I think it might be a long time,
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.780]   like years before they come back to it.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.500]   You know, it's one of those things that--
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.020]   This is the face-saving way of saying,
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.500]   "Hey, we're going to take-- we're going to study some more
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.100]   and then they're going to study some more next spring
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:27.900]   and then they're going to hope that no one talks about it again."
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.540]   As Gruber pointed out, this is--
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.940]   You can say that Apple did the right thing.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.820]   They didn't just ship it.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:39.900]   They told people and they let the conversation begin.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.700]   They heard the screeching voices of the minority.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.580]   That was the term the neck mech folks used.
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:48.660]   And listened to them and said, "Okay, fine.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.460]   I wonder if they'll come back."
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.820]   My thought is--
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:54.660]   I'm not going to confirm by any information from Apple,
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.980]   but that Apple was about to release end-to-end encryption
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.020]   on iCloud and said, "Before we do that,
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.180]   we've got to give a SOP to law enforcement.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.660]   And so we have to announce this technology that will--
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.380]   And that's why they did it pre-uploading it.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.900]   They're not going to scan the iCloud
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.340]   because they want that to be fully encrypted.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:15.700]   So they scan it on your phone.
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.980]   They still think they are scanning the iCloud.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.220]   No, they're scanning the cloud right now.
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:21.900]   Are they already doing that?
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.100]   No. They're doing some stuff.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.100]   I think the only thing they're scanning is mail.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:29.460]   I don't think they're scanning iCloud Photos content.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:32.900]   Google stands mail with the neck mech database.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.940]   Right, exactly.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:34.940]   And Google Drive.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:39.180]   And also remember that iCloud backups aren't encrypted anyway,
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.140]   or rather Apple has-- Apple will--
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.740]   They're encrypted with Apple data.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:43.700]   Right, exactly.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.300]   So Apple will with the right--
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.620]   So if you present the right paperwork--
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:50.980]   A few months ago, Apple, supposedly, the story
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:53.700]   was about to roll out end-to-end encryption
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.220]   and was talked out of it by law enforcement.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.180]   They've wanted to do-- because if you end-to-end--
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.500]   with the San Bernardino shooter, they told the FBI,
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.180]   we're not going to help you decrypt the phone
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.020]   because the phone is sacrosanct.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:10.340]   But if you had just taken the phone back to his premises
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:11.780]   and let it upload to iCloud, we'd
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:14.380]   have been glad to hand you everything that was on iCloud.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.460]   But Apple doesn't want to be in that position.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:20.100]   So it's my opinion that this was in order to get end-to-end
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:24.020]   encryption to be somewhat acceptable law enforcement.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.420]   They had to do this.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.740]   But what they miss--
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:30.740]   I think they underestimated how people would feel about this
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:33.100]   scanning happening on the phone.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.100]   They don't want it going on.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:37.260]   I think also, though, if law enforcement--
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.980]   the one thing that it does point out
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:40.940]   is that if law enforcement thinks that people are going
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.380]   to be OK with back doors to the phone,
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:47.300]   this is the worst kind of content possible.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.380]   It's there and there against it.
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.460]   They're going to be against everything else.
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.380]   You can be-- so if law enforcement-- maybe
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:56.100]   it's a good communication to law enforcement, like, hey,
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.660]   we're really serious about this because it
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.300]   is completely indefensible content.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.660]   And we're still like we don't want you on the phone.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.260]   And so I think that it's going to be very difficult
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.140]   for law enforcement.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.860]   I think in some ways it strengthens
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.940]   Apple's discussion with law enforcement of, hey,
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.700]   people are really not interested in this.
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:17.340]   You know?
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.180]   Well, there's also the question that now Apple has said
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:25.020]   we could do it if countries, including the US,
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.860]   aren't going to come to them and say, hey, you told us you
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.940]   could do it, you've got to do it.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.980]   And I could see China, Russia, Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:34.340]   I can see them absolutely.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:37.260]   So I think the cat is not out of the bag,
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.260]   but you're hanging on with the back leg now
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.140]   to get struggling.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:41.260]   You know, like it's--
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.300]   That's the hard part.
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:47.060]   This is going to-- I won't turn this into a whole thing,
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:50.140]   but this is a problem that's going to get bigger and bigger
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.540]   and bigger.
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.500]   Within the next five years, Apple and Google
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.580]   and all these other companies are
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:57.740]   going to have their first big test case where
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.500]   government orders them to do something that they are going
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:05.780]   to absolutely-- that would absolutely render their product
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.380]   horrible to all of their users.
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.180]   And they're going to have to ask, is it OK if I say no
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:15.060]   to this market simply because China is asking us to do something
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:18.220]   that is completely 100% counter to everything
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.380]   that we've ever stood for?
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:23.220]   And it's going to happen sooner rather than later.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.020]   And I hope it doesn't happen first in the United States
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:30.740]   where there's a, as Alex is saying, a law requiring
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.340]   a backdoor into phones.
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.740]   All we're looking for-- all we're waiting for
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:38.180]   is the wrong sort of presidential administration
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:42.420]   to get a second term before that becomes a really, really
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.220]   big threat that it's--
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:45.740]   It's going to happen in Australia.
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.100]   It's happened in England.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.700]   It's probably going to happen in Canada.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:50.940]   It's happening all around us.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.020]   The Five Eyes are doing it.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.540]   I think it's going to happen.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.580]   The intelligence agencies are just--
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:01.500]   I mean, and again, in defense of the intelligence agencies,
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:06.740]   they keep the fact that we don't have to have AK-47s
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:07.460]   on every corner.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.580]   And we don't have walls around our house.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.660]   I work in countries where we do.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.180]   And that happens all the time.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:15.140]   And the reason is because they're quietly
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:18.780]   cleaning things up around us with all this data.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.740]   So there is a reason for that data to exist.
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:21.940]   I don't want to say that it doesn't.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:25.100]   At the same time, we do have to set some limits
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:25.860]   to what we're doing.
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:28.660]   And for them, they're only interested in what happens
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:31.980]   is in a meeting in DC or Langley or whatever,
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.300]   they're getting blamed for the next terrorist act.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:36.340]   They don't get to give excuses of, well,
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.500]   we can't get into the phone and we can't do this.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.380]   It's all their fault.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:41.980]   It's an intelligence failure.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.940]   It's a blah, blah, blah, all those things.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.820]   And so all they care about is making sure
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.140]   that they provide absolute--
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.380]   it's close to absolute safety as they can.
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.460]   And getting into the phone is part of that equation.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.460]   And so I understand where they're coming from,
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.100]   but at the same time on our side.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:00.060]   You know, we are--
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.700]   we're going to reach a pretty complicated time
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.380]   for governments because they're becoming less important.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.020]   And they're going to thrash.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.780]   And we don't want to be--
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:11.380]   we need to be able to protect ourselves from the governments
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.500]   because they're going to thrash as the nation states
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.340]   start to unwind.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.860]   Because they're just not--
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.500]   they don't mean as much as they used to.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.940]   And that's going to be problematic.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.060]   And as citizens in these countries,
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.540]   we have to know that we cannot just trust our government
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:26.500]   to protect us.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.820]   And we have to do that ourselves with our privacy.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.100]   And to put a button on it, we also
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.780]   shouldn't leave without acknowledging
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:40.460]   that the trafficking of abuse material against children
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.380]   has not been increasing in an incremental way.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:46.900]   It has been increasing by larger and larger leaps every year,
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:50.340]   largely because of savvy traffickers
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:52.100]   know how to do it without getting caught.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:54.620]   Even one of the most surprising statistics here
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.460]   is that the easiest way to get caught
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.060]   is to use Facebook to exchange this material.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:02.580]   And even Facebook is getting more than tens and tens
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:06.780]   of millions of reports that they're making to law enforcement
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:09.300]   on this age and every year is just getting worse and worse.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.060]   So there might actually become a point in which we
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:13.700]   revisit this as a culture and decide
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:19.660]   that here is where we're willing to weaken a little bit
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:24.300]   in order to stem what we see as a much bigger problem than law
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.300]   enforcement being able to peek at our phones.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.500]   I don't see it right now.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.340]   But if things keep getting worse and worse and worse,
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:32.460]   where it becomes impossible to prosecute somebody
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:36.660]   for some of these horrible crime because of limitations made
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.340]   by tech.
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:40.340]   And if researchers, I'm saying independent researchers
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:42.540]   with no skin in the game, say that actually we
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:45.460]   think we have a system that will actually work.
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.180]   So long as there's a legal framework
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:51.540]   that firewalls around it to protect it from being misused,
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:53.420]   we should at least be willing to listen
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.180]   and have that discussion at least.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.580]   All it's going to take is--
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.620]   here we are in the 20th anniversary of 9/11.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:01.500]   All it's going to take is another line 11 and it's over.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.580]   And I think that that's inevitable, to be honest with you.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:09.420]   It's between terrorism and child pornography, law enforcement.
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:12.180]   And I agree with you 100% Alex.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.940]   They're doing it out of a patriarchal desire
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.900]   to protect children and to protect all of us.
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.540]   So I don't think they're evil.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:22.700]   But I also understand how we put everything in this phone.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:25.220]   This phone is a new concept.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.820]   You notice that--
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:29.580]   tell us agencies aren't complaining about Facebook.
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:31.380]   Yo, they love Facebook.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.820]   They love Facebook.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:33.620]   Are complaining about it?
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.380]   Don't say it's--
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:36.380]   CIA is a big investor in Facebook.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.300]   Are you kidding?
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.540]   There are not a lot of comments there
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.780]   because it's super useful.
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.380]   Johnny Law loves the Ring Doorbell.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.580]   They think they should be sold for $18 each.
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:49.860]   If everybody could have a Ring Doorbell on their doorframe,
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.420]   boy, wouldn't that be wonderful?
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.220]   Well, privacy advocates are going crazy right now
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.740]   because proton mail handed over the IP address.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:58.820]   They had a climate activist in France.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.620]   Everybody thought they were secure there.
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.900]   Hey, by the way, just a tip.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.180]   You're not secure if you're using email period.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.420]   At least metadata is leaked.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:14.060]   And then there's a pro-publicist story about WhatsApp.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.580]   Actually, having 1,000 employees monitoring
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.300]   the content of messages.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:20.460]   What's apps denying this?
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:22.900]   But we'll see.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.380]   We'll see.
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:23.860]   I don't know.
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.060]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:29.100]   I think the smart thing to do would be to assume you're not
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:29.580]   private.
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:31.580]   And if you are a dissident in the country,
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.820]   we're at that's a dangerous thing to be,
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:37.740]   you really need to learn your security--
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:41.180]   your ops sec-- and you've got to be very careful.
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:44.020]   And to say, oh, I'm using an iPhone, I'm safe.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.820]   It's clearly a mistake.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.180]   And just if you're an activist, just remember that the NSA
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.060]   lost a lot of stuff.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.540]   Yeah, everybody does.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:54.140]   Yeah, it's a job.
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:56.780]   So we need to keep in mind, it's a pretty--
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.300]   you have to be really, really careful with any electronic
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.740]   device, anything electronic once you do that.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.500]   And in general, I mean, so much stuff.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:07.260]   You only say if you're both naked in a field more than 100
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.980]   meters from the nearest person, then go ahead.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:10.780]   Have a good time.
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:14.700]   I think it's not a reality show on the Discovery Channel.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:20.060]   It turns out that whole show is all about case officers.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:25.420]   Apple has also started to give ground in its App Store rules.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:30.100]   CNBC says, the Apple strategy to fight off antitrust regulators
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.740]   fix the App Store one rule at a time.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.460]   I can't say I disagree.
[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:39.340]   They've been bit by bit, inch by inch concessions.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:43.820]   I'm sure Apple doesn't want to give any of these.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:49.020]   So the concession in this case is a benefit, I think,
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:53.220]   to some, particularly the biggest--
[01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:57.300]   I mean, the smallest companies, just like the 15%--
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:01.180]   the cut for a sub $1 million companies.
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:02.500]   So what have they agreed to?
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:03.540]   I have to--
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:06.700]   It's another-- they've been consistent
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.460]   saying that it turns out that they're
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.420]   willing to concede on the idea of Apple as the exclusive payment
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.100]   processor for purchases.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.620]   And this is, I believe, just another hook at that.
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:20.100]   They've already lost in South Korea.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.060]   Right?
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.100]   And--
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.620]   It's been a last week.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:27.260]   But it seems that's not a really big problem for them.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:30.860]   It also is, from a PR perspective, when
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.940]   they're trying to fight this fight, they can say, OK, well,
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:36.180]   you know, little developers that are making $8,000 a year.
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:39.700]   If you want to track all the international expenses
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.940]   and all the international taxes going everywhere yourself,
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.140]   you're fine to do that.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:44.980]   Of course, we'd be happy to do that for you
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:46.580]   if you use us as your payment processor.
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:50.820]   The change doesn't affect the big money game companies.
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:52.100]   And that's the real thing.
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:54.460]   Epic still is going to have to use Apple's store.
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:57.500]   But Apple did agree to allow some company spot
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:59.260]   a fine Netflix to--
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:01.380]   In quote unquote, "reading app applications."
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.580]   Reading, yeah, can all your Mac themes and--
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:08.340]   To say, hey, you could buy this somewhere else.
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:12.540]   You no longer have to pretend that there is no world outside
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.700]   of the Apple App Store, which is--
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.820]   we consider that we're considering this a victory
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:19.300]   that they have decided that it's OK for them
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:23.300]   to modify the most ridiculous terms in the App Store
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:24.060]   agreement.
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.020]   Like, OK, I mean, it's--
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:27.700]   Here's Phil Schiller's--
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:29.180]   Foot of Land is one foot of land.
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:29.620]   But OK.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.660]   His Phil Schiller's statement, the change
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:34.980]   will help developers of reader apps
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.260]   make it easier for users to set up and manage their apps
[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:41.140]   and services while protecting their privacy
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:42.580]   and maintaining their trust.
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:44.420]   The Apple's going to underline that privacy.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:47.660]   Well, I think that the thing that they've done
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:50.700]   is the numbers for Apple are almost zero.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:53.140]   I mean, like, these companies aren't making any money.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:53.940]   And so the--
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:55.580]   Well, Netflix is--
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:57.100]   So when you're supposed to read it,
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.580]   but they already did that deal.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:01.180]   Like, Spotify's making some money.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.700]   But for the most part, these readers are not making that money.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:06.260]   They're not going to really change Apple's numbers
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:07.420]   that heavily.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.980]   The big thing, though, is that they're
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:11.100]   going to be the most annoying about it,
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.820]   because this is a market that is shrinking quickly.
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.900]   And so the thing is that they're going to be, OK,
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.500]   now we finally get information from the user
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:18.900]   where you start sending emails.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:21.260]   And then users are going to get a preview of what this
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.220]   is going to be like if it opens up everywhere.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.860]   And they're not going to be happy about it.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.100]   They're not going to--
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.780]   One thing I want to not clear about in this announcement
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:30.380]   is whether they're going to opt in or opt out.
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:32.980]   I think that the user should have to opt in.
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:36.340]   To say, I'm OK with being contacted by folks
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.780]   through my email, because right now it appears that it's opt out.
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:43.420]   So and I think the user should be allowed to say that immediately.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.820]   Well, I don't know if it's email.
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:48.500]   It says they'll be permitted to include a link within the app
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.740]   to directly set up or manage their account.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:53.580]   There's access to-- I believe that there's access
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:55.420]   to being able to email them through there.
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:58.020]   This has always been a complaint from many developers
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:02.100]   is that Apple holds on tight to who my subscriber is.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.700]   And so maybe they're going to get some-- yeah,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:06.700]   I guess it would have that effect if you exit out
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.100]   to the website that Nanao--
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.180]   I can tell you--
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:13.540]   The first developer that emails me that I didn't ask for,
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:14.740]   I'll be the end of that app.
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:15.580]   I get so much junk mail.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:18.780]   Don't you get so much junk mail that it's useless to even
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:19.500]   think about that?
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.260]   I mean--
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:20.900]   Get frustrated.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.660]   I just get frustrated with people adding more.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.260]   Like I just-- I do admit that I get a ton of junk mail.
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:27.340]   But I just-- like I have all these filters.
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:29.420]   And if you start-- if you add another one
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:31.180]   and I have to add another filter at this point,
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.860]   I'm constantly-- like every day I'm
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.980]   unsubscribing from something.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:34.980]   I just--
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:35.460]   No, no.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.020]   That's just a--
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.940]   I will just say that it's more important for me
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:40.500]   with the smaller developers than it is with the larger ones
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.860]   because the chances are that the company that makes Downey,
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:46.740]   my video downloader, I like what they do.
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:47.660]   It's a great tool.
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.820]   I'm very happy to support them.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:51.740]   If they have a new tool that complements the Downey
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:54.420]   tool very well, I absolutely want to know about it.
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:57.220]   If it's a game company, if it's a--
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.500]   a lot of companies, I like their house style.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.940]   I like their attitude.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:01.740]   I like their approach.
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:03.780]   And if they have other projects, it's very likely
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:05.980]   I'm going to want to learn about them as well.
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.900]   So in that case, absolutely not.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.180]   I would be very, very pleased for them
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:10.580]   to be able to contact me directly with it.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.100]   No, I think they should be able to contact you if you opt in.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:14.380]   I just don't think that they should suddenly--
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:15.100]   I don't agree.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:16.260]   I've got a lot of apps.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:18.580]   And I'm not that interested in being contacted by all of them.
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.180]   I mean, there's a handful of them, to your point,
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:21.780]   Downey, by the way, is a great app.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:27.900]   But like, you know, like, Kingdom Rush, you know,
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:30.420]   which is my little game, they send me little things all the time
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.980]   about new things I can buy.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:32.700]   And I try not to.
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.700]   That's their business model, man.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:36.500]   It works, but they don't send me emails.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:37.660]   I open the app down.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.540]   I'm already there.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:39.140]   What heroes?
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:40.340]   And I'm like, ooh, OK.
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:45.220]   Data point, don't know what it means.
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:48.420]   Rogamiba, which makes an app called Fission,
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.340]   which we've recommended.
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:52.900]   It's been an app pick of the week on this show.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:57.140]   He's pulling it off the Mac App Store.
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:59.260]   They're going to start selling it directly, no longer
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:02.940]   through the Mac App Store, because they
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:06.180]   say that the App Store, for almost 20 years,
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:09.100]   we've sold our software directly to our customers, they say,
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:11.420]   via our online store.
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.820]   Since the Mac App Store opened in 2011,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:14.820]   we've experimented there.
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:17.300]   However, despite a decade of feedback
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:19.500]   from countless developers and users,
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:22.140]   Apple has made scant few changes,
[02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:25.020]   and the store remains beset with issues.
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.100]   And when you couple the many shortcomings and issues
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:30.220]   with Apple's restrictive policies that preclude most
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.760]   of our software from appearing there,
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.260]   Rogamiba software often works at a low level of the system
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.140]   that App Store doesn't want you to do.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.900]   The App Store is clearly a poor fit for us
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:39.980]   with the removal of Fission.
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:43.900]   We no longer have any products in the Mac App Store.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:45.380]   They're a great example.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:48.020]   They make audio hijack, which I use every single day.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:51.300]   It's like a magical tool for recording stuff
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.100]   live from a microphone, recording stuff that's streaming in
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:56.220]   as a VCR for streaming audio.
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:58.980]   And no, they couldn't do it under App Store rules.
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:01.420]   And that's actually at Rogamiba is another good example.
[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.820]   They are a really good studio for apps.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.860]   And if they come up with something that's brand new,
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.900]   I want to hear about it.
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:13.780]   And I will also say that this blog post is not unique to Rogamiba.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:14.740]   It's a regular--
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:17.180]   is a story I keep hearing regularly from a lot of developers
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.580]   where they just have to keep asking themselves the question,
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:22.300]   does all of the hassle they have to go through
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:25.780]   to maintain a presence in the Mac App Store worth whatever
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:28.500]   attention that they get through being in the App Store?
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.060]   Because remember, it's not just about make sure that, OK, well,
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:34.580]   gee, so audio hijack can't have pornographic content.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.820]   We're OK with that.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.940]   And it's more like, well, if it's going to be the App Store,
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:41.660]   now I have to support certain APIs that really are not
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.420]   relevant for our app.
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:47.060]   We have to comply with certain amount of rules that, once again,
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:51.300]   we'd have to spend a whole bunch of months on stuff
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:56.940]   that are socially responsible for app store compliance
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.260]   when we would rather spend those three months adding features.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:01.980]   So yeah, this is why I'm glad that the Mac Store is open.
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:06.340]   Because I think that you can still
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:10.580]   have a vibrant app store environment on iOS, where it really
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:14.820]   is explicitly a consumer level experience, not a computer
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.820]   that's designed to do absolutely anything.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.900]   If those same restrictions were to land on the Mac Store,
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:24.020]   that would fundamentally change what the Mac is for everybody.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:26.780]   I think that would be a long way away if it happened.
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:30.180]   But I think that you have to be, as a small app developer,
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.580]   that's not making expensive apps and so on and so forth.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:35.460]   I think that you have to have a certain level of quality.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:37.980]   Because what you sit on when you use the Mac App Store
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:39.780]   is the fact that there's a certain level of trust
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:42.900]   in the Mac App Store as a small developer.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.380]   Rogue Amoeba is mature enough and they make products.
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:48.180]   I use loopback and audio hijack every day, just like Andy.
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:52.020]   So that, and by the way, just in case you're wondering,
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:53.220]   buy them as a bundle.
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.380]   Like, don't, don't write.
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:56.100]   Buy one, buy one's cry once.
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:57.980]   Because it just, it always hurts.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.780]   Because it, it always hurts.
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:01.220]   Or just put some money in a box and mail it to them.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.140]   Because at some point, you're going to be glad
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.060]   that they have to have a--
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:04.420]   You're going to pay more.
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:05.580]   You're going to pay more if you buy--
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:06.580]   Right, don't give that to them.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:08.020]   They do high-tech and audio hijack and audio hijack.
[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:09.260]   Then loopback, because you're going to buy both of them.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.580]   Because they work together anyway.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:13.220]   So anyway, so they can get away with this,
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.500]   because I'm willing to buy that app.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:17.340]   But like an unknown developer at this point,
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:20.060]   selling an app for less than $50, I don't give them the time
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:20.780]   of day.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:22.940]   Like, if they're not in the App Store,
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:24.820]   and it has less, it has something to do with security,
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:27.460]   has a lot to do with the fact that I got to install this.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:30.620]   Like when I get a new computer, the wonder of the App Store
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:33.300]   is like, as I turn it on and I go install,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:34.900]   I just go install everything.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.460]   And it just sets up my computer again
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:39.420]   with a nice fresh install of all the bits and pieces.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:44.180]   And so little apps, I'm not playing anymore.
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:46.180]   And so I think that's the challenge for-- and that's
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:48.460]   the advantage that small app developers get
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:51.780]   is a first level of trust and convenience for the user
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.340]   that makes it easier for them to sell into that market,
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.820]   because I'm willing to give them a chance.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:57.180]   I'm like, oh, well, they're here,
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.500]   and I'll buy a bunch of these.
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:01.580]   And they're less expensive now than they were before.
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:03.700]   But for small developers, I think the App Store
[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:05.140]   actually does a good job for it.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.100]   For companies like Mo Rogomeva and other ones
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.500]   that are more mature.
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.620]   But I think that if you venture out of the Mac store,
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:12.060]   you have to be really good at what you do,
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:14.100]   because there's a lot of people that I've talked to that
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:15.020]   are the same way.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:17.500]   They're like, I'm not going to bother.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:19.180]   And I don't disagree with you.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:21.300]   I think you've made excellent points there.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.940]   The thing that we're not talking about, though,
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:25.740]   are people who are not necessarily
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:29.100]   trying to make a fortune off of their menu bar utility.
[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:30.820]   But they think that, wow, I've made this thing,
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:32.780]   because I thought it really would be a great thing
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:34.420]   to exist for my desktop.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.660]   And now, with only two or three more months worth of work,
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.740]   I made it something that is muscular enough
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:39.860]   that anybody would want it.
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:42.260]   And I would love for people to give me $5 for it.
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:46.900]   And if they make-- just like my professional photography,
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.820]   I make less than $500 a year off of it.
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.700]   But whenever someone says, hey, if I gave you $100,
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:54.980]   can I use your roller derby pictures as part of our poster?
[02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.580]   Like, sure, I'd be very happy to do that.
[02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:01.260]   So I'm glad that Apple continues to have support
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:05.300]   for people who just want to be weird,
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.580]   be weird with as few rules as possible,
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.180]   and do it underneath their own terms.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.380]   So I think that we can both be right here.
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:13.740]   Yeah, no, I think that I'm glad-- because I still--
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.340]   a bunch of apps that I would not--
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:18.100]   there's a bunch of low-level apps that I use that would not
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:23.100]   work inside of the app store that I have that I need.
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:27.300]   And so I'm glad that we have both in that environment.
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:30.060]   I will welcome you to the wonderful world of Linux
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:30.900]   the minute it doesn't.
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:33.900]   Yes, I do.
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:38.260]   I love their times where sometimes you just
[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:41.900]   want to go to that beach that has cold water,
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:44.420]   because it's just such an invigorating environment
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:45.900]   as an alternative.
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:49.380]   And for me, that's what Linux is like when I can just say that,
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:52.700]   gee, I really-- just the idea that I don't like the way
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:53.940]   that my windows behave.
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:57.540]   I will spend the next two days looking at Windows managers
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.620]   and then another day figuring out how to configure them
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:02.420]   perfectly, and then I have exactly what I want.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.820]   I'm so happy that I have my Lenovo laptop that's just
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:09.900]   for Mint Linux.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:12.060]   It's just so hard for me to recommend it to people,
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.900]   like to regular civilians as people who just--
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:17.700]   I want to buy a Chromebook or I want
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:22.020]   to buy a mid-level Windows Notebook or an entry-level MacBook.
[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:25.020]   And I want to be just as happy with this Linux install
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:27.980]   as I will be with this Mac and with this Windows machine.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.980]   I'm not quite there yet to recommending it.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.300]   But yeah, I think everybody--
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:33.060]   everybody, once they have a machine that
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.220]   is no longer going to be running the latest and greatest
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:39.020]   Mac OS or Windows, they need to install Mint or Zoom
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:40.900]   or a very, very simple Linux distro,
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:44.100]   because if nothing else, it will show you exactly what you've
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:46.700]   been missing from these commercial operating systems.
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:52.020]   So breaking story just over the wire from CNBC,
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:54.940]   we talked a lot about Doug Field, who
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:59.180]   led the Tesla Model 3 project, leaving Tesla, going to Apple
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:03.460]   to serve as vice president of, quote, special projects.
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.300]   It's widely believed he was leading Apple's--
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:08.860]   or one of the leaders of Apple's car project,
[02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.620]   he has now left Apple and is going
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:17.900]   to Ford under the new Ford Plus turnaround plan.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:20.500]   Apple said in a statement, we're grateful for the contributions
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.460]   Doug has made to Apple.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:25.860]   We wish him all the best in his next chapter.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:29.820]   Yeah, that's-- obviously, we're all just reacting to this.
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.380]   This, to me, sounds like he wants
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:35.380]   to build something that will actually ship,
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:36.780]   and he has lost confidence.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:39.420]   Either he has lost confidence that Apple is on a path
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:42.060]   towards actually shipping something that amounts
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:45.540]   to a regular car, or that he is-- there's been a shuffle,
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:48.020]   and he can no longer have the amount of say in the project
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.460]   that he wants to.
[02:08:49.460 --> 02:08:51.620]   I think there was also-- I'm searching for it now,
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:54.060]   but I believe that Apple themselves
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:56.980]   made a very interesting hire where they hired
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:59.140]   some important people from.
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.340]   I want to say Mercedes-Benz, but I could be wrong, which made me--
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:06.140]   I do remember reading the story this morning or yesterday
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:08.460]   and thinking that, oh, so that is another data point
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.700]   towards they really want to make a real car, as opposed
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.500]   to they want to do a fleet vehicle,
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.820]   or they want to do an airport vehicle.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:14.660]   Yeah.
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:16.940]   If Apple hired a field, it was because they
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:19.340]   wanted to build a vehicle.
[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:21.740]   And I think you're right just on the face of it,
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:25.140]   if he's leaving so quickly, maybe he came to the conclusion
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:27.420]   that that wasn't in the near future.
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:30.460]   Could be-- could have to do with a lot of money.
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.380]   Could also be four--
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.060]   That too.
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:34.340]   --here's a billion dollars, yeah.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.860]   Like, here's the point, just thought,
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:37.740]   and here's a whole lot of money.
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:40.860]   The question is, is it-- Apple probably
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:43.700]   had the choice to try to outbid it.
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.660]   So it could be an enormous amount of money.
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.180]   He has so much information.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.380]   Like, starting at Apple, then going to Tesla, back to Apple,
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:50.420]   then going to--
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:52.180]   He is super valuable to--
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:55.540]   Like, I bet you, his numbers are really high.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.020]   But still--
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:57.220]   He also worked at Segway.
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:00.420]   So I'm hopeful that we're going to have a self-driving--
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:01.260]   Segway.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.260]   --two-wheeler.
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:06.060]   But still, if he was really the head of the Apple Car
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:08.460]   Project, he was making enough money
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:12.260]   to be one of those crazy, stupid tech people.
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:15.460]   It's hard to imagine how much more money you can pay a person
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:18.500]   that would say, wow, I'm really thrilled what's going on at Apple.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.060]   I really think I have a great future here at Apple.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:24.540]   But, yes, making 60 million instead of 40 million
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.540]   means that, yes, you got me forward, even though you've
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:29.300]   shown me nothing that I necessarily think
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:31.500]   is going to be a better direction for my career, for my talent.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:33.420]   But since he's created a new title for him,
[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:38.220]   "Chief Advanced Technology and Embedded Systems Officer."
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:39.740]   Yeah, and I think that the other thing is
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.820]   is that you get to a point where you
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:44.100]   want to get them maximized your return.
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:47.940]   He's probably one of 10 people that nobody knows in the world.
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:51.020]   And Ford gives him way of scalability
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:52.660]   because he now has an entire--
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:55.340]   Apple has possibly one car that it's
[02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.180]   going to put out at first, because that's what Apple does.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:59.780]   Ford has fleets.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:03.900]   So his ability to take what his ideas and project them
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.860]   across fleets over the next five to 10 years
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:08.060]   is much higher.
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.220]   He'll get to work with one car or two cars with Apple,
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:13.380]   and he'll get to work with the entire infrastructure of Ford.
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:14.940]   I think it's reinventing itself.
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:17.900]   This is a really exciting and interesting time to go to Ford,
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:18.940]   actually.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:21.820]   I think it's an interesting time to go to all the audio
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:24.180]   auto companies are--
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:25.380]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.220]   Electric.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.300]   Everyone is moving to self-driving.
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:29.500]   Everyone's moving to--
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:31.380]   so all of this stuff is all happening at one time.
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:34.660]   They're all in competition for the same very, very limited
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:37.260]   resource of experts that understand how to do this.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:38.620]   It's a really interesting thing.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:42.540]   Yeah, I'm more concluding than ever
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:46.740]   that he wants to build a car that will actually ship as a car.
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:50.380]   And what Apple is a maybe, Ford is a definite.
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:51.380]   You're right.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.940]   A car company that can add electronics
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:56.260]   is going to be more attractive than a technology company
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:00.020]   that might be building a car as a platform for testing out
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:02.300]   a technology that they are--
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:04.500]   I keep coming back to the analogy of--
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:08.260]   I keep thinking about those poor, poor Soviet cosmonauts
[02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:10.940]   who are training to land on the moon, who put all of their lives,
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:13.820]   put all their careers on hold, focusing all of their energy
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:14.740]   and their efforts.
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:16.620]   Only to be told that, yeah, we're not doing that anymore.
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:17.860]   Go home.
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:19.340]   And this project never happened.
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:21.740]   That's got to be demoralizing for someone--
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:23.500]   when he talked about executives who's
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:24.820]   been working in the car industry, he
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:27.340]   was like the head of the kettle cars for Tesla
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:28.620]   before coming to Apple.
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:32.060]   And if he gets a whiff that maybe they don't know what they're
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:34.820]   doing and they keep changing strategies every couple years,
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:37.620]   I would much rather go with a car company that will definitely
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:38.420]   make a car.
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:41.340]   If nothing else, the technology that he's developing
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:44.820]   can be implemented immediately in a level three
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:48.300]   assistive driving technology if it's not a completely self-driving
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:49.460]   technology.
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:52.820]   So yeah, there's a lot of interesting stuff here.
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:54.860]   I just think I very--
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:56.820]   I definitely expect to have Apple ship a car,
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.300]   but it's only going to be one.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:00.900]   It's not going to be like I can control all the lines of Ford.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:03.100]   I mean, now for a guy that's designed in car,
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.580]   the entire drivetrain or the entire process,
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:09.220]   for it's a much different thing and Apple will never get there.
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:10.020]   You never get to Apple.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:10.860]   It's got a really a plum job.
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:12.820]   And as you pointed out, Field had worked at Apple
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:15.180]   for five years prior to Tesla.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:18.460]   So he might have had a sentimental attachment to Apple,
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.700]   but you've got to think the Ford job's a plum.
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:25.140]   That's the job in that area.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:27.060]   Hey, I want to make a mention real quickly
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:29.620]   so that you can put it on your calendars.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:33.580]   I think you know we have a little thing called Club Twit,
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:34.820]   $7 a month.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:38.220]   It's a great way to support what we do,
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:41.620]   to encourage more of what we do.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.700]   We have the Discord server.
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:46.380]   We have ad-free versions of our shows for Club Twit members.
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:48.660]   And of course, the Twit Plus feed.
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:51.020]   Also, we've kind of promoted Ant Pruitt
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:52.340]   to be our community manager.
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:54.580]   We really needed somebody who would take Club Twit
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:56.980]   under his wing and massaged it.
[02:13:56.980 --> 02:14:00.620]   He's announced his first event coming up Friday,
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:05.300]   10 a.m. Pacific, Micah Sargent will do an AMA
[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:08.460]   on our Club Twit Discord.
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:10.540]   So make a little note of that.
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:11.540]   Save the date.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:13.580]   This Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:17.380]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:18.220]   Micah Sargent.
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.180]   And ask me anything in our Club Twit Discord.
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:21.860]   If you're not yet a Club Twit member,
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:23.660]   by the way, that will end up being on the Twit Plus feed
[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:26.020]   as well, but you need to be a Club Twit member to get that.
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:27.780]   If you're not a Club Twit member,
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:30.580]   please go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:35.060]   Help support our mission here at Saba to go Gigante.
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:36.460]   That's what I am.
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:37.740]   That's what I want to know.
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:39.140]   You want to do an AMA?
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:40.740]   And call an Ant Pruitt.
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:43.340]   I got another one for you, Ant.
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:44.180]   I loved it, boy.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:45.380]   I'd love to have you do an AMA.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.660]   That'd be awesome.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:47.420]   Yeah.
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:48.260]   And Andy, you too.
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.580]   And I'm sure that that's the plan,
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:50.980]   is to do one every week now.
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:51.500]   Absolutely.
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:52.940]   Yeah.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:54.420]   Let us take a break when we come back.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.540]   Your picks, boys and boys.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:58.900]   And a reminder, if you're just tuning in,
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:03.020]   the reason Renee's not here, he had a last minute emergency
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:05.740]   all as well, but he will be--
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:07.140]   I can't say he'll be back next week,
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:09.620]   because next week we'll be doing our Apple event.
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:12.820]   Renee often gets called away during those special, special
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.060]   days, but he'll be back soon, I'm sure.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:18.580]   I think the very thing about when Renee is away,
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:20.980]   he comes back with all kinds of really great information
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:21.900]   that we don't have.
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:22.380]   Exactly.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:23.860]   Exactly.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.540]   We'll pay for his parking at the airport.
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:29.020]   Well, let's do it that way.
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.460]   MacRae brought to you today by Udacity.
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:32.140]   You love tech.
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:32.820]   We know that.
[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:34.460]   Would you like to get a job in tech?
[02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:36.060]   Well, it's interesting.
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:39.780]   Udacity was founded by a former Googler, about 10 years ago,
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:41.780]   almost exactly, who was realizing
[02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:44.300]   that the skills people with computer science
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:48.580]   degrees brought to the job were maybe not quite sufficient
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:49.780]   for what Google needed.
[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:52.060]   He started Udacity, partnered with Google
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:54.260]   to create the nanodegree program.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:57.660]   Udacity is absolutely wonderful.
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.260]   I think the best in class part time online education
[02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:02.380]   program.
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:04.180]   Anybody who's looking to take their technology
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:07.060]   to the next level should check it out.
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:09.260]   But especially if you want to get a job in tech,
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:12.260]   these nanodegrees are designed in partnership
[02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:15.260]   with big companies, not just Google, Microsoft, IBM, AWS,
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:16.220]   and more.
[02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:20.460]   Your teachers are often team leads at these top companies.
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:23.540]   Teaching you-- in areas, there are nanodegrees in areas
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:26.740]   that you can't get anywhere else, like AI, deep learning,
[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:30.380]   flying car, an autonomous flight engineer, intro
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:31.300]   to self-driving cars.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:34.660]   You want us to be talking about you next year.
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:36.180]   Oh, you just took a job at Ford?
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:37.500]   That's where you start.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:41.820]   Machine learning engineer, robotics, software engineer.
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.580]   Now, one of the things I love about Udacity--
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:44.580]   I've taken courses there.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:47.900]   In fact, I joined almost as soon as they started.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:49.580]   One of the things I love about Udacity
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:50.940]   is it's very much hands-on.
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:53.020]   They understand you can watch the courses.
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:54.340]   You've got great teachers.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.500]   But until you've actually implemented what you've learned,
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:57.580]   you really haven't learned it.
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:02.260]   So all the courses are project-based, active learning.
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:03.780]   You'll test your knowledge.
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.660]   Your homework and projects will be reviewed
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:08.420]   by qualified professionals, just like code reviews
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:09.460]   at those big companies.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:12.660]   It's like you'll get when you get in the real job.
[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:14.340]   But you're not alone doing this.
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:17.020]   You're always going to have real human feedback and reviews.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:19.780]   There's a wonderful mentorship program
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:21.380]   which gives you access to mentors
[02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:23.780]   who can help you along 24/7.
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:29.860]   And I mean 24/7 because Udacity is often the first place people
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:31.140]   go who want to get a better job.
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:32.900]   So they still have the day job.
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:35.380]   But you can just put in five to 10 hours a week,
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.980]   maybe an hour a night, working at your own pace
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:39.340]   any time of the day or night.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.580]   It'll be in the morning too.
[02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:42.300]   Graduate as little as three months
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:44.460]   and get a great, great job.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:50.540]   Over 14 million people use Udacity in over 240 countries.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:52.460]   According to the World Economic Forum,
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:56.620]   75 million jobs will disappear replaced by automated processes
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:59.300]   in the next three years.
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.220]   Maybe it's time to start-- if that might be you,
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:03.860]   it might be time to start training for a job of the future.
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:07.100]   Check out the amazing courses at Udacity,
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:12.140]   udacity.com/twitflexiblepaymentoptions.

[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:15.220]   There are free courses.
[02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:18.420]   And if you're a business and you want
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:21.420]   to get your team to master cutting edge technologies

[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:30.140]   Udacity for Enterprise will help you upskill your entire workforce
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:33.900]   with those real world project-based learning classes
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:34.780]   they're so famous for.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:37.180]   Be sure to check out the Enterprise section of Udacity's

[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:05.820]   Twit75 is the offer code.
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:09.700]   Andy and I co, let's kick it off with your pick of the week.
[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:13.180]   My pick is the latest edition of the Google Nest Doorbell.
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:15.300]   They've just come up with a battery operated edition,
[02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:19.140]   which was a great solution for me because my building doesn't
[02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:20.780]   have wired doorbells.
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:23.380]   We get the power wires that go to the doorbell.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:29.140]   This operates for about two to three months on battery.
[02:19:29.140 --> 02:19:33.380]   When you need to recharge it, you use a special tool
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:35.260]   to pop it loose from its mounting brackets,
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:39.860]   so again, knuckleheads can't just simply pop it right off,
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:44.500]   plug it into a USB 3 charger and charge it back up
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:45.740]   for the two or three months.
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.380]   I like it a lot for--
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:51.740]   it took me a while to find a video doorbell that
[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:53.220]   does what I needed to do.
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:55.540]   I still think that you shouldn't have a video doorbell
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:58.420]   unless there is a problem that you need to solve with it.
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:00.140]   Otherwise, it's sort of a security
[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:02.900]   hole that you don't need to invite into your life.
[02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:05.380]   I have a problem that from time to time on this show,
[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:07.740]   you've seen where there's someone knocking at the door.
[02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:09.940]   I don't know if it's something that I need to get up
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:13.900]   from this desk while I'm broadcasting to go answer
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:16.220]   if I see that, OK, I know exactly what this is.
[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:18.460]   I'm just going to let them leave whatever it is at the door.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:20.700]   Or I'll send a text-- I know who this is.
[02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:22.940]   I'll send them a text message saying that, hey, come by.
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:24.740]   In about an hour, these are problems
[02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:26.260]   that I absolutely need to solve.
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:29.060]   So this is why I've sort of been looking for one of these things.
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:33.500]   I like the reasons why the Nest doorbell kind of did it for me
[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:36.460]   was largely because I do trust Google when it comes
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:40.060]   to privacy and security, again, within the limitations of Google.
[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:43.500]   But certainly, the other big player is Amazon.
[02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:45.540]   And I absolutely do not trust them.
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:50.700]   I also do not approve of how they're trying to sell Ring Doorbell
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:52.660]   through local law enforcement to turn it
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:57.820]   into sort of a private no warrant surveillance system.
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:20:59.860]   And as for third party options, I'm
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:02.420]   not sure that they've been really rigorously tested
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:06.380]   for security, for penetration from other people.
[02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:09.020]   They might try to access it from outside the network.
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.500]   So that solves that problem.
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.220]   I like the way that the software works.
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:15.580]   It's powered by Google artificial intelligence
[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:18.340]   so that we're asked the Ring Doorbell just like this one
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:23.020]   will let you, for instance, specify, oh, I only keep an eye on--
[02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:24.940]   here's the big wide angle view.
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:26.580]   Please only pay attention to what's
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:29.540]   happening in this driveway area that I've marked out for you.
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:34.100]   However, the Google Nest doorbell uses machine learning
[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:34.940]   image recognition.
[02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.660]   So you can say, please only give me
[02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:38.740]   alert when a car appears in the driveway,
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:42.020]   or please give me alert when a package appears on my doorstep,
[02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:45.060]   or if there is somebody-- when someone rings the doorbell,
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:48.740]   tell me exactly-- identify who it is and tell me exactly who it
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:51.700]   is because previously-- so you can basically say that, oh,
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:54.140]   well, this is that person who rang the doorbell.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:54.820]   That's my mom.
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:56.500]   So remember what my mom looks like.
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:58.180]   So as a result, you can basically
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.460]   get it to do the things that you want to do
[02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:01.820]   as a sophisticated door knob.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:04.820]   Besides, just simply be a dumb camera that switches on
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:08.380]   when there's motion detected and then switches off later on.
[02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:09.900]   Very, very easy to install.
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.300]   It comes with something that not a lot of video doorbells
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:14.900]   come with, which is the simplest damn thing,
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:19.260]   an actual angled bracket so that in my door
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:20.700]   is sort of in a corner.
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:23.620]   So if I have the camera mounting just flat
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:26.300]   against the door frame or the surround,
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:29.020]   all I will get is halfway just wall
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.980]   and the halfway will be what's actually forming to it.
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:34.420]   But given that it also comes with an angled bracket,
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:36.380]   I can simply put that bracket behind it.
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:39.540]   So now it's actually on an 80 degree angle
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:40.380]   so I can see other things.
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.980]   Installation was very, very easy.
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:43.580]   Setup was very, very easy.
[02:22:43.580 --> 02:22:47.500]   As it happens, I do have other Google Nest devices.
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:50.140]   I do have a smart display on my nightstand.
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:51.340]   I do have smart speakers.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:54.140]   So things get announced and the video gets fed very, very easily.
[02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:56.020]   So it's another advantage if you happen to be plugged
[02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:58.620]   into Google, but so far I'm very, very happy with it.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:22:59.900]   It hasn't been an annoyance.
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:02.340]   It has solved the problem that I wanted to solve.
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.940]   Wish I could solve it for less than $179,
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:08.860]   but I don't want to get a $50 video doorbell
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:11.060]   that I'll be three months later,
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:13.380]   I'll be just, I'll be on NPR here saying,
[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:17.140]   "Well, warning for everybody who has the Toowami video doorbell,
[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:19.780]   "it turns out that your feed is being put into
[02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:21.820]   "an actual streaming video service
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:24.260]   "and as Gavin does burn a stand."
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:27.060]   Okay, well I have to deactivate a whole bunch of things
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:29.620]   on my doorstep, but yeah, it works very well.
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:30.780]   I really, really like it.
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:31.940]   I also like that it's subtle.
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:35.380]   It doesn't stick out the way that a Nest doorbell does.
[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:36.660]   Very nice.
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:41.340]   I wonder if Apple would ever make something like that,
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.700]   they don't make any cameras.
[02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:44.140]   I wonder if they ever would do that.
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:44.980]   Probably not.
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:45.820]   I wish they would.
[02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:48.380]   That's an area that they could really move the needle
[02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:50.020]   because so much better I think.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:50.860]   Exactly.
[02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:54.340]   If Apple had a video doorbell,
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.460]   even though I don't have an iPhone,
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:59.900]   I would be thinking very, very seriously
[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:02.900]   about going with it instead of a Google doorbell
[02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:07.380]   because again, I trust Google within the lower case version
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:11.220]   of the word trust, but Apple, for all the jokes
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:13.180]   and for all the snarky comments I make
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:14.980]   and all the valid criticisms I make
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:18.420]   about how sometimes it's not so concerned about privacy
[02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:19.660]   as they want us to think.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:20.940]   I do think that they're the big,
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:22.740]   the trillion dollar tech companies,
[02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:24.700]   they're the most concerned with user privacy
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:25.900]   and protecting privacy.
[02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:27.540]   So that would be such a huge selling point
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.620]   for such a device.
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:29.460]   Yeah.
[02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.300]   It would look cool.
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:31.140]   Yeah.
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:33.740]   You could hear a 3D model of everybody who came to your house.
[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:35.020]   That's good.
[02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:36.820]   I think that person needs to lose a little weight.
[02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:38.180]   You could rotate them or not.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:41.060]   It says four pounds.
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:45.020]   Until some company makes a video doorbell
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:47.460]   that's a little panel slides open
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:50.060]   and one of those glass eyeball on an arm,
[02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:51.500]   like on job of the Hudson Palace.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:53.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:57.340]   Then that's gonna be, that's my pick so far.
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:59.140]   Oh my gosh, I need one of those.
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:01.220]   (laughing)
[02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.060]   How does that not exist?
[02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:02.900]   Not the no.
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:04.060]   Job of the Hudson Palace.
[02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:06.500]   And you can't come in unless you respond in hoodies.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:09.300]   Like, "Uta niktadu jaba du hut?"
[02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:10.860]   Like, "Pass friend."
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:13.340]   (laughing)
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:14.420]   Is that actual hut?
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:16.980]   That is mostly hut.
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:17.820]   (laughing)
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:21.380]   Our two-hutte-doa C3-pay-o-a.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:23.980]   Each day, "Niktadu jaba du hut."
[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.900]   Well, that ain't...
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:26.740]   Is that a nerve?
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:27.580]   Is that a nerve?
[02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:28.420]   I can...
[02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:30.380]   I can order in a hut restaurant
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:32.180]   without pointing at the menus.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:33.980]   So I'm not fluent, but...
[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:35.900]   Say, "Hello, goodbye, thank you."
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:36.740]   Yeah.
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:37.820]   Pizza, hey.
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:40.060]   Pizza the hut.
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:40.900]   I've been there.
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:41.740]   Sure.
[02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:42.580]   You know, there used to be a...
[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.420]   I'm holding out on the road.
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:44.740]   (laughing)
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:48.820]   And ILM, at ILM, between Cookie Bay and Sea Theatre,
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.100]   there used to be a thing called...
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:52.220]   It was Java, the hut, and it was the coffee place.
[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:53.300]   Java the hut.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:56.100]   I have my Java the hut mug
[02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:57.620]   that is not allowed to be used,
[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:00.180]   let alone washed, because if anything happened to that mug,
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:02.020]   I would be very, very upset with myself.
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:03.020]   And God, yes.
[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.700]   (laughing)
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:06.540]   Sorry.
[02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:09.220]   Alex, Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week.
[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:10.900]   So this one has bubbled up through this.
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:13.140]   I bring this next one through office hours
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:15.540]   that this becomes kind of the common knowledge
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.820]   of something starts with someone starting to experiment
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:18.780]   and then they start talking about it
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:20.140]   and they say, "You know, I'm buying it."
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:21.620]   And this is a company called Plugable.
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:23.740]   And one of the problems that we've had with the M1...
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:25.420]   Oh, love their stuff.
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:29.180]   Is that we haven't been able to get more than two monitors,
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.380]   you know, and this is not really built
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:31.580]   for more than two monitors.
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:33.460]   And so what Plugable does,
[02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:36.580]   it has this little box here, and this box is a USB-C,
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.980]   or you can do the USB-A with the converter or whatever.
[02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:44.220]   But USB-C, and it has either DisplayPort or two DisplayPort
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:47.700]   or two HDMI outs.
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:50.580]   If you take two of these and you plug them
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:54.660]   into your M1 Mac Mini,
[02:26:54.660 --> 02:26:59.620]   we have been able to get up to five displays out.
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:04.140]   So the reason we're doing it is because we're getting,
[02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:07.060]   we're pinning lots of people on Zoom
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.340]   so that we can get ISOs out of them, so that we can get all...
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:12.460]   So basically, you're still sharing audio for now,
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:16.500]   but if you wanted to get the video out of a Zoom room,
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:19.700]   we can get up to five per, and we're really doing four
[02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:23.180]   per room, but we can get a per computer.
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:26.660]   So it's a slick little box, and it's so far,
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:28.220]   it's worked really well.
[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:30.860]   I just started testing it, it's worked well for me,
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:32.340]   but we have other people within Office Hours
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:36.460]   that have been doing that Chris Fenwick,
[02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:38.820]   I'll call out the Chris Fenwick and Andrew Carlucha.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:40.620]   - Yeah, that's fine.
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:44.740]   - So that's really interesting.
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:46.740]   It sounds like the M1 has more capability
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:48.020]   than Apple's letting on.
[02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:53.060]   Well, I think that this is still like it's not as built in,
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:56.740]   it's built into support too, and it is...
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:59.420]   But yeah, it definitely seems that you can put,
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:02.860]   you can do more, I don't know if you can do as much,
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:05.620]   high performance output that you might want,
[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:08.460]   but definitely get more monitors out.
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:09.900]   - Very interesting.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.140]   Yeah, I've used a number of plug-able devices,
[02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:15.020]   I found them be very reliable, affordable, they're good.
[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:17.540]   - And the main thing is that we're trying to get
[02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:19.700]   some very simple things out of it, video,
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:21.140]   when you start adding all those monitors,
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:24.540]   and I think that what Apple's doing is it's keeping it
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:27.220]   limited to what it can do well.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:29.860]   We're asking to do more than what it can do well,
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:31.060]   but so far it's worked seamlessly.
[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:33.820]   So it hasn't been a problem, but we know that we're,
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:36.340]   asking the computer now to support more monitors
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:37.740]   than it was designed for.
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:40.060]   And for our purposes, it's working fine,
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:43.020]   but it may not work, use at your own risk,
[02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:44.820]   but it's working pretty well for those of us
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.380]   who need more monitors.
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:48.460]   - And also very handily has an ethernet port.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:49.860]   Just throw that in.
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:52.060]   - Just you may need that, you might want that.
[02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:53.220]   - Yeah.
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:58.220]   - Good pick, plug-able p-l-u-g-a-b-l-e.com, only 1g.
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:03.140]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay, officehours.global,
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:05.060]   that's the place to find out more about office hours.
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:07.500]   If you wanna hire Alex and his crew
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:12.140]   for your next stream, 090.media.
[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:14.580]   - And I'm actually getting interviewed
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:17.140]   by one of our members, Tony Mobley,
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:21.940]   is a teacher from Atlanta, or outside of Atlanta.
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.380]   And if you search for conversations with Tony Mobley,
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:27.500]   I'm on tomorrow, I think at five o'clock Pacific,
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.100]   or five o'clock Pacific Standard, eight o'clock Eastern Standard.
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:31.940]   If you do a search for that, I'll be on,
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:33.980]   he's gonna be grilling me.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.820]   - Fun.
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:35.660]   - I don't know what he's gonna ask,
[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:37.700]   but he's gonna ask what. - Oh, that sounds like fun.
[02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:40.180]   - The member that really started with,
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:42.780]   member of office hours that started with a laptop
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:44.980]   and trying to figure out how to get everything working.
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:46.420]   And now he's running his own show,
[02:29:46.420 --> 02:29:49.220]   and we've got members that are running.
[02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:51.300]   So basically, when you watch the show,
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:54.500]   you can watch me get interviewed,
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:57.020]   but the cool thing is, is then on the back end,
[02:29:57.020 --> 02:29:59.620]   they're doing Zoom rooms in AWS,
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:01.740]   and then they're tying them all into vMix,
[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:02.740]   and then they're pushing them all out.
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.580]   So all the graphics that you see in that stream
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:07.940]   are all done in the cloud, like really in the cloud.
[02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:11.140]   So it's kind of an amazing production process as well.
[02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:14.420]   So it's kind of the, we think it might be the future.
[02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:16.740]   So we call it the Mobley Process.
[02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:18.540]   - Nice.
[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:19.380]   - There's the Bellback Method,
[02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:20.300]   and it is the Mobley Process,
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:21.180]   and this show,
[02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:23.420]   "The Conversation with Tony Mobley" is the Mobley Process.
[02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:25.860]   (laughing)
[02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:28.060]   - Andy and Ico, WGBH,
[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:30.900]   we already talked about your appearance this Thursday again,
[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:31.740]   yes?
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:32.580]   - Yep.
[02:30:32.580 --> 02:30:35.940]   - Just go to wgphnews.org live or later to stream it.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:37.220]   Friday at 1230, I think.
[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:38.460]   - Perfect.
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:39.300]   - Perfect.
[02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:42.100]   We also do this show,
[02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:44.220]   and it'll be a special one next week,
[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:46.420]   because we'll be covering the iPhone 13,
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:49.380]   if that's what Apple chooses to call it.
[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:51.940]   We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday,
[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:55.420]   11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.980]   So if you wanna watch live next week,
[02:30:57.980 --> 02:30:58.820]   we'll be starting early.
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:02.220]   You know what, start with the iOS today at 830 Pacific,
[02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:04.020]   and just watch all day.
[02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:05.780]   It'll be a great Apple day.
[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:11.140]   The live streams are at twit.tv/live, audio or video.
[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:13.580]   If you're watching live chat live in our IRC,
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:16.140]   irc.twit.tv, of course, club twit.
[02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:19.500]   Members also can chat live in the discord,
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:21.820]   always a fun place to be.
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:25.060]   'Cause it has animated GIFs,
[02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:27.100]   which makes it even more exciting.
[02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:32.340]   Club twit, I always wait for the club twit folks
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.900]   to post appropriate animated GIFs.
[02:31:34.900 --> 02:31:37.020]   (laughing)
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:41.580]   At the end of every show, club twit is at twit.tv/clubtwit
[02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:43.420]   if you wanna know more.
[02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:46.140]   On demand versions of this show are available, of course,
[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:49.820]   at the website twit.tv/mbw.
[02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:51.460]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated.
[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:54.380]   If you watch, you know, at your leisure on demand,
[02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:57.220]   you could still kinda converse asynchronously with us.
[02:31:57.220 --> 02:31:59.460]   We've got a Twit forums, they're free to all,
[02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:02.420]   a twit.community, also our Mastodon instance
[02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:04.140]   at twit.social.
[02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:06.340]   We take questions and talk about stuff there,
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:09.140]   some good conversations going on there.
[02:32:09.140 --> 02:32:10.180]   Of course, the best way to get the show
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:12.580]   would be to get a podcast client,
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:15.740]   a podcatcher, if you will, and subscribe.
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:19.220]   If your podcatcher allows for reviews,
[02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:21.220]   please give us a five-star review, help.
[02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:26.420]   Share the good news that is back at break weekly.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.580]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:29.780]   See you next week, thank you, Alex.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:33.060]   See you all next week with a big Apple announcement.
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:34.580]   Now, it's time to get back to work
[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:36.380]   'cause break time is over.
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:37.820]   Have you ever read a tech news story
[02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:39.460]   and thought to yourself, man, I would love
[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:40.900]   to talk to the person who wrote this
[02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:42.220]   to find out more information?
[02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:45.460]   Well, that's exactly what Mike Asargent and I, Jason Howell,
[02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:48.700]   do each and every week on Tech News Weekly.
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:50.620]   We read the stories that matter to us,
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:53.060]   we reach out to the people making a break in the tech news
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.180]   and we invite them on to tell their story.
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:57.380]   And you can find it at twit.tv.
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:32:59.980]   Look for Tech News Weekly every Thursday.
[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:05.140]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:07.720]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:10.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:12.880]   (upbeat music)
