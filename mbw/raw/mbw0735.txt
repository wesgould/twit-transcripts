[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   It's time for Mac Break weekly. Lori and Renee are busy doing other things. I wonder what,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.560]   but we've got a great panel for you. Rosemary Orchard is here, Doc Rock, Andy Inako. The new
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   iPhones are here also. Four of them will talk about all the ins and outs, the cameras. And Rosemary
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.400]   says she can't wait to get that little home pod mini for her bathroom. All that and more. We're
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.560]   going to take a look at all of Apple's big announcements today next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the post-Apple event show. Andy Inako is fainted, but as soon as
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   maybe he saw the price of the new iPhone, I don't know. As soon as he comes back, we will get him
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.480]   on. But fortunately, and of course Renee Ritchie and Laurie Gilbother in Briefings,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   I believe right now. But fortunately, we have a great panel to help us dissect the 5G event
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.760]   that Apple just did about 5G from Verizon with us. 5G, Rosemary 5G Orchard from Rosemary5G Orchard.5G
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.280]   COM. Hello Rosemary Orchard. Hello Leo 5G LePort. It's great to see you. Rosemary is the queen
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.680]   of actions and shortcuts. And I bet you just die in and get some new iPhone shortcuts started here.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.080]   Yeah, definitely. Also with us from Honolulu, it's Doc Rock.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.280]   Hello everyone. Aloha, youtube.com/docrock. You both watched the 5G announcement.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.760]   I shouldn't do this. I'm going to stop saying it. But I just, it feels, I hope Verizon gave them
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.320]   a billion dollars. And that they then gave it all to charity. Yeah, they don't need a billion dollars.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.560]   What the hell? Every feature mentioned and with 5G, it's going to be fantabulous.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.000]   Was it just me or was it going through my mind? You know, when they're doing like they showed
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.120]   how they made cardboard models, but they didn't have to make cardboard models anymore,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   did it just strike you that, you know, they're probably not using 5G. They're probably using
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.760]   Wi-Fi because they're in a building. Why would they even care about 5G? Yeah, it's like airports
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.440]   seem to specifically build their buildings to block phone signals so that you have to pay for
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.680]   the Wi-Fi. Right. They're not suddenly going to put 5G in there so that everybody can use their
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.960]   5G for free instead of paying $20 an hour for the slowest Wi-Fi known to human existence.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.200]   And you would know this Rosemary over here in the United States. We call football soccer football,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.560]   we it's a different game. But in the football, you can, I'm sure, in the NFL stadiums, you know,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.800]   Verizon making a big deal how they've got milli, this is the Verizon flavor is millimeter wave.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.040]   Although they don't own it. Anybody could do it. But Verizon is really pushing it and they're
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.880]   saying, it's in all the NFL stadiums. Yeah, in a corner of the NFL stadiums, if you're in the right
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   position, you can use it. The rest of the stadiums using perfectly fine Wi-Fi, which they've had for
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.720]   years for Verizon's. So for anybody who doesn't know, there are there are different kinds of 5G.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.400]   The most commonly seen 5G, particularly because of T-Mobile, is this low band 600 megahertz 5G.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680]   That works just like your cell phone goes through walls. It's Verizon has it everywhere. It's not
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.200]   faster, but it's out there. There's also a flavor of 4G that AT&T calls 5G, but it's not 5G. It's
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   4G, but it's your phone says 5GE. Then there's this ultra wide band or millimeter wave 5G. The
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.720]   problem with it is it's a very high frequency. It does not travel well through walls, doesn't
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   travel through raindrops. So it only works if you're close to the cell tower with a direct line
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.240]   of sight to the cell tower. It is a very limited thing that we're seeing Verizon implemented as
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.360]   business internet in buildings. They put a millimeter wave transmitter. But right now,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.440]   millimeter wave is available to a very small subset of Americans. And frankly,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.760]   it's at 30 to 300 gigahertz. It's such a high frequency that I'd seen estimates you'd have to
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   quadruple the number of cell sites to support it. And I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.800]   There's another issue which nobody's addressed, but I gathered because, by the way,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.760]   Pixel phone, the new Google Pixel 5 also has millimeter wave 5G radios. And it's estimated it's
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.960]   about $100 additional cost because of the additional radio you have to put in. So in effect, we're
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.600]   all paying 100 bucks more for a phone that for a service we can't, most of us ever use.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   Especially outside of the US, there are so many areas here in the UK, I am sitting here and I
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.680]   believe I have one bar of signal. That's it. And my provider does not offer Wi-Fi calling,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.840]   so I'm limited to one bar of signal. So I have to go and stand outside if I take a phone call.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   And there are so many places around the world where there's no decent signal at all. Right.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   That making a song and dance out of 5G, especially for a specific provider,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.400]   which isn't in a lot of the countries of the people who are watching it stay kind of else.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.040]   That's a good point.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.160]   Like it was a bad idea.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.760]   For Isons US only, isn't it?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   The other issue, if Ison has said, we're going to do a middle band and a low band maybe,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.880]   but so it's not just millimeter wave. But all of the benefits they touted
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   were millimeter wave, you know, things like 10 gigahertz, what do they say? 30, 24 gigahertz,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.040]   some huge number of data transfer. But that's only millimeter wave and it's not going to be
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.680]   widely available. Somebody did point out though that China 5G is more widespread. And so it may
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.800]   well be the China market that they're carrying about at this point than the UK or the US market.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.960]   Yeah. And then I guess another thing to kind of point out, of course, you know,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.840]   that eliminates everybody that's on big blue. We don't currently have it as Leo mentioned.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.000]   And like Rosemary said, for myself, like in my studio, I have to use a microcell
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.760]   just to even get anything. And that thing was so buggy that I eventually turned it off.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.280]   And so, you know, thanks to Wi-Fi calling, that's literally how it works.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.840]   But, you know, I think it has to start somewhere. So as much as it seems kind of weird,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.520]   it has to start somewhere. And from there, the ramp up shell begin.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.320]   And I think the key element for people to take away from the day's event is remember that
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   there is no quote unquote 5G. There's a lot of things that are 5G. It's a myriad of about a
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.320]   It's a marketing term. Yeah. Right. It's 11 disparate technologies. And every company steals
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   about five to seven of those into their package to call it what it is. But like for the the people
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.960]   that are going on here crashing quote unquote 5G towers, I'm like, there is no quote unquote 5G.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.680]   It's a series of things that fits, you know, like lettuce. You'll probably see in conjunction
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.320]   with this. Is it just a coincidence, a big announcement from Verizon today about how it's rolling out
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.000]   5G. I think they even mentioned this, the Hans mentioned it on stage at the Apple event.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.160]   They're rolling it out to 200 million Americans, but that's not millimeter wave. That's low band.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.800]   That's the sub six hundred megahertz 5G that T-Mobile's already offering. And, you know,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.280]   PC magazine has tested this and it's not much faster if at all faster than your existing LTE. So
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:57.360]   Apple somehow, maybe this was a deal they made with rising. It's kind of ironic because Verizon
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   was the first company Steve Jobs went to when he was trying to pitch the iPhone. And they said,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.440]   no, we don't want an iPhone. That's, no, we're not interested. They turned him down. That's why I
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:16.160]   went with AT&T. And now we've come full circle 13 years later and Apple is all in on Verizon for
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   I don't even I don't even understand it. I don't even understand it. Oh, hey,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   Enne and I go welcome. Yay. Sorry about the sorry about that. After the as soon as the event ended,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   I had to address something that was imminent. And then and then I had to go I had to visit the
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.320]   necessary. But I'm all I'm all about. You heard us talk about the 5G announcement from Apple.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.640]   Yeah. It's the thing that's going to be constant is that like you guys are saying near the end
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.000]   there that 5G isn't really isn't really a thing. And usually we use that term to mean that, oh,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.520]   well, gosh, this is ridiculous. This is never going to happen. Start pretending that it's going
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.480]   to be one. In this case, I think when I say that 5G isn't really isn't a thing, is that we don't know
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.520]   we the users, the people making phones, people making carriers, the people who making services,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.720]   they don't know exactly what role 5G is going to serve. They know that it's a good solution for a
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:21.040]   lot of specific things. But it's not like the transition to LTE where they could manifestly say
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   that everything that your phone does right now, it will do the same things only faster. And it will
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.520]   also enable the following technologies like video streaming services and conferencing services
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.680]   and more practical desktop hotspot and laptop hotspot services that aren't practical with 3G
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.800]   right now. And everyone could say, oh, wow, okay, that's great. I love all those things. Great
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.440]   same up for 4G with 5G. A, they haven't really defined yet what services are we going to get
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.040]   that we can't already do that can't really be can already do it a practical manner with LTE
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   and 4G technology. You'll notice that in terms of an actual practical example, they gave one
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.960]   really specific example. And they were kind of melodramatic about it. Like imagine that imagine
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.640]   like someone, a first responder who needs to have like a full MRI scan data set and getting that
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.120]   data set in seconds a set of minutes, that could save the life of a stroke victim like,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.840]   oh, okay, I suppose it could. Yes, you have a point there. But and also making the point that
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:30.400]   the other point, the other thing about Apple is about health. It's also about security and saying
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.280]   that 5G will mean that now someone will not who's working on their laptop won't have to use or rely
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.000]   on Wi-Fi hotspots and open hotspots, which will make your system more secure. But all of these
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   features are also going to be conditional upon what hardware do you have, what coverage is available
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.880]   in that area? Like you guys were saying, are we talking about millimeter wave or are we talking
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.840]   about something that's the less ambitious technology that's being packaged and sold underneath this
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.360]   5G sticker? So when I say that it's not a thing yet, I don't think that this is a thing where if
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.600]   someone decides that the finds the phone that they consider to be the love of their life and it
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.880]   doesn't have millimeter wave or it's even an LTE phone, this is probably the last year in which
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.480]   you could say, you know what, it's going to be okay because it's going to take you probably a year or
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.880]   two before 5G really explains itself. And here's what here's a problem or it can solve for you or
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.040]   an opportunity it can create for you. And it's going to take a while for all this stuff to shake
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.360]   up and for all the coverage maps to sort of fill out in the area. So I'm not surprised at all that
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.080]   Verizon did whatever they had to do get on that stage. I'm sure that there was a trade-off of
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.520]   some kind. I don't believe I don't believe they bought a marketing opportunity here. I don't think
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.080]   they would there was a this is like when the when two YouTubers decide to do a collab or something
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   like that. But I believe that this is part of a relationship that Verizon deeply, deeply sought
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.120]   to have a very, very close connection to Apple's 5G phones. But because I think where I was talking
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.160]   about this last week, the week before that Verizon is unusual amongst all these carriers, all the
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.280]   character carriers worldwide are moving are making sure they're they're ready for 5G and they have
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   plans for 5G. I think Verizon is the only company that has staked the identity and the reputation of
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   the entire company on it. They really they've decided to roll the dice and say that we are going
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.960]   to get so many subscribers new subscribers to Verizon because we above everybody else is going to be
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.080]   so, so supportive of 5G technology when people decide we want the next thing that the Verizon
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.680]   network is going to be the best network in which to get all these services that are going to work
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   for 5G. So it's not just hey, this here's this feature it's our branding. So this really is
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.200]   is more important to Verizon to any other company that all these bets that they made on 5G
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.280]   absolutely pay off. So yes, absolutely. They I'm sure that the Verizon phone they want
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.240]   for us want to make sure that the most popular phone single phone in the world, one of those
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.000]   most popular phones in all of America works best on Verizon networks because no one has I don't
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.160]   have allegiance to AT&T. I use them because it's good service where I live. I can get a good rate
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:16.560]   and it works fine. But if I had a really good reason to switch to Verizon, for instance, I could
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.240]   get like home broadband speed hotspots on my device without paying more than I'm paying for AT&T.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.520]   Oh boy, what I switched to Verizon in a heartbeat. So what we're seeing is again PR, we're talking
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.680]   about marketing, we're talking about banging the wardrobe and making sure that the name of Verizon
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.920]   is always an ever more associated with the best and latest and greatest in 5G.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   Rosemary, do they mention 5G a big marketing thing in the UK? I mean, is that
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.280]   do you see billboards in the subway? I think there's one provider that can do some of that,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.760]   but it's pretty much only in some areas of London and that's it. And so we don't see that media
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.280]   blitz that we see here in the US. No, no. And the other thing is, is there so much of this
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.760]   country that doesn't even have broadband or 3G. So they're still living on edge or whatever they
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   can get Skype, not Skype, like satellite or something like that to try and get internet. So
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.840]   yeah, that would be pretty portaister if they were doing that. I know that there has been a
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.560]   lot more about 5G in the news recently because some people have some very strange thoughts as to
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.280]   what 5G can be to you. That's why they're burning those towers, aren't they?
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:36.640]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And it's no, it doesn't cause, you know, any kind of million to a mute.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.320]   Rosemary, well, you're looking very good for a new day. And it's forgive me. We're going to get
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.600]   into the iPhone. Forgive me if I'm being sexist. Thank you. Forgive me if I'm being sexist here,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Rosemary, but I, my immediate thought when I saw the iPhone mini is that's a phone for women.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.640]   Except for the fact that we don't have pockets. So we can get the biggest phone.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.880]   Oh, we have to carry a purse around any way. So why not just get the biggest phone and jam it in there?
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.720]   So you're not looking at a little teeny, when you're phone going, oh, that's for me.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:16.160]   No, no, I'm there going 12 pro Mac. You want the biggest phone possible. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.080]   Doc Rock, are you a mini phone lover? Are you are you? See these eyes right here, dude?
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:30.240]   Like you want the biggest? Yes, the magic of high index plastic means I don't have to wear
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.480]   Coke bottles, but 20 years ago, these bad boys would have required to put a tether on the back
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.000]   of my head to keep my head straight. So yeah, I've been so far away from that since we got the
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.640]   larger screen. I do love the size of the eight, but it's more or less, you know,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   yeah, I got fat fingers and half blind. So I'm going all in. However, I did mention
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.240]   to the small lady over there that hey, they're going back to the iPhone four size and iPhone
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.440]   four shape. And she's like, that's the one I want. Oh, interesting. I didn't finish my sentence and
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:14.000]   it came out like so I know what my Christmas shopping looks like. I'm done. Absolutely done.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.800]   Before we go too much farther, I should warn everybody you won't be able to get the mini or
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:27.920]   Rosemary's iPhone 12 pro max until next month, ordering for the both the biggest and the smallest
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:34.240]   iPhone doesn't start until November 6th with a ship date a week later November 13th. However,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:42.880]   you can order on Friday, you can order an iPhone 12 or an iPhone 12 pro, the middle two sizes.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.240]   I'm not sure why that is. I guess it's COVID. We kind of knew that this is in fact, there was nothing
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.040]   in this announcement that was surprising. I don't think there was anything we didn't know about,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.120]   including the magsafe adapter. But we did hear that this would be the case. The prices, I have to
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.040]   say Apple now and they showed a slide at the very end of the event. They have a phone for every
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.920]   price point almost it seems like the iPhone SE starting at $3.99 and then in a hundred dollar
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:17.280]   increments all the way up to the iPhone 12 pro max at $10.99. It seems like there's a Apple is
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:23.760]   now in that position that they got into with the iPod where they have a phone for every price point.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.040]   Rosemary, would you consider ordering a medium sized phone until?
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.240]   I mean, I have the medium sized phone right now. I've got the 11 pro and if it's in my hand quite
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.560]   nicely with the help of a pop socket on the back. But it doesn't have the same great battery life
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.520]   that I have with the 10s max and that's what I'm looking forward to. I want the battery life.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.200]   I don't want to be living in a battery case all day. I'll grant you I'm a developer. I run
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   developer betas. That's my fault for worse battery life there, but still even if I wasn't running
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.400]   it, I don't think it would be as good as I was used to on the app.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.600]   I do have to worry with the mini, which is roughly the size of a 4.7 inch iPhone. It's got a bigger
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.680]   screen because there's no bezels. But how good could the battery life be on that?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.080]   Yeah. That was an interesting observation. They did point out that this is the
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.560]   definitely the smallest 5G phone ever. You can definitely believe it because one of the reasons
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:23.440]   why they are one of the reasons why these makers are touting, "Oh, look how big and lush and wonderful
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.520]   the screen on our new 5G model phone is, is because you need to have a bad big case to
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.800]   stuff those big batteries in it." They did mention in this, I believe, I caught a glimpse of the
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.800]   the tic-tac-toe slide that accompanies all product rollouts where you quickly screenshot it
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.640]   because that's where they put a summary of everything they put in here. I believe there was a tile
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   there for a new improved battery management system. One of the advantages of using their own
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.120]   silicon and designing their own chips is that they can absolutely hotwire and tailor the
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.200]   circus to the best battery performance whatsoever. I would be shocked if the battery life were...
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.840]   I would be surprised if they didn't do something like saying that the... And yet the iPhone 12
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.720]   Mini has the same battery life as the iPhone 11 and then they'll say something about improved
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.920]   battery life on the iPhone 12 Pro. The spec pages up for the Mini and they're claiming...
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:24.320]   Apple never says, "How many milliamp hours or anything?" These two phones are the iPhone 12 Mini
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.920]   and the iPhone 12 on the left, the iPhone 12 Mini. 15 hours video playback, 10 hours
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:38.240]   streamed video playback, 50 hours of audio playback for the iPhone 12, 17, 11, 65.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:45.760]   I remember when I looked at the specs for the 12 Pro Max, it was some outlandish number.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.520]   It was definitely... I think something like 20 hours of video playback. But even 15, I can't
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.360]   remember what they claim. This is the problem is I can't compare Apple to anything else.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:05.520]   My sense is that's roughly the same as the iPhone 11 playback time. That's pretty good. It
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.400]   seems like all day battery life. Can I ask a question? Doc Rock. It's like we still slightly...
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.520]   Maybe I could be off base. So everyone in the chat, you can yell at me if I'm wrong.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.240]   We still naturally need jerk to battery life, battery life, battery life, but I haven't had
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.440]   a battery life issue since iPhone 10. I mean... No, you're right. Maybe I use cases different.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:36.400]   But everyone would talk about this. It's automatic. We're just afraid, right? Because if it had
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   crappy battery life, that would be a problem. I personally, genuinely have an issue where I'm
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:47.120]   there mid-afternoon and my iPhone is running out of battery. And so that is genuinely an issue for
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.520]   me. But I will also grant you that I'm a power user. I'm not a normal person. My parents certainly
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:00.560]   don't have this issue. They're running 10 and a 10s. My dad goes two days without charging his phone.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:07.760]   So maybe they're abnormal users as well. To compare, the iPhone 12 mini, as I said,
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.560]   15 hours of battery playback, 17 on the iPhone 11, 13 on the iPhone SE.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.040]   So you're getting a tiny screen, tiny form factor, all the latest processor technology,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.440]   all the latest camera technology, minus the third lens, and better battery life than the SE. So
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   that sounds pretty good. That sounds pretty good. Yeah. I think also one thing that's key to
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.160]   mention about battery, and I think a lot of people forget this, depending on your location,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.480]   your phone, the number one thing that eats your battery is the one thing that you kind of sort
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.840]   of straight up can't control. If your location requires your phone to constantly be reaching for
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.520]   towers because it can't find towers, or you're stuck in a triangulation spot where you're between
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.400]   the Venn diagram, you're like in between two towers, and it's vacillating between towers left
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.840]   and right or four and aft, you will eat more battery. And that's sort of out of control. Yeah.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.920]   I don't think a lot of people realize that and they go to, well, this app did this,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.000]   or the new OS is jacking me. And it's like, no, bro, just pure science, you just happen to be
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.720]   in a wicked bad spot. If you're going from the 11 Pro Max to the 12, Apple's claiming exactly the
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:27.200]   same battery. I'm seeing 20 hours, 12 hours, 80 hours, exactly the same battery. So you'll get
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.840]   roughly what you're getting. These are meaningless numbers, because as you point out, Doc Rocket
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.040]   depends on your signal, but you'll get roughly the same battery life on a Pro Max 12 than you would
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.960]   on 11. Yeah, I do think that Apple tends to tend to pursue the exact same strategy with iPhone
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.320]   batteries as they do with Apple Watch batteries, where I think they believe that above a certain
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:56.480]   level of endurance, people aren't willing to trade off features or power that if you could give them
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   an Apple watch that lasted for five days, a screen always on, they would love that they would jump
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   all over it. But if they said, Oh, but to get that five day performance, we can't do always on EKG,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.760]   we can't do always on heart rate monitoring. We have to give you a dimmer screen. I don't think
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.520]   that most people, but I think that the majority of people are in the habit of just plugging in their
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.720]   phone at night or plugging it in when they wake up and they're doing their morning shower and
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.600]   seeing that an hour later, it's fully topped off. So for most people having to top it off overnight
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   is not a big deal. Rosemary was absolutely said something I absolutely agreed with that there's so
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:40.960]   many times in the before times, almost every major phone that I have owned has been able to get me
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.720]   through a full day's of work. However, there's also that one or two days a week when I'm spending
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:53.840]   the entire day in Boston, because going from like a meeting to a radio booth to now I'm going to be
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.480]   doing some work on the train, I'm going to be doing some work someplace else. And I will always have
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.040]   to top off my battery sometime around two or three in the afternoon. And I don't know that that's a
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.640]   solvable problem for Apple or anybody else. So at some point they're going to have to say,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.760]   let's hold the line of expectations, which is definitely a full day, two days, if you're not using
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.400]   it that often. And beyond that, I don't think it's going to be worth whatever sacrifices we have to
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.480]   make either by making it huge and heavy or by removing features. We're going to charge it every
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.800]   night anyway. And by the way, let's talk about charging, because I think this mag safe charger is very
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:34.000]   intriguing. Yeah, super. I was excited by that. It's not it's not anything new, though, right? I mean,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.040]   so part of the issue, when we were talking before the show, Rosemary and Doc Rock and I were talking
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   about how if you have a flat Qi charger, it's always challenging to find the right spot on it
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.720]   to charge, you can easily put it somewhere where it's not charging and wake up the next day and
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:55.680]   it's not charged. The three of us have easel chargers, right? Because yeah, that way you can
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:01.280]   I always get in this right spot if it's on the easel is charging. But I but we've all been used
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.240]   to the idea that the the little puck that charges your Apple watch goes, it's got a magnet in it.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.720]   It's not like Apple and created this from whole cloth. This is something they've done and other
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.920]   companies have done for a while in their phone. But and I and I didn't get a sense of the size,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.600]   but it looks like the puck, the makes a fuck for the phone is just like the Apple watch puck only,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.800]   you know, twice as big. And I think it's a 10 or as well to compensate for that.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.320]   It's the same size as your iPhone with. So I'm laughing at the comment.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:44.640]   Rever Mike said, first you must send in your Qi iron fist. Sorry. I'm a Marvel nerd. I apologize.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:52.880]   So there are not, by the way, the rumors were correct. No charger in the box. No air pods in the
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.760]   box or iPhones and headphones in the box. You're going to get merely no there is an iPhone. I hope
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.440]   you don't get an iPhone. No, no, we're just buying boxes now. Just a box. Yeah, beautiful box.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:11.840]   The you'll get the iPhone and you'll get a cable lightning to type C cable. And that's it.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.720]   They do support. This was going to cause. This is going to cause the clickbait press
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.560]   in the muggles to lose their muggles are going to lose their mug. They're going to
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.920]   lose your mind play. Almost nobody uses that charger and almost nobody uses those headphones
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.440]   anymore. Right. And well, if they took it out, then why couldn't it be cheaper? And it's like,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.320]   you know what, they gave you better stuff. You know, 1.6 f stop on the camera. That's amazing.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.920]   I know those suckers in the river, right? But people, especially and the reason why the
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.600]   muggles are going to lose it. All of us tech press people go, you know what, this is beautiful.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.120]   Everybody will shut up. But if the clickbait tech press goes, oh, Apple is good. And the muggles
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:04.640]   are going to go Apple is good. $39. I've had experience with people responding to things I
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.480]   say that they don't they don't take my word for anything or believe that my authority. So I've had
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.280]   problems with that. I don't think that I don't think that I don't think most people lose
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.480]   their mind, at least no one worth worrying about. I do think that it is reasonable to say, okay,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.600]   well, you used to give us stuff in the form of, yes, I already have a charger, but I don't have
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   one that I can leave inside the inside the kitchen, kitchen plug or the bathroom plug. Yes, I do
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.120]   have Bluetooth headphones, but I don't have a spare pair that I can leave in my laptop bag
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.600]   for when my Bluetooth headphones stop working because of battery life or anything like that.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.280]   So it's not as though it's a zero result sort of thing. Also, I thought that Apple, to be fair,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.720]   decided to be a little bit cute about that. They tucked that inside. It's environmental
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.200]   hunk during the show and saying, and here's how we're going to be saving the environment
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.680]   by not only not only reducing the amount of e-waste for these chargers and headphones that are
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.600]   unnecessary, but also making the boxes themselves smaller, thus reducing paper waste said, yeah,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.840]   and it also means you can pack more of these devices into the same shipping container
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.080]   and save shipping costs, but I'm sure that that was not in your mind whatsoever, was it?
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.120]   I don't think it's a deal breaker by any means. I think that if they decided to move on some of
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:24.800]   these rumors that Apple wants to have an iPhone with absolutely no mechanical wire plugs anywhere,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.760]   then I would be saying, oh, it's too early for that, and I don't let's see what kind of problems
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.840]   result from this. But the fact that, thank God, the best news of the entire thing was to make sure
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.120]   that, okay, they weren't, they were indicating headphones with an actual lightning connector on
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.840]   it, thus indicating that they think that there is a space for this.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.960]   I have to say, the MagSafe does look to me like the first shot in a cordless phone, that the
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.400]   lightning might in fact be gone in the iPhone 13. Does that sound reasonable to you, Rosemary?
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.400]   I think there's still going to be a diagnostic part. I mean, we have one on the watch, right?
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.560]   Most people don't know where it is. It's hidden underneath one of the strap slots.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.520]   The speculation would be that they would use a smart connector like on the iPad Pro,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:21.120]   three surface flush to the surface contacts that you could then put something on.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   And I think that would get the job done. And what happens when you do that is then it's waterproof,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.480]   right? You don't have to worry about openings. Yeah, which is great.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.400]   I was hoping the HomePop Mini would be waterproof, so I could use it in the
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.960]   sharp, but it's not. Maybe any iPhone 13. She wants to take it in the shower. She loves it so much.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   The other, quickly, the other advantage though of having a truly portless iPhone is that it would
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:51.840]   allow Apple to finally get rid of that weakness that allows third parties to develop black boxes
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.960]   for law enforcement that allows them to prove to brute force backwards.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.000]   Yeah, but they could, you know what? There will be, as Rosemary says, you have to have a diagnostic
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.760]   port. So that those three pins, the smart connector, probably some cell bright will
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.760]   well to figure out. But they would be free to develop a brand new dock connector with this
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.280]   vulnerability in mind to make sure that whatever trick they pull to use the port to get to,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.520]   keep resetting the number of guesses that you get, make sure that at least they'd have to start
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.280]   all over again to figure out a new mechanism. I hope you're right. Actually, it's really not
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.720]   for this show, but probably we'll talk about it on Twit and Twig. Both the US, Congress, and
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.680]   legislatures around the world are now really starting to push for back doors in crypto.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:45.040]   That seems to be all of a sudden a very big push, and I have a feeling that that's
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.440]   going to solve that whole issue entirely. But that's for another show, for another day.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:55.680]   MagSafe charger is 39 bucks. It doesn't come with a charger either, by the way.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.800]   You still need to get something to plug that Type-C connector cable into.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.360]   But that's the thing, isn't it? All these spare chargers that people might have floating around
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.680]   at home aren't going to work with the new iPhone because the new iPhone ships with a USB-C cable.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.880]   So people are going to have to use the old cables as well as the old chargers.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.040]   But the good news is if you use anybody else's technology, you probably have Type-C chargers
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   lying around. I would hope so. At least for your iPad Pro or your MacBook.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.280]   The adapters for these things are super cheap. You can get a four-pack for 10 bucks.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.480]   But one thing that I really liked about this, the whole concept of the USB,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.320]   like the chargers being missing, whatever, recently when I remodeled the house, I changed
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.520]   every single socket to have USB ports in it. Smart. Type-A though.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   And every single one of them, yeah, they're all Type-A, but it's very easy to adapt these
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.960]   nowadays. I have a little bag of USB-
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.800]   See adapter charger things, but is this something about the C?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.320]   I like it better. It's just easier not wearing a button up and down. You can plug that sucker
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:08.560]   in in the dark. I mean, I have the iPad, the new Sony camera, all of my computers,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   like everything's all USB-C/thunderbolt. I love to make that distinction because people forget
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.120]   that on Apple, they're actually thunderbolt ports, which are way stronger. I hate when they
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   belittle them and call them USB-C ports. I just bought four of these on Prime Day at 31 bucks.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.880]   Each, these are the new, this is the new GAN stuff, which means they can be very small. These are
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:39.920]   100 watt Type-C powered PD is the power delivery. So this could charge a MacBook Pro 16. This could
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.440]   charge your iPhone. This could charge anything because it's 100 watts up to 100 watts, which means
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.760]   any laptop as well. And I figure I just have these all over the place, right? And then
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.480]   have the appropriate cable and that's all you really need. And Apple is including the cable.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.640]   I just bought the hybrid juice version, original Kickstarter one, and then they came out with
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.480]   a new Kickstarter right now that's running their stackable. And it's that same 100 watt GAN. So
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.920]   I already have two of the original hybrid juice ones. And then now I ordered four of the next ones
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.320]   that are coming because they're light and it's stronger than the MacBook one. And they're great
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.640]   for when you get to travel again. And it doesn't get hot. And it doesn't get hot.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:25.760]   And it's so much more efficient. So again, is this gallium nitride technology that we've
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.720]   been waiting for has been coming slowly. Anchor did a few GAN drive a few anchors,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.360]   GAN chargers. I love them. And the Aussie now is just 100 watt. I didn't know that you could get
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   there's other companies too. So that's cool. I think I got a press release from Anchor the
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.840]   other day with their their latest GAN charger, which is just like a million watt charger. And
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.880]   it really does look like the little marshmallow like free USB charge used to get with an iPhone.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.480]   It's remarkable. It's it's I'm not at the point where it really is. I would like to
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.400]   I would like to start replacing all of my high powered bricks with with with GAN chargers.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.840]   If only because it'll it'll block your ports. It's easier to put into wherever I get. And also
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   it's just as a nerd. It's just cooler. I think it's interesting that Apple's decided to say,
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.880]   well, we've got magnets. We could also have magnetic accessories. Yeah, love this. So there's
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:23.680]   this and in Rosemary, you said you really want this the little wallet. Yeah. Yeah, because I mean,
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:29.440]   I have some teeny tiny handbags that will fit the new iPhone. This is for clubbing. The young
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.400]   people use these for clubbing. It's more case of why do I need to carry cards? I need like my
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.200]   driver's license and a card just in case my iPhone and my Apple watch run out of battery.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.720]   Right. But I've literally left the house before with nothing but my Apple watch managed to purchase
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.960]   the stuff I needed and come home with it. So right. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah, because you
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.280]   because you have the touch to pay. So you have all your cards in there. You just really need your
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.360]   papers, your papers, please. You're just I worry though, it's just a magnet holding my driver's
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.160]   license in that card slide. What it could could it just slide off? We'll have to see how strong
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.760]   they'll probably have something sort of grippy inside. But I mean, you really need to carry
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   your driver's license and an extra card for unlocking doors. Oh, that's right.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.040]   Just put your lock pick in there. Your lock pick card. Yeah.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   You're so bad, Doc Ruck. I mean, Swiss Army knife people sell credit card size, you know,
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:28.640]   toolkits. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're credit card size to the lock picks. That's a very lovely
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.520]   thing to have. Yes. Everyone should have that little bump. Those may double those eight.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:43.760]   The they said, and I don't know exactly what it means that the phone knows if it's on or not.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:51.440]   So, yeah, that's an interesting. Smart connector. Yeah. Yeah. There was a whole like exploded view
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.080]   of what it's what's what's inside there. That's making this all work. And it really is multiple
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.800]   coils, multiple magnets, multiple everything. I was I was left wondering if they have some sort
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.640]   given that they made of one of the most exciting things for me about this part of the announcement
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.480]   was not that. And wow, we don't if you if you didn't like any of our other $130 cases,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.520]   we have a brand new line of $130 cases that use a special technology that this is something that
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.760]   they're allowing or actually encouraging other designers and third parties to take advantage of.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:26.320]   And not only just simply, oh, why, by all means, let your let your your iPhone case or your your
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.440]   lens kit or your little tripod or your little stand magnetically adhere to the back of our thing,
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:38.720]   but also allow the iPhone to be able to recognize that this specific thing has been added and
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.880]   and do and react accordingly. They had one thing they didn't demo, but they of course,
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:48.000]   they showed of a case that had a little cut out for the actual time on the always on screen.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.840]   And that's not that's not necessarily a new thing because there have been lots of tricks
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.680]   in the Android world of trying to make that happen with magnets on the on the front of their thing.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.840]   But the ability to simply say that I can sense that I can sense that there's a special sort of
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:09.280]   case installed in here. So therefore, imagine a company making sure that a certain QR code that
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.640]   people need to pass from one place to another is always exposed or imagined. There's what I
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.440]   it's not so much exact exact examples I can come up with as the idea of open. I've always felt that
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.320]   the only the only way to maximize the coolness of your technology is to allow people who had
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:33.920]   nothing to do with development to create additional coolness for it. To say the idea that I would
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.360]   love if a year from now Apple is showing off at a keynote or marketing event something that they
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.760]   never ever pictured in a million cajillion years someone would use this simple magnetic case
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:52.320]   technology to do. And yet it's something that that totally transforms the iPhone and raises its
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:58.640]   level of awesomeness and other two or three notches. This is part of what makes the
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.960]   iPhone more flexible the ability to make it into my iPhone and not to not only not just
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.520]   customize it with cases but now it's almost like we have an expansion like a hardware expansion bus
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.400]   that we can clip onto the back of it. Let's take a little break when we come back more to talk about
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.760]   lots more to talk about. Apple shows real discipline now with these prerecorded events
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.960]   exactly an hour and they left. I mean there's a ton of material they could have covered they
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.760]   didn't talk about Face ID at all. Some people are a little disappointed that there is no fingerprint
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:36.800]   reader in this day of masks and COVID it would be nice perhaps to offer that but no. There's a
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.960]   lot of stuff they didn't talk about they didn't talk about the what's in the notch and all that
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.520]   but we will talk about as many things as we know about when we come back. Rosemary Orchard is
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:55.920]   filling in here for Renee Richie it's nice to have you Rosemary. She is the queen of Apple
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:04.160]   automation and shortcuts and to plug your podcast. Well I host automators on Really FM with David
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.040]   Sparks which is all about automation and nested folders with Scotty Jackson. Excellent stuff Relay
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.640]   dot FM. I believe Mr. Ennaco has a show there but we won't talk about the fact that it's all about
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.960]   Android. Call material. Okay the beast only appears if you say the three times. Are you going to get
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.720]   an iPhone Andy? I got to say I'm sure we'll be talking about things like the cameras on the
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:33.600]   iPhone Pro later on but it really did get my taste buds tingling about the stuff that the the
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.920]   phone and we'll talk about it as later I know but this is the sort of additional features that would
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.400]   make me if I were intending to come in with $700 for an iPhone 12 would maybe thank $300 for camera
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:51.200]   a camera upgrade of this scale is very very intriguing not only that but it's also as someone who is
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   of by now probably a 10 year Android user but also still like a daily iPhone user and an iPhone
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:06.320]   lover like yeah if the if you've got the computational ability of Android Google phone camera but also
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   the hardware to back it up. Maybe maybe I should maybe I should own a 12 pro just for research purposes
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.040]   to make sure that my skill set and knowledge about the iPhone remains current at all times.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.480]   I think you have a accountant. Good justification yes and Doc Rock who's here
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:31.760]   youtube.com/docrock he's a YouTube star. It's great to have him filling in for Laurie Gill who is
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.320]   Laurie and Renee of course I don't know they're hobnobbing with Tim Cook or something I don't know
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:44.000]   there. Okay I'll admit it I just I decided initially that I was going to like be 20 minutes late so I just
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.840]   look like a big shot whom I've got a private briefing after the event. Actually I think the reason
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.360]   Laurie's not here is she's covering Amazon Prime Day I think yeah she's a little bit little busy with
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:00.080]   that on imore.com but I bet you Renee's getting a briefing I'm just I'm just thinking that might be
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.040]   our show. I feel a big shot to my to my friends and relatives. Hey at least Danny we got invitations
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.440]   to watch the stream right? There you go yeah yeah and down the street the lady who runs the liquor
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:17.600]   store where I buy bags of ice she she recognizes me and I think about the new phone. How's the new
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:24.320]   phone Andy? I think Andy the problem is Tim Cook's just jealous of your sideburns. It's obvious.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.880]   Thank you it's obvious. I didn't want to say it because it would have sounded
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:35.680]   egotistical. I showed they brought to you by Zipp recruiter. Oh man if this is a tough time if you're
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.400]   looking for work and if your employer hiring is challenging we got to think about social distancing
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.600]   and supplying masks and all that you shouldn't make hiring any harder than it has to be. Fortunately
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.360]   there's Zipp recruiter even before quarantine it was the way we did our hiring it's the easiest
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:59.760]   fastest best way to hire one of the things I love about Zipp recruiter is once you post your job
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.360]   listing on Zipp recruiter it automatically goes to more than a hundred job boards so you're reaching
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.880]   you're as well as social media by the way you're reaching out to the largest possible pool of
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:16.080]   applicants and don't fear that because all of those applications are fed into the Zipp recruiter
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.920]   interface they don't come to your phone or your email box they go into the Zipp recruiter interface
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.680]   they reformat the resumes so they're easy to scan you can have your own screening questions true
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.200]   false yes no even essay or multiple choice so that you can eliminate the candidates that just don't
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:37.040]   meet your criteria right away they also will highlight the best candidates moving to the top
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.520]   and Zipp recruiter does something extra special because people come to Zipp recruiter looking for
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:49.280]   work it's a great job site they have hundreds of thousands of current resumes they use AI to scan
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.960]   through the resumes look at your posting and when there's a match and capabilities to say to the
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.320]   applicant hey you should be hiring you should be applying for this job this job fits your needs
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.120]   fits your skills and as a result with Zipp recruiter and I can I can vouch for this
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:11.520]   you're going to get qualified listings the same day very fast I remember the last time we used Zipp
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.800]   recruiter we were looking for a bookkeeper actually wasn't the last time but a couple of times ago
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.480]   we were looking for a bookkeeper Lisa was devastated because when our bookkeeper gave us
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.720]   give her notice she said oh now I have to do all the work so you know that's what happens right
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.680]   if you're a small business you got an opening it means more work for you and you got to do the job
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.800]   search but not with Zipp recruiter she posted it at breakfast we were talking about it before lunch
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.920]   within an hour or two she's starting to get and she lives all you know people who want the job and
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.000]   she's looking at them and she's going hey this one's good this was really good this was great
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.920]   this is how Monica Starks found her latest employee maybe you saw this in the tv she needs to hire
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.840]   for a pivotal role in her construction company gs group she's having a really hard time finding
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.040]   the right person so many candidates out there she Monica switched to Zipp recruiter because
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.440]   they make not only make hiring easy but they also identify people with the right experience for
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.640]   your job and invite them to apply that's how she found Lamont Jenkins Monica says Zipp recruiter sent
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.560]   Lamont's profile to her five minutes after she posted her job because he was such a great match
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.840]   for the role I can't promise your hire is going to be five minutes away but Zipp recruiter is so
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.880]   effective that four out of five employers who post on Zipp recruiter get a quality candidate within

[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:16.560]   zipp recruiter customer we use them and we love them zipp recruiter.com/macbreak a little pricing
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:26.720]   note on these phones I should mention in some cases the pricing they're talking about is carrier
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:33.280]   offers so nine to five Mac pointed this out very quickly you remember apple said the iPhone 12
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:40.240]   from 799 well that's only only if you're buying from 18 t and Verizon and using one of their special
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:48.560]   offers sprint T mobile or unlocked 829 is the starting price that's only 30 bucks more but it's
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:55.280]   just something to be aware of that in this kit and again I don't understand really why apple they
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:01.680]   don't need to get in the back pockets of these carriers they certainly don't need the money
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:09.760]   and they're so dominant at least in the US they don't need to any special relationship to get in
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.400]   the phone stores but they're but they're doing it for some reason they're they're they're they're
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:22.320]   caving into Verizon in 18 t I think I think I understand this um again the hashtag think okay
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:30.880]   folks don't get nasty um it's on the it's on the 12 in the 12 mini right not the pro or the pro
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:40.000]   max no it's on the lower tier phones and you know I know it's only 30 dollars but in in the say
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.360]   small small market I don't know the proper word is now because my brain just went dumb but um you
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:50.880]   know in the say low cost entry market or whatever like your boost mobile type you know carriers
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:57.680]   whatever they're trying to be competitive with that type of stuff and so they're given an entry way
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:04.480]   in for maybe someone you know say less affluent to do it and go through the old school models of the
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:11.040]   way phones and plans were right because you know if you do it through what you carry as your in for
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.560]   two years right yep so maybe maybe that's the only reason why is it try to offer some
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.800]   I guess cost effective way for someone to do it I don't know like personally I would never go back
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.040]   to that model that model was so bad for us and most people never did the math but I think one
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:36.000]   of the long time ago we figured this out in this show that um the old AT&T model you were 2,400
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.560]   bucks into an i4 3g answer four right because your bill does not go down when the cost exactly
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.840]   keep that in mind they stop charging you for the phone once you've paid it off you're paying for
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:58.160]   life yeah the phone companies are scumbags I don't mind saying it and I'm meaning I'm a little
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.240]   sad that apple has kind of gotten in their back pocket at least the phone doesn't say for rising on
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:12.000]   it I hope oh apple's always been in the way yeah apple's always been really really good about just
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.760]   allowing that kind of logo that's all yeah
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.480]   yeah there will be a startup logo and there will be I'm sure those I don't know will they
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.600]   have Verizon apps on there that's one of the problems with Android is you get
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.200]   15 red apps when you buy a phone from the Verizon blockbuster movie rental store yeah
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:35.440]   apple's always resisted that but I'm starting to wonder if their if their spine has gotten a little
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.400]   softer well you do have been so carry apps sometimes right in order to use the e-sim
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:48.080]   do I maybe you do in the UK I think in some cases some providers you have to install the the app
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.040]   so that you can actually get the e-sim in the first place I think that's how it works because I
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.800]   know that I've been looking around like trying to figure out the e-sim options and it seemed
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.880]   like there were none and then I found out for some people you need to install apps and then
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.680]   you can get the e-sim I use the e-sim option right now was me and I didn't have to install an app
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.240]   I think in the US you don't have to I think it depends on the provider yeah it could very much be
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.920]   the provider so I use AT&T and the reason why I went for the recent map is because before you
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.200]   know we were able to move around I like having the pocket open so when I go to Japan I literally
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:27.280]   get off the plane walk straight to the desk and buy a Japanese Sim's pop in a Sim put it put it
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.880]   into the empty pocket and then boom before I catch the train in my hotel I'm connected you know so
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:39.600]   I purposely put my AT&T account on the e-sim to leave that pocket open so no matter where you go
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.840]   you can just drop the Sim and keep it in effect you have a dual sim phone without having two sim
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.760]   slots that's a good idea yeah yeah I bought the Hong Kong version of the iPhone 10s max I would
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.080]   have two physical sim card slots because over here in Europe there are way fewer providers with e-sim
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:00.640]   capability I believe in the UK we have one or possibly two and that's not the cheap carriers
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.960]   that's the expensive ones where you're overpaying whereas I'm paying like 10 bucks a month 30
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.080]   you have you on Rosemary because one of the unfortunate things about all of our shows is we
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:15.360]   have a US bias and we forget that there's other markets and there's other ways to do this so thank
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.200]   you for being here and representing you're not living in Austria anymore did you move back home
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.320]   no I move back to the UK at the start of a global pandemic which is a great time to move house if
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:29.360]   anybody is considering yeah that's perfect time I know but wouldn't Oscar wouldn't Vienna be a
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.720]   nice place to be a global pandemic you can get I mean you get soccer taught delivered to your door
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:40.560]   for crying out loud yes yes there is that advantage but being back here and closer to friends and
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.200]   family who I was able to see at a distance even though I wasn't actually able to see them for quite
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   some time I don't understand that so we're talking about the apple announcement the new iPhone is
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:58.800]   here I should also mention that there were some things conspicuously absent from today's announcement
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   they didn't announce air tags apple tags whatever they didn't mention anything about a new apple
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:13.840]   TV there were no new headphones in fact I was convinced because the I guess the beats section of
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.880]   the store was down yesterday oh this is it gonna be it they're gonna rebrand everything apple
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:28.240]   nothing no apple studio air pods I called it I called it you know last podcast we yeah we had
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.880]   this conversation on our last show and BTN which is funny because I'm the opposite of Rosemary
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.120]   on that show I'm the American on the British podcast until Andy shows up and then he's the
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   American on the British podcast and I'm the guy in Hawaii so the furthest point is for the furthest
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:51.440]   point west there you go correct way out west I like to I told everyone that this iPhone thing
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:58.160]   is so important right now and because apple is doing these pre-recorded and concise sort of things
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.960]   without you don't have to do the event the way you used to do because you don't need to fly
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.160]   everybody to a room right there to sit there and do the ooze and oars and applause and you know
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.680]   live blogging all that didn't have to exist so you could do an event every month for every product
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:19.360]   and it's actually in a way maybe better for the product let the product stand alone and breathe
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.360]   you know well this is such an important product for them I think you're exactly right the iPhone
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:28.400]   announcement is it right that's their number one product they didn't know but things that we're
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.720]   waiting on they didn't mention the iPad airs a next month order date it's just next months they
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:41.360]   didn't they didn't say anything about apple one their new service package so I guess we all know
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.760]   that there's going to be a Mac event next month mark german wrote this in bloomberg he hit it in
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:51.840]   the middle of an article at the bottom but I mean now it's clear there's got to be another event
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.680]   there's another student for big sir and for Christmas shopping in my opinion this this is my
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.520]   opinion on friday on our podcast you're right those are better suited for big sir better suited
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.240]   for Christmas shopping and things like that and I think the only reason why home pod even came in
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:12.720]   today is because new echoes also dropped today so they're only they're pretty much only competition
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:18.560]   because they're not so no still get it twisted um is the is the new echo so echo no and the google
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:25.200]   nest mini and in google right so drop them both today and is perfect timing uh it's a
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.320]   ruff it's an apple did one that no one will ever expect it this is for you rosemary it's the same
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.160]   price as the new echo so yeah the new nest mini it's 99 bucks yeah it's not apple text you know it's
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:43.520]   not 129 for no reason and it looks like a scented candle and there's enough time for people to hear
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.200]   about it before christmas so the the impulse buy is not the the thing that you probably didn't want
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.600]   that grandma has enough time to go although the apple thing the the amazon thing or the google thing
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.680]   and where do i go get it this is another thing you can't order till november 6th and you won't get
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.040]   it till november 16th so it's going to be close but i think this is apple's strategy change you know
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:08.560]   i they were really proud of the home pod they talked so much about the design and how they could get
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:13.680]   so much music out of such a small package and it was a flop it didn't have it it did only had
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:21.120]   no they had no other music services syri wasn't so smart uh i think it was too expensive at 499
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.840]   so this is this is kind of a reimagining of the home pod i think they don't even
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:32.800]   expect to sell many more of the big brother they they hope instead of buying one home pod you'll buy
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.920]   five home pod minis because you can pair them you can spread them right throughout the house
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.080]   and honestly i don't know about you rosemary i know you really like this you want to put it in
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:50.000]   your bathroom but i think the real selling point is intercom here intercom only goodness tell us
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.280]   our tweet from steve equino about intercom and how it's huge for accessibility because you don't
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.680]   need to know where somebody is to be able to talk to them and ask them a question or for help or
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.480]   something and that is amazing i did not think about that and as soon as you tweeted it was like
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.440]   of course of course this is great for accessibility and if you live with other people being able to
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:15.520]   just communicate and it goes to arabodson carplay as well that that is amazing they showed in the
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:22.560]   event they showed dad driving home with pizza on his carplay telling everybody pizzas on its way
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:30.160]   get ready uh using the intercom feature that could be incredibly annoying but at the same time
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:37.120]   kind of cool i'm gonna get my face in the car are you yeah yeah it's a mom and parents a home
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:42.160]   pod mini yeah then and then i'm gonna try and hook it into my network so that then i can randomly
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.800]   say things so that's rickal can the morning i have to warn you uh echo had this it's called they call
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:52.880]   it drop in and i use this with my mom and she used it with me it scared the hell out of her
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.240]   and we stopped we turned that video off i also should point out that
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:07.040]   that echos had an intercom feature and so i put an echo in our my steps on my 18 year old's room
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.360]   so i could say get up it's not a school or you know come to breakfast or whatever
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.480]   and he immediately unplugged it and threw it away i don't know what he did with it it's
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:21.040]   disappeared so there are people who don't want mom and dad's voice in the in the in the house
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.280]   in the bedroom right i'm wondering if the anticon system is also going to work without a home pod
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:30.240]   in play because oh you know i could see because i've tried you know i was staying with my parents
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.000]   for a couple of months after i moved back and a lot of the time we ended up using the walkie
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.280]   talkie feature on apple watch which everybody can that right exists yeah because it's awful
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.040]   like my dad could be out in the garden and then he could say hey could you come hold this piece of
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.160]   timber for me and i could say back i'm in a meeting uh can you wait 20 minutes right um or you know
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.880]   just go down there and hold a piece of timber that he needed help with cutting or whatever um so
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.560]   you know it would be great if it works without that i'd love to see if that so actually because
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.400]   you're a home automation guru i thought uh you'd be a perfect perfect person to talk about this
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.320]   one of the things apple has done i think is super smart is they put home kit in everything if you
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:15.840]   buy an apple tv or a home pod i presume the home pod mini that's a base station for home kit right
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:22.640]   yeah i think they mentioned it yeah the only thing that it has right a little bit is you can't
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:27.360]   choose which one is going to be your hub so i have two home pods and i have an ethernet connected
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:32.480]   apple tv and it's picked one of my home pods oh as my hub hub and i would much prefer to use the
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:40.720]   ethernet connected apple tv yeah but no it doesn't want to do that so um so the idea of this is they
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:45.920]   come in black and white they look like a senate candle they even light up on the top although i
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:52.000]   think that's just seery talking did they i it should be a music like organ like a color organ for the
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.400]   music is it i don't think so i think i think they did indicate that when you bring the when you bring
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.040]   the phone near that there was some sort of synchronization between the light display i i seem to recall
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.240]   there was some sort of a synchronization between the light display you're seeing on the phone the light
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.880]   display you're seeing on the device uh because they did say handoff is coming so that this is a
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.240]   cool feature you walk into the room this isn't available yet but you walk into the room it says oh
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.840]   leo just walked in the room play the music here instead of there if it follows around the house
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:26.160]   we can just tap our our phones on top of a home pod and it will hand off the playback or if the
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.960]   home pod is playing any tap your iPhone on it it'll pull the playback onto your device which is great
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.640]   if you're walking out the door i may have got i may have misunderstood but i got the impression you
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:39.040]   didn't have to tap anymore that it just follows you i'm i'm a little wary about not having to tap
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.360]   it because if i just walk through a room so i've got a home pod in here in my office i've got a home
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:47.040]   pod in my living room and if i have to go through the living room to get to the kitchen if i walk
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.880]   through the living room i don't want the home pod in the living room to steal my playback
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:57.760]   but yeah but the music follows you around rosmer i yeah but in which of this is i want you to write
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:06.560]   me a shortcut that plays my theme when i walk into the room now that well that is potentially doable
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.520]   but they didn't announce the feature i was hoping for which is that the new apple watch
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.480]   and home pop mini would let you know where you are in your home because that would be amazing
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.160]   if it really knew where you are that's the u1 chip this is the ultra wide band u1 chip and i think
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.960]   this is this is why everybody presumed air tags was imminent is this capability to kind of look
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:35.600]   you know but will people be paranoid about this or will this be well it's apple so it's
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.640]   as they said many times secure and private all it has to do is work really really well i think
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.360]   google and facebook google google particularly has demonstrated that if you give a service that is
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.400]   so good you can't imagine life without it they don't mind giving up some privacy about it particularly
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.920]   if the privacy restrictions are a little bit obscure uh it's going to be apple apple has as
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.000]   part of its brand security and privacy those are really important but as the original version of
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.280]   the home pod demonstrated it doesn't matter if you've got the greatest design in the world
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.400]   doesn't matter if you have the most profound aesthetic doesn't mean that if it doesn't matter if you've
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.120]   got a demonstration this wonderful and echo chamber that proves how much better your 500
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.280]   dollar speaker sounds than anything else if it doesn't work for the if it's not useful if it
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.240]   doesn't work for a purpose that has been intended your your 500 dollar best-in-class smart speaker
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.360]   is going to get its butt kicked by the 30 dollar puck sized devices from amazon and google that are
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.040]   being practically given away with every with every time you buy a large pizza yeah and what you know
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   they did say that with the new um pot was that's kind of been there before but they kind of amplified
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.640]   it or talking about the private identifier so when you say hey s lady can you x y z or whatever
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.360]   it doesn't say that this is dog from cock-awko asking you a question it just says there's some
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.400]   random dude over there wants to know you know you know i mean so they're not they're not saying
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.720]   it's you they're not pulling your information away to other devices because when they demonstrated
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.880]   that syria understands who you are which voice yeah it knows who you are but the okay so the actual
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:12.960]   package in the demonstration converting it said okay john that's i love that that is so serene
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.680]   rose you tiny but i never will give an interface tweak but so but the fact that no wait wait hold on
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.320]   though i want to understand what dog saying so okay so syria knows it's little right yeah syria
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.760]   knows difference in you and the because it knows my voice is much sexier yes right but then the
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.680]   package itself before it goes out it takes my question yeah it compresses it into its special
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   anonymized i see what you're saying it sends that yeah it sends back the answer and then yeah but
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.800]   then it does say doc here's your answer because it it acknowledges that it heard a different voice
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.200]   but that's all local yeah yeah that's local your device but it is important though that we do get a
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.400]   you know move room to room and then have the theme play because i'm going to use a hoverboard
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.160]   you're going to be in the gangster right i'm going to have the hoverboard and apple juice
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.200]   instead of cranberry juice and play flea wood back dream dreams gonna follow you everywhere
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.680]   it's seen a hoverboard with 23 and frames before but it works it's spinners spinners really make
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.480]   that pull up hey spinners is it man as long as mine looks like the mini flying delorean
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.760]   sorry any interrupted you i'm sorry no i'm sorry no i was i almost derailed you i'm sorry
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.160]   but i i think that's such a brilliant thing because part of this is another thing that i don't think
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.960]   apple really understood at the outset about a smart system uh google put so much effort into
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.480]   just making that voice sound as good as possible putting inflections in it putting character into
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.200]   it and also making sure that's responses were mixed up a little bit and also very very kindly
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.440]   tailored to what you would ask a real person the room to do uh the the s words uh schlomo because
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.600]   i don't want to trigger to what trigger devices people listening to this but schlomo just never
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.360]   never really ingratiated itself to me uh for the first few years because it was just effective
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.560]   as opposed to personable and when you start when you start to do things like uh you you
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.360]   given that every single time you activate schlomo you see you're addressing it by name and say hey schlomo
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.400]   give me what's this information to have schlomo address hi Andy well the weather today is going
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.480]   to be like this that is a little bit more that's more personable that makes it cool sort of connect
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   to it a little better and also it's suddenly it's a security feature because given that they're
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.320]   putting so much oomph and features into the ability to say oh i recognize this voice and so if this
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:34.720]   voice asks me for my messages i know to give it Andy's messages and not giarmos messages uh it
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.240]   has to basically say oh wait a minute i i'm not i'm not constantine is it about to is it about to
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.840]   tell me constantines messages to bleep no schlomo don't tell me constantines messages it's Andy
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:52.400]   remember i'm Andy but so there's so much that that's uh employ assistance are such the epitome of
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.680]   good effective design because it's these little things you can no longer put a flashing red led
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.480]   to tell you you've got messages waiting you have to have a way of interacting and indicating
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.040]   without being too explicit about it and without demanding people's attention and that is such a
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.520]   high level of sophistication that very few hardware and software designers in history have ever had
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.440]   to confront it'll be interesting to see if apple can convince people that they are more secure more
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.320]   private one of the reasons i know lots of people who won't have amazon echoes or google assistance
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.200]   in their house consider just really don't like the idea of amazon and google having a microphone
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.280]   and or a camera in there but really what what the pitch of the uh i would say of the home pod
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:40.720]   many is have one everywhere in every room absolutely yeah absolutely and that part is there and i
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:49.120]   think andy is onto a very key point in the infliction and the tonality from the g assistant is so good
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:56.000]   that it just sounds nice to listen to um the a lady also her afflictions and stuff her tonality
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.240]   is a little bit better there is a uh a current video that i saw one of my friends make that they
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.920]   had serie wrapping versus the a lady wrapping and the a ladies rap she got bars she straight got bars
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:17.760]   and she's got kind of amazing yes so the concept of putting one in each room again it just makes
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:23.040]   the connectivity better yeah it's going to also i mean not just for the smarter system but even the
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.160]   the blankening the sounds of your home with some lovely Hawaiian music you know to keep you in the
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:34.640]   mood i love that and and andy can play along with his ukulele you know um i i i need any next time
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.640]   you're out i'll take you to my friend who makes ukulele's you'll fall in love because i know you do love them
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   um but just the idea of that you know that that it works but it's also functional because you
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.720]   have a nice you know music playing throughout and then you're able to intercom and you're able to
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.000]   you know check various statuses throughout the day for various thing that you do and if that color
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.360]   at the top can tell me i have an important message like karsten hitting me up to ask me the sub for
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:08.240]   lori again like i wanted to show a different color on the top versus you know what i'm saying i hope
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:15.760]   that's accessible rosemary can raise some shortcuts for that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.440]   oh my god doc you'll never guess who called you
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:29.680]   serious we're giving seria a lot more credit she's way behind google and amazon uh and as noted today
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.920]   in the keynote where my home pod went sorry i didn't get that about 80 000 times i can look that up on
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.680]   the web for you uh her voice she doesn't have any variation in the voice you can get a male or a
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.280]   female but you know well actually i have an i i have a very nice irish voice i like a nice irish lady
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:53.840]   somebody said you can get scottish as a choice i wish you could have squished i'd be great uh it also
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.040]   seems to be a little dumber this feature of distinguishing voices google's had for a while
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.400]   although i have to say uh it's hard to access and it doesn't work all that well if apple can make
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.640]   that work better this is a video shot by lexy sevetes at cnet she apparently has been testing
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.960]   this in her home to show you the size it is not big there's an apple tv it's about the same
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.280]   footprint as an apple tv tv it's just a smaller bowling call uh 10 pin it looks like a you know
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.320]   candle pin yeah it looks like candle pin or maybe a softball it's maybe like the size of a softball
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.720]   i'm i'm very i'm very proud of the two new englanders in this conversation instantly said yeah
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.680]   candle pin yeah yeah oh yeah i play candle pin oh yeah
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:44.080]   actually that's that's very that's very fitting because because you know schlomo is so far behind
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.440]   it really does need to get three balls eating frames or two to knock down the fins that's super
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.760]   funny now they're inside joke for you new englanders who are saying candle pin bowling rules i have
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.600]   always stated the reason why siri is uh i like leo's word stupider but i'll use less intelligent
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:07.120]   to be nice less sophisticated the reason why is because siri was designed with a screen as an
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.720]   answer whereas a lady and the google assistant were designed with speakers as an answer so to this day
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.800]   according to her elder lineage siri says okay here's the answer look on the screen right thanks
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.000]   mom because mom used to say that mom how do you spell constant antonoble look it up look it up i's
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.760]   like if i wanted to look it up i wouldn't ask you slap boy if you want to know how much money we spent
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.640]   send you to college so you could ask me to spell the name of confidence in the world it wasn't that
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.360]   andy it was the world books that they got sucked and interviewed oh i saw how my world
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.760]   books yeah we all had the world books and the botanicals yes we did yes we did so whatever i asked
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.520]   the question in order to get the money's worth i had to go look at that guy uh-huh right so i think
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:58.560]   because a lady was designed with a speaker playback she had to give you actual answers she couldn't
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:05.520]   say hey go look it up right and to this day siri needs to shed that that is the one portion of its
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:12.080]   you know new england accent it needs to shed because we are past that now and driving don't tell me
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.200]   to look at the screen when i'm driving you dummy what's wrong with you i've actually noted siri has
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.920]   improved a lot recently with ios 14 and driving for me um i i got a car about four months ago so i was
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.600]   still in ios 13 at the time um and then um and so i've been you know driving around and i don't have
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.480]   carplay um so i put my phone in do not disturb all driving and it's mounted so i can see the map and
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.400]   if i use the magic incantation and say hey send my mom a message or send my friend a message then
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.160]   instead of it doing what it usually does which is as your message ready to send it says back to me
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:52.240]   what it's going to send and it says would you like to send it um which is better so it is learning
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.600]   or apple is learning and putting that smart sense siri um to make that better
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.920]   i want to ask you about this rosemary because they and and uh mica picked up on it they they say that
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:12.320]   it has thread built into it is that uh that's for home kit right i think so yes i'm not 100%
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:19.120]   certain on that that if mica says so i'm going across mica yeah apple and google are uh along
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:27.040]   with amazon are in and i thought man this is like hell freezing over uh project ship which is the
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:33.120]   connected home over ip and the attempt this is part of the zigbee alliance the attempt was to get a
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:40.560]   kind of a common uh framework for all home stuff to solve the biggest problem of home automation
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.320]   which is nothing talks to anything else uh thread is part of that so i wonder if that is maybe part
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.480]   of the chip alliance uh and that apple is perhaps hoping that the home pod mini will work with
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.400]   everything else they should sell this in a six pack they should you should be able to buy bakers
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:05.360]   dozen yes cowl just three home rods three help up minis and three euro per rose or whatever it is
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:12.000]   yeah just a collection it would be nice if once or twice a year they were able to since they
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.480]   don't have a thirty dollar smart speaker it would be great if they had a way to simply say you know
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.600]   what one day or two separate days of the year we're going to eat it on these and sell them for
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.120]   for a sixty nine dollars we're gonna not kind of what amazon does right?
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:33.440]   yeah they are historically and according to a certain like 500 page congressional report that
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.760]   we've all read over the last week they're they're they're not afraid to like totally eat it and
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.600]   sell things at a dead loss if it'll put someone else out of business but i'm just talking about
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:48.240]   what i'm my experience with the amazon and google smart speakers is simply that yeah it'll be the
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.680]   first one i buy was sort of a considered thought that well you know it's 150 bucks and will it
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:59.120]   really work the way i want it to and i'm able to buy the first one and then you it's like taking
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.400]   in stray cats where you know i find that i have like one in every room and i also have like
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.680]   another one right front right on the bedside that's stupid and i literally have a tower like a wall
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:16.640]   of sound with a home pod and an echo and a google assistant i even have a cortana to make it really
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:22.800]   a nice tower but that's what what i'm getting is that one of these speakers is really really nice
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.960]   but when you get to when you find yourself in a position where i was like this morning
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.280]   where i was just going through my morning routine where whatever it was i was i wanted to listen to
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.680]   my spotify i i i i i press the button in the in the user interface to connect it to
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.800]   chromecast speakers and i have a chromecast group that's something called everything and the ability
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.960]   for me to like walk from the bedroom that has like the really nice google home max speaker
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.080]   into the bathroom where i have like the regular sized google home speaker to
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.920]   to do my do my morning shower and shave and then into the kitchen where i have another like google
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.480]   home speaker and without basically having this exact same audio experience without having to
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.040]   blast everything at 400 decibels through one thing that's the sort of thing that makes you
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:12.160]   not only is it more buy-in and make you gives you like sort of more hardware lock-in but also it
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:18.400]   really sells you on the idea of this is a whole whole house sort of service and now it doesn't matter
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.800]   i i no longer have to yell into the next room like i'm yelling at my kids say
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:29.440]   slow-mo right what's my next up i do that i do that all the time yeah yeah because you have you
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.200]   have you have you realize that you'd have to do that in the one corner of like of your office
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.400]   you're so you decided that you know what was after after after two two weeks of black friday
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   deals i got like eight free google home minis i'll put one of them like near the dresser in this
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.960]   corner where i can't where the other speaker can't hear me that is actually a point apple has a
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.840]   challenge because somebody in the chatroom said they're a luxury brand they don't you can't compare
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:00.080]   amazon or google's tech scales sales tactics with with apple i got a free google google
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:07.120]   assistant for signing up for um yeah what was it youtube tv or something or getting a
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.880]   phone or they're like throwing them at you and apple just isn't really going to do that so
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.000]   they really need to get people to say buy into the ecosystem and say look i'm an apple guy i can't
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.840]   have these echoes and assistance i gotta have uh i have to have uh schlo-mo in every room i'll just
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.360]   i'll just say very very quickly because i think this is an important point i really think that we've
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.120]   seen in the past few years another inflection point in the the history of apple and in the way
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:39.760]   that they approach business i think that three or four or five years ago was at the apex of what i
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:47.600]   would call i would even risk calling design arrogance saying okay you idiots don't understand why this
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.800]   is a perfect device and why we're only going to we're going to force you to buy this one laptop
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.520]   with a terrible with a terrible keyboard because you idiots don't understand design but don't worry
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.320]   we've made a video to show you exactly how idiots like you will understand why this is the best
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.240]   keyboard you've ever used and by the way if you don't like it anyway too bad you get it you're at
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.200]   a lot i do think i'm being a little bit extreme for the sake of comedy there but it's not far off
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.360]   i think that we're but i do i have seen the past two or three years a little bit of an opening up
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.600]   saying you know what we will make a ninety nine dollar smart speaker we will make a three hundred
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.000]   twenty nine dollar ipad of course that's both of those are because of direct competition that
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.640]   they're losing to competitors but six and one half dozen of the other they're willing to say we
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.920]   want to be the great design company but we don't want we don't we don't get so fixated on painting
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.800]   the side of the fence that nobody sees that we forget to like pull out the bent nail from the side
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.400]   that people are always going to be brushing their elbow against which has always been apple's biggest
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.000]   problem in the joseve jobs era yeah uh... remains to be seen how well they're how good they'll sound
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.240]   uh... we're all just kind of a certain of their good enough yeah they'll sound well
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.200]   the other the other thing that actually is good news is that apple has at least expanded their
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.680]   capabilities no longer for a for a long time the real problem with a home pod from my point of
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.360]   view is it only played apple music it's still not going to play spotify
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:11.840]   ever but not even on the timetable that's a that was just yeah it but they do say pandaora and
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.920]   amazon music are coming uh they have a special relationship with amazon uh and that uh you will
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:23.600]   be able to play uh podcasts and things like that so you know like if you have pandaora and apple
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.760]   and amazon music i guess that's a not an apple music i guess that's how spotify during the
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:34.560]   shortcuts integration i switch back to apple music is a good idea i don't know uh it's funny because
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.280]   i think most people all other things being equal would choose spotify
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.360]   but what happens is the ecosystem play gets you every time doesn't it
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:50.080]   yep that's why i switch back yeah so having shortcuts having its support for the speaker and
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:56.240]   all of that and i can understand why spotify is really upset with apple in fact they're one
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:03.760]   of the chief complainants in this judiciary committee's report on apple monopoly and uh you know it
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.560]   would be awesome for home kid and this might be just wishful thinking okay like say you bought that
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:15.440]   six pack leo was speaking of um and we decided hey we're going to go in and watch you know end of the
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.880]   month uh mandelorian season two kicks off and we want to watch the first episode okay everybody go
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.000]   grab a pot and bring it into the room i'm going to set up a quick you know uh five point one
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.080]   by spreading the spreading the home pods around in the living room and have them sing with the apple
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:38.240]   tv and give you that dope immersive sound dope that would be so i did just see a tweet that you
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:44.880]   can now set the apple tv output permanently to home pods that's always been an issue is that it's
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:50.720]   it works now okay good thank you people just doesn't seem like a stu uh such an stupid
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.840]   omission and google still doesn't get it it's frustrating that i if i if i look over in my office
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.400]   i i'm telling you i'm looking at a screen that has uh the the new google chrome cast with a google
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.880]   home max on top of the shelf on top of that tv but i can't use that as the output of the google tv
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.400]   hardware device that's running a google operating system and using a google chrome cast broadcasting
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.920]   system that's like that makes you that makes you want to just take get get your dad voice on and say
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:24.800]   i'm not angry with you google like just maybe i just shouldn't have expected so much of you
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.440]   maybe that was unfair i'm gonna take a little break and then we're gonna get to i think really
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.640]   at least from my point of view the most exciting things about the new iphone the camera
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:43.440]   the camera capabilities i am truly well as a youtuber i would expect yeah uh doc rock is here
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.840]   he's youtube.com/docrock rosemary orchard uh from rosemary orchard.com and her three wonderful
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:57.680]   podcasts and she of course of course the automation and shortcut queen and mr. Andy Naco from wgbh
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:05.840]   in boston we will continue our rundown of the apple 5g verizon event in just a bit but first
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:13.520]   a word from our sponsor last pass last pass well first of all just completely separate from the
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:20.000]   ad i just want to thank last pass this has been a tough year for us uh you know we've we've had a
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.360]   shrink our operations a little bit advertising has been a little bit light uh but last pass came
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.320]   through with studio sponsorship and uh we really appreciate they sponsored all our breaking news
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.200]   they've really helped keep uh twit on its feet and keep a good number of people employed so we thank
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:43.680]   last pass uh and we also use last pass in fact i've been using last pass since they started a dozen
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.880]   years ago steve gibson it was ten years ago steve gibson did his review of the last pass
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.240]   internals and said wow this is done right our security guy's been using it for 10 years we started
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:01.200]   using last pass at work the enterprise version about five or six years ago i've been watching last
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.920]   pass grow and it's kind of amazing when we first started doing these ads they had 35,000
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.880]   businesses using last pass enterprise that number has doubled 70,000 businesses they've doubled the
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:20.880]   number of users 25 million users they are easily the number one password manager they've also won
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:26.400]   eight awards so far this year pc magazine's editor's choice they wore they won the fortress
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   cyber security award business insiders best overall password manager but really you don't have to take
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.320]   my word for it last pass speaks for itself and if you're running a business and you aren't
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:41.760]   you're sending employees home and you're not sitting at home with last pass yikes yikes
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.120]   this remote work environment has been a real challenge for what they call identity and access
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.000]   management adjusting to an online workforce isn't just logistical it's not just getting them
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:59.280]   desks and computers and curved screen monitors it's also been a huge security issue and thank
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:06.400]   goodness for last pass we've used last pass to set up utilize and share strong passwords across
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.960]   all of their accounts we love last pass so much we actually give it to all our employees as a
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.240]   a personal version as a benefit of employee and it's not just you know that's not just a benefit
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.000]   for them it's a benefit for us we want our employees to be secure we want them to protect
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.800]   their assets as well as our business assets this is key you know the shift to working from home
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.960]   we didn't anticipate that when we moved to last pass enterprise but we sure are glad we were there
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:40.880]   that remote workforce for instance gets password sharing that's secure and safe they get ease of
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.160]   use things like single sign-on 1300 plus apps where all they have to do is say yes they don't even
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:51.280]   need a password they say yes on their phone they're logged in they're the enterprise password
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.960]   management ensures oversight of shadow it and enforceable policies across all password protected
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:02.880]   accounts that's important to we make sure that for instance there are more than 100 policies but
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.160]   one of them that we enforces our employees have to use two-factor for their master password that's
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.200]   of course that's a necessity but we enforce that we have minimum password requirements things like
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:20.000]   that goes beyond two-factor last pass also uses contextual factors to make sure that the right
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.520]   people are using the right resources at the right time things like geolocation IP address
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.920]   it's a zero knowledge security model that means no one is trusted unless they can authenticate
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.840]   with a hundred percent strong authentication that's what last pass does and and I don't need to give
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:44.240]   you all the buzzwords to AES 256 bit encryption pbkdf2 to prevent brute forcing they use salted
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:52.000]   hashes sha 256 your data is never decrypted anywhere but on your device that's the only
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   place and by the way every device you use iOS and red mac windows linux everywhere all the
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   browsers your password your master password is never transmitted anywhere off device last pass
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.480]   doesn't get it no they do it right that's what Steve Gibson found and that's why we use it last pass
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:13.680]   dot com slash twitties the burden for yourself in your remote workforce with a cyber security
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:20.640]   protection you deserve last pass dot com slash twitt thank you last pass it's been a great year
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:27.520]   you've been a great partner we really appreciate it last pass dot com slash twitt dock rock you're
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.000]   throwing out your go pros you're throwing out all your DSLRs you're getting rid of the cannon the
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.320]   night con the sony it's all apple iphone all the time right you first dumpster dirty dot
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:45.200]   rucks house you're swearing at me with all those words except sony i'm a sony guy too i know what
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.000]   you mean so so yeah so here's why this is a big deal um i'm i'm a e-cam guy right i teach e-cam
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.440]   on my stream i tell everybody if you just want to start it's the easiest way to do it yeah one of the
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.120]   coolest features of e-cam is you can just plug in an iphone and it immediately works so if you
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.920]   want to start you have no other cameras but your iphone the fact that you can just cable it up
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.720]   right away with the standard lightning cable and you're good to go it's amazing now you take that
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:21.040]   and you add in this new camera you add in this hdr 10 bit on the fly shooting oh my goodness now
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:26.640]   tell me because tell me what that means is it's incredible stuff as a videographer they said and
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:36.720]   to me this sounded amazing 60 frame per second 4k HDR 10 bit with Dolby vision now that's five buzz
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:49.840]   words in there but all at the same time is that good yes yes so uh your bit your bit definition
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:57.040]   covers a bunch of different things i'm primarily uh we're looking at dynamic range and we're talking
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:03.120]   about dynamic range on all the levels of the bits right so one of your forces your RGBs one of your
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.840]   forces to use saturation and luminance right one of your force is based off of depth color
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:17.120]   basically you know it's your dynamic range right your shadows and your highlights and things like
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.640]   that so the more bits you store the more information about the senior story absolutely absolutely and
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   so therefore you have more ability to when you go to edit sad photo or edit sad video you have more
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:37.040]   that you're working with this is why we all love raw so when you're shooting in say video raw on
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.240]   on any camera or things like the black magic camera and stuff like that wait a minute wait a minute
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:49.280]   it's still compressed right you can't shoot raw video and for the iPhone it will be compressed
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.760]   yes it is straight raw video is it 4 4 4 yeah no no you wouldn't have been wearing for it
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:01.280]   yeah it that that itself it will burn out so it is going to probably be in the atic codec or the
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.080]   xavc codec which is still somewhat but these are very good though these are good code yes no
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.520]   you watch it all day mp5 yeah even think about it you know what i'm saying say yeah we're we're
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.600]   beyond the days of squashing something down uh or squeeze as my friend diana would say
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:24.560]   squeezing things down to you know like the mp3 original mp3 format it just sounds like rubbish
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.760]   i mean we're at a whole different game and space with compression and things like that now and
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:36.640]   the fact that for the most part you could take what is the proxy footage out of you know a sony
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.440]   camera how you can shoot dual mode you can take the proxy footage edit it and throw it up online and
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.400]   nobody would even notice nobody would care yes maybe like oh this is great so yes like to do
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:52.320]   want to do this with an iphone though i mean bro i wish i could return my go pro i just got
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:59.520]   the hero whatever i hate black you can't you didn't get it from casko because honestly i don't
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.800]   know if i need it anymore this iphone it sounds like you know what i was waiting for at the end
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.640]   they didn't do it but i was waiting for happen to say and by the way this entire presentation
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:15.680]   was shot on iphone um but they didn't do that yeah that that um video in your okay let's get
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.000]   the straight people do not get it twisted you're not going to get your iphone home
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.760]   and shoot what they shot there okay okay the number one thing that they have that you do not have
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.440]   okay you can buy a home for or as a osmo mobile for you can buy a movie uh cinema robot you can get
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.480]   that balance you can get all of that covered but they're bringing 10k light you know uh
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:43.600]   big HDMI light right so even the stuff that they shot at night there's probably some practical light
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:49.520]   somewhere to give it that extra boost but you can do that right now prime day if you don't buy
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.880]   anything you're into video creation buy lights don't buy anything else everything else is not
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.720]   going to help you light is boom like this light right here that gives me that all of this you
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.680]   know jennison saquah you know that's like a fifteen hundred dollar light but it's because
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.960]   when you go to stream it looks good right you can make this old ugly dude look good yeah so
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:18.080]   that in a Boston hat come on i'm i'm really excited i mean that's one thing and i have to say at this
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:23.840]   point with with google kind of you know they they left the image processing hardware out of the
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:30.080]   new pixel five i feel like they're in effect kind of saying yeah go ahead apple and and you
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.280]   could say well what about samson samson has a lot of capability but they are very opinionated
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:41.120]   about what they do to your photography and i think unless you like that samson look
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:47.280]   it is not a natural look what the iphone's going to give you is the best most realistic
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.560]   photos they're supporting so by the way this is some video on the on the website there's no
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:58.320]   point in me streaming at 720p highly compressed go look at it at the website if you were able to
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:04.240]   if you have an apple tv 4k and you have a 4k tv i'm i would i'm gonna go home and watch the event
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.680]   on 4k because i think you'll see a lot that's better that's how i watched yeah because i was i was
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   working the living room i did not i did not anticipate it being as cinematic as it was and
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:20.880]   boy did the photo and did the photo and video demos really hit home on a 4k 60 inch h h h d r tv
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.080]   it's the first they say first camera ever to record in Dolby vision that's an hdr format
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:33.760]   but playback it supports all three hdr formats i don't i don't think any other phone does that
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:44.720]   the iphone 11 was 8 bit hdr this is 10 bit hdr Dolby vision is you know stunning
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:51.200]   the screen now they're even calling it an xdr screen to kind of emphasize that you're going to
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:58.800]   get the the brightness i the the nits were super high the resolution almost 500 pixels per inch
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.400]   and you're going to get the hdr so you're going to look at that screen and you're going to see
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.600]   what you shot and it's going to look fantastic i think this is an amazing
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:14.160]   uh uh camera i think apple apple is now making perhaps the best
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.360]   certainly the best phone camera out there and i suspect it's a camera that's going to compete
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:26.320]   even with dslrs they're offering something now called pro raw or will be which gives you all of
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:34.240]   the bits off the sensor that's the raw part but also saves the computational data the uh
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:41.040]   fusion engine all the apple apple image data yeah yeah my data which means and it with you know
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.480]   obviously you're gonna have to get an app that'll support this i'm sure apples will
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:49.440]   makes you wonder if they should have kept aperture around although they did point out that photoshop
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.120]   adobe photoshop will support it i imagine lightroom will support it that's lumenar you think lumenar
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:00.000]   i'll do it i hope so so i will do it those boys are super super quick and then on the iphone
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.560]   you can know right away that pro camera and i have to give a shout out to umiwi workshop who's
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:10.960]   in the chat he's their designer for that makes all the buttons look cute um that that pro camera
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   app is already one of the dopest apps for the iphone so be able to do photora with that app you're
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.840]   going to be basically like having a mirrorless camera and i can just say we have there is a kit
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:27.120]   there's an there we will expose all of the features of this camera so third-party camera apps can use
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:35.520]   it um boy i tell you this is gonna be they're clearly they've pinpointed that photosh they didn't
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.840]   even mention that you can make phone calls with this by the way they didn't they didn't show messages
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:47.120]   they didn't show anything else they didn't run apps they you know they spent a little time with
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.880]   gaming i think this was kind of their response to losing fortnight they said oh and now you
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:33:00.960]   could play league of legends it's like you play last year's game if you want and oh that was good
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:08.800]   that was nit picky yeah i don't know this i do have to say though that demonstration and all of
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:15.840]   this camera stuff is really uh flexing the apple silicon what they are really saying is you have a
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:24.960]   phone you have a six core four gpu phone in your pocket we can make we can put in that chip 11.8
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:31.680]   billion transistors yeah let's let's not forget that this is all part of clearing the clearing the
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:37.280]   the the the runway for the launch of the first apple silicon based mac they used to they used to
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:42.080]   maybe in a passing when they're talking about the cpu's that's what that's in the ipad and the ipad
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   launches and the and the iphone launches they would say oh and now we have the legendary the the
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.280]   revolutionary a 10 processor in which we've combined a b and c but ever since that they announced the
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.920]   shift to apple silicon every single one of these product announcements has said and here's how we've
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.040]   specifically tailored this custom designed apple silicon chip to the specific needs of this this
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:06.240]   platform yes because this is based to keep repeating repeating repeating those words so that people
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.760]   will hear oh wow apple silicon and a mac finally i've been hoping for this for 10 years whereas a
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.480]   you're good i thought oh so it doesn't run until and so it's not going to be compatible with any
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.000]   of the software but there are a lot of concerns when you say an arm processor oh it's going to be
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.560]   low power exactly right uh or you know low slow and obviously this is this is not the case
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.960]   they have so many transistors in this chip they have enough room to have a dedicated image
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:37.440]   processor in here dedicated machine learning in here um there is so much overhead and what they're
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.800]   doing it's just it's just kind of you know i don't i don't say anybody competes to be honest with you
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:49.520]   well it this is going to be the first real head-to-head of google's philosophy and making a camera
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   versus apple's philosophy and making a camera the previous like czar of google photography
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.800]   who just recently left the way yeah thank you very much and went to adobe gave a long interview
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:06.000]   after he uh he uh i think it within gadget i think i could be wrong but which he's talking
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.440]   about like well hey well but why does like why have you guys why is google use the same uh image
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.120]   image shift for the past two or three years uh image sensor for the past two or three years from
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.800]   sony and he said well look at some point the the pixels that we're getting are going to be as good
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.040]   or as good as they're going to get uh we not we're not going to make the mistakes of other
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.520]   bankers and we'll try to put try to make the pixels smaller because that will result in more
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.240]   data but more garbage data and the philosophy that we've always had that we've think that has paid
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.400]   off is we're going to make more better we're going to make better calculations based on getting
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.960]   great data from each pixel that we actually have and so it's not that because there have not been
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.000]   any real revolution or revolutions and sensors lately it's just not worth us putting our money
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.360]   in style of that and to be frank if when i go through my i i test lots of cameras i test lots of
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.760]   it tested every if iphone when i scroll back through at least instagram which i realize is not
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.440]   like the portfolio level uh image viewer it's very very it's at times it's very very hard for me to
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.800]   see the difference between something that i shot on my pixel version one which was my daily carry
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.800]   until like two or three months ago and a phone that was made this year and cost two or three times
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.160]   as much mostly because i think a lot of it is because this four or five four-year-old phone
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.680]   is running like uh 2020 versions of google's image processing software but the great thing but
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:32.480]   the thing that really got my interest because yeah i really am a uh my an enthusiastic amateur
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.320]   photographer let's say uh and uh the things that i was seeing in all these descriptions was really
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:42.320]   really good for one thing that hey look we've got a bigger image sensor not that hey we've got a
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.640]   40 megapixel image sensor but again we we have bigger same 12 megapixel but they're 1.7 microns
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:54.480]   now right they're so much better more light as you said doc rock f1.6 on the wide angle
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.560]   water aperture 65 millimeter on the tele 65 on a phone and that's well so it's interesting because
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:11.520]   that's a 52 millimeter lens but they have 2.5x optical zoom on the lens they also have optical
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:17.760]   image stabilization i mean this is something sony became famous for this is built into the camera
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.400]   and by the way the features are now part of the selfie cam so in the past you've given up a lot
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.800]   of night side and everything yeah you've given up a lot of stuff to get that selfie not anymore
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:34.720]   you got deep fusion you got smart htr you got night mode you got Dolby vision recording
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:42.960]   on the selfie cam but i don't want to leave you out rosemary because uh we we've got these two
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.480]   camera guys over here get all excited three maybe if you would me do you use do you take pictures
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:55.760]   oh you're muted poor rosemary she got so bored with this she went off got a cup of coffee
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.440]   go ahead tea tea or maybe we're talking over so much that we actually psychically turned off her
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.320]   microphone from remote from from where we were we're sorry we've lost you rose no i sneezed and i
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.280]   stood on my cough switch to sneeze um so i wouldn't deafen you and then forgot um
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.040]   so i take a lot of photos actually uh especially in the last couple of weeks my dad's been redecorating
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.040]   my place so i've taken loads of photos of all the work that he's done so i could show my grandparents
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.800]   and everything you know like what we've been up to um and i don't really know a lot about photography
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.760]   i did have a digital SLR at one point and learned how to use it and that was fun but lurking that
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.560]   around it was too much work and i think that you're the person they're aiming at somebody who says
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.720]   i'm not a camera buff but look at these pictures you know that's a thing like i know enough about
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.240]   the camera stats to look at it and go that's good especially a telephoto lens like i i actively try
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.360]   to avoid zooming on digital photos because you are just copying the pictures yeah yeah it's terrible
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.600]   and so i i much prefer like you know i got i got the pro because i wanted that telephoto lens again
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.240]   um i wasn't willing to give that up for the ultra wide i find that i do use the ultra wide more than
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.760]   i was thinking but i use telephoto more than i use ultra wide so i am going to be getting pro again
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.080]   purely for that just and i'm going for the max because it does have a better camera it also has
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.600]   better battery life and a couple of other things that i wanted um but you know it it it you know it
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.400]   has that camera and that's the selling point for a lot of people um you know they walk into a store
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.040]   looking to get a phone and somebody shows them the amazing photos that you can take and they'll buy it
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.600]   just to be clear the pro max and pro have the same camera features right
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:42.720]   yes yes and no oh the max has more yes so for instance the the pro's uh focal length is 52
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:52.160]   vice 65 and then there's 1.4 microns versus 1.7 microns oh so i i want that bigger sensor is what i
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:57.440]   want right so the ultra wide is stuff is the same but other than not that's where you're going to get
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:03.920]   your changes is going to be you know the the ultra i mean sorry the telephoto lens and then of course
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:10.640]   the uh pixel size but to your point Leo what you said about rosemary's case is 100% true
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.520]   it's the people that i don't need to know about camera because the camera doesn't for you and
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:20.640]   that's always been happens maneuver right i'm going to just these are the dope pictures you're
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:27.360]   looking for i was can i can i shout out maybe again i benefited from having
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.200]   watched it live on a on a 4k HDR display uh that i was one of the demo pictures that really blew me
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:40.000]   away was they had a they had a portrait of a person with very very dark skin number one number two
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.880]   oh it wasn't very very very very high very very high contrast too so yeah so the camera side
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:53.360]   side of their face was in shadow and yet it was pulling lots of detail from that shadow and this is
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.800]   this was i don't know if this was a specific flex because it's a known fact that the because
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:05.600]   the engineers behind image sensors have historically been white people it's optimized to make sure
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.080]   that takes really good pictures of white people and when you try to take pictures of people of color
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.480]   the results can be very very variable so i i'm sure that wasn't a flex because they
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.760]   they were they were very very happy to have portraits of a very white diversity of people
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.960]   around there but i thought that was a very very well chosen image i did i did want to say but i did
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.120]   when we're talking about the image stabilization one thing they mentioned that absolutely caught
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.000]   my full attention is that this is not the first uh iPhone by a long shot that has optical image
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.800]   stabilization but they've switched to a censorship right so they're actually so and what so basically
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.400]   the actual silicon sensor moves around and they said was 5000 micro adjustments per second
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.560]   being able to give you a two second stabilized hand tail that's all great but i couldn't help
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:57.840]   but remember by the camera that i bought five years ago the Olympus OM-D EM-1 which i still love i use
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.600]   use every single day or every single week it had it also had being being a professional camera it
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:10.240]   also had censorship censorship five-axis stabilization and a year later i it they
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:17.760]   Olympus gave me a free firmware update that would let me take let the 16 megapixel sensor
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:23.520]   take 40 to 50 megapixel landscape pictures because and this is technique has been used on a lot of
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.600]   different cameras where engineers to figure it out the wait a minute if we have the ability to make
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:36.400]   micro to move this image sensor in micro little adjustments uh on our whim that means that
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:42.480]   we could take the original 12 megapixel picture if it's locked down in a tripod then shift that
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:48.080]   sensor over just a bit so we can capture some of the information that was between those two pixels
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.720]   and then shift it up a little bit and capture some more information that was between all the pixels
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.640]   that we took before and it's not even necessarily pixel bending which is the way of cheating uh
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.240]   of cheating a good picture out of a high high resolution bad one but you're actually able to pull
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:10.640]   a serious additional detail and realistically functional 20 to 30 megapixel images from a really
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.240]   small sensor now apple didn't even hint at this let alone announce it but i couldn't help but think
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:24.480]   that if i were if i were a camera engineer working for apple and i had like my i'm a senior camera
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:31.120]   camera engineer at apple of addition of the iphone 12 pro and so i could do whatever is with this
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:38.080]   i want in my off time i would be building a 50 megapixel landscape photography app for this thing
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.640]   and then we would see if we could actually there was we could actually put it into a shipping product
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   but it just i'm i'm excited about it because i've just this is this is the day we're only two hours
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:53.200]   or so outside of the announcement so your my mind at least is full of well geez this could mean
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.080]   this and wow the potential for this is here but it's part of what gets me so excited about this
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   camera i mean i'm not i i actually own uh a decent decent enough actually this is the 350 dollar
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.280]   pixel phone so this is not by a top drawer of anything by any means but a few years ago i bought
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:18.800]   a 500 dollar like panasonic lumics very nice uh sony image sensor uh pocket cameras so that i could
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.360]   still have a camera in my pocket that would take better pictures than even a five or six or eight
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:29.040]   hundred dollar phone i found myself thinking that if i were going into uh the at and t store the
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.240]   vryza store with seven hundred dollars in my pocket to buy the new iphone 12 because they said that
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.040]   oh i really just want the iphone 12 uh and they and i worked to look at this and they were and they
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:43.600]   were able to convince me of how much better pictures i could take with the pro model for three hundred
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.000]   dollars more i could easily talk myself into saying well you know what for the past year you've
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.920]   been thinking maybe i should buy one of those six hundred dollars sony uh pocket pocket
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.480]   pocket cameras for when i'm traveling but i don't want to take my real camera with me or every time
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:03.200]   i've been disappointed by the the pictures that uh that uh my my phone camera said this would be like
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.680]   getting a camera that for my purposes would be almost as good as that for three hundred dollars
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.960]   and without having to carry an extra charger and extra device so i i can't wait for people who are
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.960]   actual professionals and actual uh their reviews include histograms and scatter charts and lots of
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:22.400]   things that they have to have the circles and arrows on the back and the paragraph on the back
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.200]   of each one explaining what it is i can't wait for the independent testers to see if any of this
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.560]   really really works because i got the we get we get the whole spier every single year about how much
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.960]   better this year's iphone camera is than last year's this was the first time that i think they
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:43.280]   hit enough bullet points that would catch the attention of any everybody who knows how good
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:50.000]   pictures result from good hardware said that is bung bung bung boom boom and suddenly the person
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.520]   who bought a three hundred fifty dollar android phone intending it to use a phoenix two or three
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:46:00.080]   years is like i said at the at the outset you know as a journalist it would be irresponsible for me to
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:05.120]   i borrow a phone from apple and only have it for three months and not being able to give it the
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.720]   rigorous day-to-day year-to-year testing that weasel in your shoulder that says
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.000]   cost a thousand dollars well i have a thousand dollars i'm gonna make another thousand dollars
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.200]   like not not that exactly it's like i'll i'll be under i'll be under contrast slap the cuffs on
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.360]   the atnt i'll be under contract for the two years if i can have this phone and tell myself i'm only
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.000]   spending ten dollars a month for eighteen years rosemary you actually made a really good point i didn't
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.040]   realize this i was thinking oh i'll just get the i found twelve pro now because i can get it now
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:43.280]   it sounds like uh it's worth waiting uh yeah for me for me i want the max anyway so waiting to make
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:49.200]   sure that i i get the the max with the better camera is you know cherry on top of the cake um
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.800]   and the fact that there's another payday between now and then that doesn't hurt you can see it well
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:00.800]   okay so what color are you going to get there they're more colors for the mini and the 12
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:07.760]   you've got red white blue uh and product a red white blue you've got this green
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:14.800]   and you've got this black uh but what color but but when it comes to the the max you're gonna
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:20.800]   have fewer choices right i'm wavering between blue and silver the blue is currently got gold i like
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.960]   the gold um but i am also trying to keep in mind the fact that my dad does not like gold and it's
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.120]   entirely possible but next year he'll be there going so what am i getting your iphone when i'm
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:37.520]   he's the hammy okay yeah well this year my mom's the hammy down person uh and she she's very happy
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.160]   with gold and that's all good but i'm just thinking you know i can't do it to dad huh silver or blue
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.320]   is probably you know something that he'll be okay with somebody i think you might think the girl
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.400]   gold is a bit girly for him that's even though it's not it's a very nice color Matthew pans are you
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:57.120]   know twitter said the girl is the cartel edition bobby cruz according to bobby cruz you must get
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:03.040]   pacific blue really i do love the blue it's so pretty you don't you know wait lee are you you
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.480]   you have to remember that show remember mario lopez he was riding the bike around as a police
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:15.040]   his name was bobby cruz bobby cruz baby yeah i guess i have all i have all sisters so i had to watch that
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.640]   i'm so excited i'm afraid i don't remember that that's one thing that's one thing we didn't touch
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.720]   upon but something that i i put into my notes because i was so excited about it that finally
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:31.680]   for phones we're being given options other than and now available in silver gray and a slightly
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.800]   darker shade of gray so no no now you can get like actual colors particularly for getting like the
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:42.560]   less expensive ones i think that reflects back on my uh on my observation that i think apple is a
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.600]   little bit insulted that you would cover up uh their beautiful design phone with a case i think
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.040]   maybe that's part of the reason why they're also said oh we're not even gonna talk about gorilla
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.960]   glass because we have something better than a gorilla it's i think it's gorilla glass right i
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:01.120]   think this ceramic is is that well it's ceramic same there there's some this ceramic thing is kind
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.000]   of a big deal a lot of the third party glass shields have been ceramic i need everyone i need
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.760]   everyone of a drinking a's to go grab a shot glass real quick because we have got to give a toast
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:18.800]   to 128 at the start okay i was getting really irritated with giving us really powerful phones
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:25.120]   with wimpy memory now let's again my favorite hashtag don't get it twisted 128 on the iPhone
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:31.520]   pro max is still silly because that's about eight pictures but it's a start you know well you
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:38.480]   it is a start they they use to sell 16 gig and 32 gig iPhones it's crazy so 128 it's a little
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.080]   more sensible i agree 128 is sensible and if you paired that with the two terabyte iCloud storage
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:50.160]   and you got your photo thing situated in hic okay i'll i'll accept so what are you gonna get
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.880]   with the actress what are you buying what are you gonna get 12 i wish they had a one terabyte
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:03.760]   512 what i had this is 512 right now and it's uh is it full 60 68 70 full at the moment
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:10.720]   and then but i do a lot of video with it so that that does get full and i do remove it but with
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.920]   filming pro and the things that you can pull off with filming pro and filming pro remote and things
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.880]   that you can pull off with the DJI you know um direct through here through the osmo pocket and
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:27.760]   that i actually use my memory for what it's there for so again this is amazing this is quite amazing
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:33.120]   what they're coming through and you have to know that if you're shooting hdr and you're shooting
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:39.200]   10 big video do not sell yourself short remember you will be kicking and screaming if you have to
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:46.320]   wait a week or sell something from your star wars collection to make sure you get enough rap make
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:52.720]   sure you get enough storage because that video will eat your phone but show rosemary look how pretty
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.000]   the gold is though don't you want i know it's so nice but at the same time i've got gold right now
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.880]   and i'm fine with it it's nice but it's not keen on the super shiny gold edges like the ones on
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:08.560]   my iphone right here a little bit you know more rose gold than gold yeah yeah blur effect and
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.280]   skype is not doing us favors here but you know people know that take 200 grit sandpaper to the
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.680]   edge when you get it oh is that tall it down a little bit is that your is that your technique
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:23.680]   no i'm not doing that oh he's just he's just bitter don't listen to him i want everything
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:30.720]   matt finished i don't care what it is i i i think it's like the matt finish just because those glints
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:36.240]   will bother you and if you're using studio lights the glints off of that will kind of drive you
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:41.040]   crazy but hopefully you know through casing or bump ridges and things like that we can get rid
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:46.000]   of that again i do love the four shape coming back at first i didn't think i would care you know i
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.600]   got a poll earlier this week and i said no love the curve but i do remember the ability to stand up
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.880]   when you're trying to do something you know just rest on his edge i think it's an antenna thing i'm
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.560]   gonna guess it has to do with the fight i think yeah i think you're right i think it's definitely an
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.800]   antenna thing this is the first time since antenna gate that apple during a major keynote event
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.240]   spoke about the where the antennas and where they were i think i think that a small factor also might
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:15.360]   have been given that there are people who you can you can spend as much money as you spent on that phone
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:21.520]   on on on a on a camera operator frame on a grid for mounting other things to it the fact that if i
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:26.720]   bet they got a lot of feedback from their pro users that damn it it's the it's these curved edges that
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:32.400]   make it really really hard to build the accessories we want to build for it if it were just flat edges
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:36.880]   we could just sort of like install it like a cartridge into this wonderful hand grip lighting
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:44.080]   and sound system so i bet there's a lot of people talking i tell you 512 gigs gonna set you back 1400
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:51.120]   smacaroos shiggle it's okay it's worth every second of it and and and and he's right about
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:59.360]   adapting the slightly curved edges for things like the ulanzi grip you know which is really great for
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:04.880]   the phone in the pocket at the same time or things like the lonzi regular handheld grip where you go
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:12.800]   like that the curve doesn't allow it to bite as well for security purposes in that you know sort of
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:19.920]   bracket so absolutely the straight edges or straightest edges will make gripage much better
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.960]   small rig and these other guys i agree i agree oh just fantastic connections yeah yeah
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:31.840]   rosemary you're gonna get the blue i think i might yeah i'm liking the blue it's pretty
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:38.800]   um it's it's not girly or particularly masculine it's just a nice color i was not particularly keen on
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:45.040]   the forest green i have to say it felt a little bit opinionated whereas the the blue feels like it's
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:50.640]   neither it's it's not gender towards anyone where or anything like that which is good i should say
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:57.360]   you know unappinionated blue that's good as i my system out here i'll take pacific blue because
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:04.640]   okay i am specifically in the pacific pacific blue is in fact the name of that tv show so
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:09.360]   what let's call it that from no one and Andy are we gonna talk you into giving an iPhone this year
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.640]   yes it's it's not impossible i really thought this would be a good year to sit things out
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.880]   whether you're an i thought it's the goodbye phone or i thought so too i i thought oh there's nothing
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:25.280]   they can do this gonna make me get a new i thought well not necessarily like there's nothing they
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.800]   could do but on on the android side of things uh okay for me it would have been pixel because i
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.840]   on on the google side of things i the one feature that i kind of want more than anything else five
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:41.120]   exactly i want their camera technology that's google only i want the updates their timely
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:46.240]   this their google google only and this is definitely a rebuilding year per pixel you don't want to touch
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.320]   it uh with this is a fantastic phone the reason why before seeing it and anticipating that was
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.120]   going to be an okay upgrade i thought that i don't want it the first generation 5g anything
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:02.720]   because i want the next gen i want the next year version of it that has a reaction to well now we
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.720]   have 10 million iPhone users in the united states of america using and using this 5g phone now we
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:14.080]   know exactly where things screwed up remember all those articles and 9 to 5 mac and 9 to 5 mac in
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:22.560]   december of 2020 we don't want our our 2021 users to have that but i have to say that i i'm i'm really
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:29.040]   again that weasel that's saying okay now it's now it's $1,100 but again you have 11 let me let's pull
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:35.920]   up the bank statement you have more than $1,100 Andy and and so it's making me think that i'll
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.000]   probably talk myself out of that but it's also making me think well next year there's going to be an
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.440]   iPhone 13 which means that a lot of people are going to be sick and tired of their crummy crappy
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:50.480]   horrible old iPhone 12 pro max and maybe they'll sell it for five or six hundred dollars and then
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.840]   you'll have that wonderful pocket camera incredibly flat wonderful pocket camera that you've kind of
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.880]   wanted that will work better than the $500 pocket camera for bantasonic that you bought three or
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:07.600]   four years ago but rarely used because it records it charges via micro micro usb and you can't
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:14.720]   post directly to google photos and instagram from it and it's really they've for someone like me and
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.880]   i'm i'm a freak i'm a mutant again i'm i'm inside wearing a scarf and it's not really that cold inside
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:26.400]   here uh this is a really compelling it gives the weasel a lot to whisper in my ear i'll tell you that
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:36.160]   all right rosemary orchard doc rock and deonaco i think we've we've gone on long enough about this
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:41.520]   there's probably a lot more to say but we've got many more mac break weeklies to come let's uh
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:46.640]   we did miss one thing Leo what's that they did sneak in a pair of beats beats flex
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:52.160]   it goes on sale in like a week or so it's only 50 bucks though which is actually pretty decent
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.720]   for beats and i think it's because you know a lot of people have to do the zooms and they're running
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.160]   around and so they're they're they're not as pretentious whatever beats but yeah if you go into the
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:09.440]   iphone click on accessories the beat flex all day and the japanese uh in me says that they come in
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:14.560]   yuzu yellow which is incredible because but my series speaks to me in japanese and i love the
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.160]   freak people out with that you know those are ugly cheese louise really the
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.480]   flame blue flame blue it got really well with specific blue oh yeah but it will do you like blue
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:29.280]   blue like losing things you know it's funny these look so much like the bluetooth
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.600]   headphones i wear they were sport model i can't remember who made them but they were great
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:39.360]   i like it when they're attached because it makes it hard to lose one i i have i have lost i have
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:44.320]   i've lost the left earbud from the wonderful ninety nine dollar refurbished two hundred fifty
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:49.840]   dollars sony noise cancelling because it was like the third or fourth time i had to take off a mask
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.000]   it went flying i was in the middle of something so i couldn't like take the thing out of my pocket
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.920]   pick it up and put it the things i put in a pocket or put on a shelf somewhere i'm hoping it's somewhere
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:03.040]   in the house and didn't go to the laundry service but this is why i've actually dug out some of the
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:08.000]   that those beat style like corded bluetooth headphones because when you unplug when you have your
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.680]   earphones because you're you're at the counter at the supermarket you want to talk to somebody
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.200]   you can let it drop and it won't fall to the floor so they do include the w1 chips so that's good
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:21.600]   so they they snuck this out they didn't mention it i mean less i nope they didn't mention it right
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:26.320]   they just kind of snuck it snuck it out the beats flex all right we are going to do our picks
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:31.520]   of the week next did they warn you rosemary orchard that we're going to do picks of the week
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:37.440]   uh no but that's okay would you like to do a pick you don't have to i'll go at the end but i
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:44.160]   think i have a pick okay okay doc rock did they warn you we're going to do picks i've been watching
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:50.560]   you since so you knew you were cute so yeah since i was cute i don't think that was ever possible
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:56.480]   all right what is your three minutes three minutes ago mr mr the port box yes that's right
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.680]   well it was your god even cuter since then
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:10.240]   what's your pick of the week doc rock um you know this is funny and again um i i have to pick this
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:17.680]   because it's something that we've all been waiting for and it's it took the boys a while and i'm so
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:22.960]   glad that they were finally able to bring it to fruition but the guys over at e-cam again they
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:28.720]   make the streaming software use e-cam live they just introduced interview mode and so what that
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:34.800]   allows you to do is rather than sending someone a Skype you know link or whatever you can send a
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:41.440]   neophyte a link to a web browser and a web browser works with your phone your ipad magpc whatever
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:46.800]   any modern browser and you allow that person to become a guest on your show so if you look at any
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:53.840]   other streams i did say like in the last two weeks or so i'm able to have my either viewers or
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:59.280]   people that just need sort of instant help they can just press that link they can pop on the screen
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:04.080]   and we can discuss whatever issues they're having or help solve them or choose a piece of gear or
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:09.120]   just their lighting their microphones whatever you know the type of stuff that i do and i think
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:14.320]   the key of it is this the type of link that i can send to my older sister and she would just
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:19.200]   click in and be right there i don't have to explain her anything other than remind her to wear headphones
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:25.120]   because for some reason people still love to have the compare about that i know i know i'm like at
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:31.200]   what point from way back in radio in the 70s used to call the radio station the guy will always
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:39.200]   take your phone off speaker yes i still say that doc yeah like so i still have to say that doc other
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:44.080]   than having to remind people to wear headphones although they built an echo cancellation as well
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:53.040]   it's it's absolutely amazing and i think even if you only you know not even sure if you want to do
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.800]   streaming whatever you should take a look at the software because it is very simple again
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:01.200]   you can run it off of iPhones you can run it off of mirrorless cameras with cam links
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:09.280]   mini cameras connect just by usb so if you have usb like say a cannon where they have that
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:15.040]   um webcam utility you can just literally plug your cable in with the usb and you're off and running
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.560]   so my last feature of this which is one of my favorites if you're stuck doing zoom meetings
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.920]   but you don't like the look up the nose look of your camera on your notebook you can take the
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.920]   camera that you normally use for vacation plug that in and use virtual cam to bring it in so right
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:38.160]   now my Skype is actually using virtual camera from e-cam so that you guys allow me to run a flat
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:45.840]   gamma log profile with the LUT to make my old look you that's what we're doing wow yeah here i can
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:49.760]   do you real quickly that's really sweet slide my LUT up and down oh look at that
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:57.840]   that i am changing my LUT on the fly adjust my camera because again skype's camera implementation
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:04.960]   is a little fugly yeah you know for lack of a better word so yeah um i might have to buy this i
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:09.360]   might have to you know mica mica uses it for all of his shows we gotta i gotta
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:15.120]   oh really i can i can send you um the is it e-cam live which which
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:24.880]   yeah let my my link is darkrock.live/ecamp okay and then that will get you like you know well on
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:30.880]   your way you can download the trial and then Leo yeah back channel me and i'll talk to the devs and
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.800]   see if they can you know send you something to play with um but yes it is literally hands down my
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:45.280]   favorite and you know it's so easy to use overlays all that stuff like i did wirecast and OBS for
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.800]   years and you know i'm not Leo i can't afford a lovely studio we love our tricaster we wouldn't
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.880]   replace it but you know what no mica's at home uh doing all our shows and he uses e-cam it's
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.680]   it really works well for him when you are on the road and by the way if you jump in the community
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:07.920]   in order to test our interview mode it is in beta right now but i'm the beta moderator so
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:13.360]   send a link you know request to jump in the beta group i'll add you right away and then you can play
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.160]   like it's absolutely gorgeous and you'll have fun yeah and i can help you if you get stuck
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:23.360]   Anthony Nielsen says he uses it he's t-deed some of our after hours instead of having to come in
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:29.760]   here he's done it from his house using e-cam live um does aunt he uses e-cam too does he i know
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:34.880]   he's a pc guy see there's no windows version for this this is one thing that you're glad you're
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:42.400]   on the Mac i don't i being who they are and being where they come from a skype call recorder and i
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:48.400]   glasses remember i glasses when we first got cameras on max yeah i mean these these guys been here
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.720]   since they left avid and started their own company oh they're all other ex-avitors uh that
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:58.160]   extra yeah yeah and pro tools okay but yeah i dropped the link in the chat and if you want to
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.600]   check it out again docrock.live/ecamp and just you know come to my show if you have questions i'll
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:09.360]   get you started nice thank you docrock always a pleasure having you on i appreciate and the
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.720]   in our co-pick of the week um this is not my pick of the week but i wanted to set you up with a
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.480]   trap question i bet you think that these are post-it notes they are not what these are i thought
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:25.920]   they were craft vivita slices but okay actually they forgot about it but it's not as much nutritional
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:32.000]   value they melt just about as easily uh but yes these are pixels i've i decided i got i got the
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.320]   idea last week because i've got i live in what would be the equivalent of timesquare of a quaint
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:44.880]   new england kind of touristy seaside three hundred year old village and i don't do window decorations
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:49.680]   very much i've done in a couple years but i realized oh you know it'd be really fun let's do like post
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:55.600]   it note art like in the in the windows pixel art yeah and so exactly and so what i needed i needed
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:02.960]   to go get a pixel art app for for the mac and i found a really really great one called pixen pixen
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:10.160]   uh and boy oh boy not only is it good for if you want to do pixel art and really pixel art is a lot
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:14.400]   like it reminded me of how much i enjoyed using mac paint back in the day because it really is like
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:20.800]   either a haiku or trying to write something in twitter where i want i want a pumpkin in the window
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:26.800]   but i can't draw a circle because i don't i i figured out that measured it out and my windows are uh
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:32.720]   like 12 by 12 pixels of these pixels wide so i'm limited also limited to the colors that i can
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:38.640]   get post it notes in and so but it's like okay breathe in blue breathe out green we're going to be
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:45.280]   a piece and oneness and we're going to click on the minimum number of dots necessary to convey
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:50.720]   the jack o'lanterness of this design and even if i weren't doing this as window art it's like wow
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:56.640]   that's i'm pretty i'm very happy with that in in a 12 by 12 grid with only like three colors i made
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:01.760]   a pretty darn nice jack o'lantern and now i can move on to the ghost and i'm gonna go for a
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:06.560]   witch if i can but we're gonna see how well it works and instagram post as soon as you've completed
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:11.680]   this there will there will be a post of some kind about this but i'll even if you're not interested
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.160]   in this i i really think that anybody who's interested in really great app design should check
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:22.400]   this check this app out because it's available on the app store you can also go to pixinapp.com if you
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:26.880]   agree with the 500 page government report that we'll probably talk about next week that apple
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:31.440]   abuses its abuses developers through the app store and you would rather let them have the
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:38.960]   $10 directly through an app a direct download but the it is exactly the way that i would want
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:45.200]   a pixel editing app to work every time it was an app i've never used before but as soon as i
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:51.680]   started using it everything that i expected it to do it did and almost every time i guessed at
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.480]   how i could make a certain thing happen that was exactly the way to do it and there are layers so
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:00.080]   i could have like i could start off by getting the shape of the pumpkin and then
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:04.640]   click click around with a black post it notes to figure out how to make this face in these
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:08.640]   thoughts so i could do multiple layers it does do animation if you want to do animation but it has
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:13.280]   this i also has this really really cool trick and i don't know if i have enough usb cord yes i
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:19.520]   believe in wired cords for my mouse but i i do have like a wired mouse uh i do because i kind of like
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.600]   when i met productivity and i like to have two buttons and the designer of this app did something
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:30.160]   super super clever that is perfect for the app that that they were designing so that if you
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:34.400]   to the left of like the art creation window i think i gave you a link on like there you go on
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.840]   on google photos so that that is my pumpkin prototype or pumpkin mark one prototype i might
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:45.760]   change the the faces but so i didn't i didn't include a picture of the of the tool palette but
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.560]   you will see what looks like a very very familiar color version of mac paint to pal
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:54.000]   tool palette but there are two of them stacked one on top of the other because
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:01.520]   you can have one tool assigned to the left mouse button and a different tool assigned to the right
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:05.760]   mouse button because there's a lot of trial and error in trying to design something a pixel art
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:10.960]   so you can place it place a pixel down and they say no i don't want that there and just click on
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.880]   the right button if you set that as the eraser and suddenly it's the eraser i found myself setting
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:21.680]   it up them both up as pencil tools but the left button was for drawing orange pixels the right
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:29.360]   button was for drawing black pixels and it will i got that really wow i got i know it's like
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:36.400]   it's like and it looks and oh my god it's a species you know you know if you by the way it's also available
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:43.120]   for iowa so you know that some i interface designer uh at at apple is like throwing up
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.680]   because like there must be some way we can remove those from the app store and you can't have two
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:54.320]   pallets assigned to two different mouse buttons the left the right button must be for contextual
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:00.000]   menus all right okay and to me i want to be any five minutes on a pixel editor but we got it
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.240]   it is it is it is good i get it it's good it's as good as it can get
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:15.040]   the name of it is again pixin pixen app.com rosemary we didn't forget you you now have to do it

[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.720]   yeah i've got custom icons and everything so i've got icons for different podcasts i do icons for
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.920]   screencast online where i make shows and stuff like that and it opens folders and then i have links to
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:35.680]   all the different actual things that i access like web pages folders and finder it's it's great
