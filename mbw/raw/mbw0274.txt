[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.180]   And today we've got a boy, a really great bunch of people.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.980]   I have to say that Alex Lindsey is in Chicago
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.500]   and does not have sufficient internet connection
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.220]   to join us today.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.940]   But don't worry, we've got the great Jason Snell
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.940]   in house with us.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.340]   Jason, the editor-in-chief of Macworld Magazine.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.940]   You can follow him on Twitter at jsnell.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.860]   And always welcome commentators.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.980]   Thank you for coming up.
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.260]   I guess you've been here far away.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.980]   I didn't realize that.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.140]   Yeah, and just down the road.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.380]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.260]   Also Andy Naco is here via Skype with his stacked cauldrons.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.540]   You're putting together--
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.620]   They're crucibles, sir, crucibles.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.620]   I get it.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.140]   In honor of National Novel Writing Month,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.380]   I decided to do tribute to an authormular play.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.700]   Wow.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.740]   It's because A-Sig, the world's zags.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.580]   So Andy Zag and Naco.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.380]   Thank you for being here joining us today.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.780]   Just a word of warning, it didn't happen during iPad today,
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.900]   which we recorded earlier.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.660]   But as you probably saw over Jason's shoulder,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.500]   the ditch which is out front.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.540]   And they may be digging at any moment.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.540]   So if you hear some Jack hammering,
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.820]   it is not me pounding my head against the table.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.820]   It is, in fact, a Jackhammer.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.020]   They're putting in fiber, actually, for us.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.460]   Yeah, there's a huge trench out there
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.860]   in a big machine with giant sucking systems.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.020]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   It's not--
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.220]   Can we put outside the studio for exchange?
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.580]   We had no fiber into the studio.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.300]   We had copper.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.020]   But we have a lot of bandwidth through the copper,
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.980]   because this phone company is just two blocks away.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.060]   So we're getting 35 megabits from our provider, SonicNet.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.900]   And they're really great.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   They do a great job.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.220]   But that's kind of the max copper can carry in this environment.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.660]   So we are ordering 100 megabit fiber symmetric.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.620]   So we'll have 135 megabits in here, which we don't--
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.260]   it's funny.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.820]   People say, oh, well, that's because you're streaming.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.300]   But we don't stream directly from here.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.900]   We send a single stream to our partners, Justin TV,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.620]   BitGravity, Ustream.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.900]   And of course, to cash fly in AOL,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.820]   so that they can then rebroadcast.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.940]   We couldn't feed all the thousands of people watching.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.260]   But it's usually about 5,000 people watch Macbreak Weekly.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.100]   That would be just out of control.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.460]   So we need that much just to upload to finals, believe it or not.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.700]   So I wanted to start off with something
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.500]   that may not be in the show rundown today.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.140]   Impromptu.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.780]   I'm going to go off the script a little bit,
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.940]   because I've been noticing--
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.980]   I noticed Dave Weiner's post yesterday, John Goober's
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.460]   before that.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.940]   And of course, John Syracuse, I think,
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.860]   who started all this with a podcast review of Isaac
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.700]   Sin's biography of Steve Jobs.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.260]   All three agree, it's terrible, which surprised me,
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.780]   because I really thought it was pretty good.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.620]   First of all, I'm not clear what their complaint is.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.940]   Dave doesn't say exactly.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.740]   He just says it's fairy tale time.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.460]   It's not what really happened.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.740]   And the fault lies with--
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.220]   he says with the author Walter Isaac Sin,
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.300]   because he wasn't technical enough
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.820]   to hit the technical high notes.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.660]   He basically says why Jobs chose Isaac Sin.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.820]   He chose him, because he was afraid a smart tech reporter
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   would call him on his BS.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.780]   See, now, Goober suggested that too.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.300]   And I think John Syracuse on his latest podcast
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.740]   said that he's not sure he believes that conspiracy theory.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.340]   I don't either.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.940]   There's actually some stuff in the book
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.860]   that explains why Isaac Sin feels that Jobs chose him.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.940]   If you look carefully, what you'll see
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.220]   is that Steve Jobs was really comfortable around people
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.820]   about his age, which is not unsurprising.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.020]   People who lived through the '60s in the early '70s
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   and sort of were formed by those experiences.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.940]   And I think he picked Isaac Sin, because Isaac Sin
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.180]   was one of the few people who were writers who had,
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.980]   in this case, written biographies before.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.180]   Einstein of Ben Franklin.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.820]   Right, right.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.180]   And he was about the same age, and they had had some dealings,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.700]   and he felt like that was a guy.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.500]   He wasn't going to go out to somebody he hadn't met,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   or somebody who was 20 years younger,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.220]   because he felt like that person--
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.180]   I really believe that this was not a calculation,
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.060]   and I'm going to pick somebody who doesn't understand
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.180]   the technology.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.660]   [LAUGHS]
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.540]   No, I think Isaac Sin, in fact, on the surface of it,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.460]   was a great choice.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.060]   He was head of the Aspen Institute, former time editor.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.420]   I mean, this guy had the chops.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.260]   He had written some very successful,
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.820]   highly regarded biographies of great men.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.100]   I mean, this isn't going to--
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.460]   and Jobs, apparently-- and I believe this gave him free range.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.660]   Didn't ask for approval.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.140]   Didn't even read the book before he passed away.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.740]   It wasn't necessarily a flattering biography by any means.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.700]   So what did he miss?
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.180]   Do you agree, Andy, that this is not a good biography?
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.300]   I think it's a good biography, given
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.780]   that it was published in the last year of this man's life.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.780]   I think that great biographies, it takes two, five, 10, 20 years
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.020]   to really not only see that life in context,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.220]   but also for people who are telling these stories
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.380]   to have additional perspective on that time
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.660]   and on the dealings they had with them.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.180]   I agree that there were a number of times
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.100]   when I'm reading a passage of an event in the book,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.540]   and I happen to know somebody who was at that meeting
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.780]   or in that room, and they told me a very different version
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.460]   of that.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.900]   But I don't think it was a--
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.860]   I don't think it was flawed at all.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.300]   I do agree with the point that it's not the most technical
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.820]   understanding possible.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.100]   I also agree that Dave Weiner and a couple other commenters,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.300]   especially people who cover journalism beats,
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.220]   specifically, were concerned that there
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.660]   were passages in which ISIS is saying,
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.060]   I was told about these future plans that Apple was working on
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.780]   and this other device that they're working on,
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.620]   but I'm not going to tell you about it because I think
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.380]   that that's a trade secret and Apple should have the right
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.820]   to develop this thing.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.300]   Dave Weiner in his piece was a--
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.820]   zeroed in on this as well, saying, well, look,
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.740]   that proves that he's sort of the lap dog of Apple,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.380]   that if you're a journalist, you simply
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.220]   write about the entire story.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.540]   I think it would-- I think that that would have--
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.740]   talking about the stuff that he was told about Apple's future
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.500]   plans, about things that are in the pipeline that Apple wants
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.900]   to pursue, would have added a little bit of extra color.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.300]   I respect the choice that he made.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.140]   I too sometimes learn things that are not--
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.420]   are interesting but not necessarily part of the story
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.300]   that I want to tell or that I think is important,
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.660]   but I think would have been interesting
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.860]   to have that extra-- those extra shades of color.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.900]   Weiner says, it's like writing a romance
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.500]   without ever having experienced love,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.660]   that Isaacson couldn't understand how it worked
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.980]   because of his lack of technology,
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:58.060]   but also couldn't understand the relationships that Jobs had.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.340]   And he also says, I don't support the author's belief
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.540]   that Jobs' life was strictly a net plus for the human race.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.740]   And I think this is really what maybe we're really hearing
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.940]   is that it was hard to believe, too kind.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.660]   Look, everybody wants something to get something different
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.060]   out of this Steve Jobs book.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.740]   And I think the reality is there will be many Steve Jobs
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.100]   books.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.940]   I think there's going to be a definitive biography
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.660]   of the man in the future, and this
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.900]   will be a great source for that.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.380]   I don't think this is that book.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.580]   I think one of the conflicts I see in people,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.900]   but I also see in the book, is this a biography of the man
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.380]   or of Apple?
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.900]   And it's torn, especially in the last 10 years,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.940]   where he's got access that is an end very many other books.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.060]   You start to see the book veer off onto talking about,
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.140]   here's the decision-making process at Apple about this thing,
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.940]   which is interesting, but I feel like there's probably
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.420]   a whole book about the second reign of Jobs at Apple
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.020]   and the decisions they made.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.220]   That's not the same book as Jobs the Man.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.780]   So I think we're kind of conflating a lot of different desires
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.140]   into this one book, and no book was going to succeed.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.740]   But what's great about this book is because of the access,
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.580]   there are tidbits.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.020]   There are insights.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.020]   And he doesn't sum it up, and he doesn't say, well,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.060]   let me explain to you everything about who he was.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.860]   But I got-- I formed some opinions.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.620]   I did, too.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.620]   And I feel like in five or 10 or 15 years,
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.660]   somebody else will cite Isaacson's book,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.180]   and will cite Steven Levy's books, and a bunch of other books,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.340]   and we'll get a much bigger overall picture.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.900]   I hope he releases-- it would be nice if he
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.860]   would release the interviews.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.060]   He has tapes of all the interviews.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.180]   That would be great.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.540]   Just as transcripts, even for historians.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.300]   Just for base materials, then, for another book
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.980]   that somebody might be doing from a different angle
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.940]   or a different slightly.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.740]   I really liked reading the book.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.660]   I think for people like us who covered these stories,
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.860]   learning the behind the scenes of Intenigate, for instance,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.380]   then Jobs first denying it, then rushing back
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.900]   from Hawaii on his vacation, bringing his son,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.180]   Reed, to be in the meetings all day,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.900]   so that Reed would get a sense of how a business is run.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.420]   All of these things were great tidbits.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.180]   Maybe you're right.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.500]   They don't sum up the man or sum up the story.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.900]   But boy, there's some great material in there.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.140]   Also, it's valuable if only for this.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.620]   This is the longest first-person account
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.820]   that Steve has ever given about himself and the company.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.780]   And the other companies he's run.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.740]   And as any first-person narrative runs,
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.180]   a little bit's going to be self-serving,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.620]   a little bit's going to be self-deceptive,
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.060]   but at least it's there.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.700]   And so even if we discover that,
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.900]   well, he wasn't quite so open and honest
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.140]   about the reality of the creation around the iPod
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.620]   or decisions that made it to the screen of this device,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.460]   the fact that we will now know that 10 years from now
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.340]   that actually know this is exactly how it went,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.500]   and he was either uninformed about that,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.660]   or he decided to ignore stuff that he was actually told,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.380]   even that will give us more information
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.460]   about himself in the history.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.660]   So I don't think there's any way to define this book
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.060]   'cause anything but an important book.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.060]   - Yeah, I do think though that if people are interested
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.260]   in this subject, they should listen to John Syracuse's
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.820]   member critical number 42, I think is the one
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.460]   we're in now number 43.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.300]   They're good.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.900]   John, I do a podcast with John too.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.740]   - He's brilliant.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.580]   - He's a smart guy.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.420]   His points are strong.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.300]   He's coming from a very specific perspective
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.500]   of what kind of book he wanted to see,
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.540]   and I think you need to take that.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.380]   But it is also kind of an epic rant
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.620]   about why he dislikes a book,
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.740]   and it is delightful to listen to an epic rant.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.620]   - And the show is after all called "Hiber Critical."
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.420]   - Yes, he does what it says on the team.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.860]   (laughing)
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.300]   - I mean, that's fair enough.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.260]   Yeah, it's at five by five, and yeah,
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.220]   I'm gonna listen to it 'cause in fact,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.340]   thanks to Dave Weiner for recommending it,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.900]   I'm gonna listen to it.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.940]   But you know, people like Dave, not so much John,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.860]   but people like Dave have very much of an axe to grind.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.060]   They have a point of view, and so.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.900]   - Yeah.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.860]   - If it doesn't match his point of view,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.460]   he's not gonna like the book, frankly.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.540]   - Yeah, I mean Dave, he's interesting.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.900]   The great thing about a personality like Dave
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.220]   is that you will never have any question
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.860]   about how he feels on a subject.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.060]   The only difficulty is that,
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.740]   and I've worked with him on like feature articles
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.140]   that I've written about some of his products
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.220]   and some of other people's products,
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.460]   it just seems like there is never any yes but,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.700]   or I assume that this is true and based on that assuming,
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.980]   no, it's either A or B.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.820]   - It's black and white.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.340]   - Well, Dave himself says,
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.820]   I'm probably a little bit like Steve,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.700]   myself, our story's kind of our parallel.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.940]   And that's an interesting admission even in itself.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.860]   - If you read earlier today's blog,
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.540]   he once made like an Ikea bookcase,
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.300]   but he replaced the back panel with solid platinum.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.140]   (laughing)
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.340]   It's important that the back look just as good as the front.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.180]   - You see?
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.020]   - You see?
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.820]   - So there is a certain synchronicity of hot.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.300]   - You see?
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.260]   - I'm kind of like Abraham Lincoln.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.100]   I'm just saying.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.940]   - Yeah, no.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.780]   Why not?
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.860]   - No, I knew Lincoln.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.780]   I worked with Lincoln, and you are no Lincoln.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.700]   No, I think we'll all agree.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.980]   It's an important book.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.140]   If you're interested in this subject,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.260]   and if you're listening to Mac Break Weekly,
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.020]   you probably are, it's certainly a must read.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.860]   - Right.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.220]   - And then I think, I hope you're right, Jason.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.700]   There'll be many, many books to come.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.540]   Maybe--
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.060]   - There's gonna be a book about the technical history
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.860]   of Apple in the jobs era and the decisions they made.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.100]   Probably after some of those people have left Apple
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.300]   and can talk about more freely.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.140]   - That's right.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.980]   - And that's gonna be a great book.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.820]   This isn't it.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.460]   This is semantic notes from that period,
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.260]   but it's not it.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.860]   - But one thing we're learning,
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.220]   and I'm gonna talk about it in just a second,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.100]   that apparently Steve wanted its own,
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.580]   the iPhone have its own carrier, its own network.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.660]   Christina Bonnington writing on wired.com.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.980]   We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   But first I would like to mention our friends at Ford,
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.780]   the Ford Motor Company,
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.820]   makers of fantastic products,
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.420]   the best cars out there right now,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.140]   and you could find out more about the technology involved
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.580]   by going to Ford.com/technology.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.820]   You know, I talk a lot about Ford Sync,
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   'cause I'm a beloved Mustang with Ford Sync,
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.980]   and of course the new My Ford Touch.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.420]   And I probably don't mention
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.980]   the kind of the key feature of it enough.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.140]   I talk all about how it's like Siri for a car.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.660]   You can tell what temperature, what song to play.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.100]   It ties in with Pandora.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.180]   But you know, it's also a really good GPS.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.980]   I probably should mention that.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.660]   Again, the whole idea of Sync is that you could do everything
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.980]   in the car without taking your hands off the wheel
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.900]   or your eyes off the road.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.140]   That's really important for safety.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.220]   They don't want you looking down at the screen
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.380]   and checking stuff.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.620]   They want you, for instance, for navigation,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.860]   to press a button on the steering wheel,
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.620]   say this is where I wanna go.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.820]   You can give it a street address,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.260]   you can give it a point of interest.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.900]   They have really enhanced it now with 40 million businesses.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.540]   So it's got a complete database
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.380]   of pretty much any business you'd wanna go to,
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.100]   and that includes telephone number and directions.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.620]   So you can say a point of interest,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.660]   you could say, I wanna go to the Dunkin' Donuts,
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.900]   nearest Dunkin' Donuts,
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.020]   and it will not only give you directions, just like that,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.380]   but you can call 'em, call ahead
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.300]   and make sure they've got that extra Krispy Kreme
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.220]   that you want.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.380]   Oh, did I say Krispy Kreme?
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.100]   They probably don't call it that.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.020]   And it'll be waiting for you.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.700]   So it's, they have,
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.420]   now this is what I was a little confused about
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.060]   'cause it says that they have arrows on the screen.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.500]   I thought, well, of course they have arrows on the screen.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.140]   Well, kind of, but this is cool with my foretouch.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.100]   You've got a big screen here with the GPS,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.500]   but you also have two little screens behind the steering wheel,
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.340]   and this is the beauty of it.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.580]   You don't have to look down.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.980]   The arrows come on the screen there
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.380]   and tell you which way to turn.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.580]   So you really are keeping your attention on the road.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.340]   I think that's, it's little things like that
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.180]   that make a huge difference.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.580]   And this is where Ford's really putting some thought.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.900]   They also have an app.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.860]   They have an iPhone and Android app.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.700]   So you can, for instance,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.420]   you can be on your computer
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.180]   and send directions to your account,
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.780]   my Ford Sync account.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.820]   They call it Sync Traffic Directions and Information Systems.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.700]   You send it to the account,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.540]   then it sends it to the car.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.420]   You can call it up from the car.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.780]   So it's a great way of feeding the car
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.820]   your destination before you leave.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.660]   They also will have things like,
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.180]   they'll send you traffic updates to your phone
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.380]   if you have the app on your phone.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.980]   It's just, the idea here is to integrate
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.060]   your personal technology with a car.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.700]   So the car really becomes an extension
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.380]   of your personal technology.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.500]   And I think this is just brilliant.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.460]   And something no one had ever done before.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.540]   Traditionally, the information systems and cars were awful.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.100]   Not the Ford Sync in my Ford Touch.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.940]   You gotta try it.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.780]   The best way to do it,
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.340]   be go to Ford dealer near you,
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.340]   say I wanna try the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.180]   It's got all the great state of the art stuff.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.060]   Or go to this website,
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.340]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.540]   And read about there,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.540]   the EcoBoost engine, the plug-in hybrids.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.660]   I'm gonna get an all electric.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.860]   I just think that's cool.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.100]   Just really kind of a great thing to have.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.700]   My key, the Bliss system with cross traffic alert,
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.820]   the auto park system, it just goes on and on.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.860]   This is such a great car company
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.340]   and a great technology company.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.380]   And I think that's why they're on Mac break weekly.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.940]   They wanna let you know, they are a technology company.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.780]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.820]   Give 'em a try today.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.980]   When Steve Jobs first dreamed up the iPhone
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.820]   with his team at Apple,
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.380]   he didn't want it to run an AT&T's network
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.020]   according to Christina Bonnington.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.340]   He wanted to create his own network.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.900]   Actually, this comes from venture capitalist,
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.460]   John Stanton, who spent a lot of time with Jobs
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.340]   during this period.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340]   Stanton says, "Steve wanted to use Wi-Fi for his phone."
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.820]   This is at a law seminar in a national event in Seattle.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   He and I spent a lot of time talking about whether
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.660]   synthetically you could create a carrier
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.460]   using Wi-Fi spectrum.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.860]   That was part of his vision.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.300]   You know, he might have been a little early on that,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.580]   but I think actually that's gonna be doable
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.700]   as we get more and more people putting Wi-Fi in the sky.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.740]   - Yeah, I mean, it's clear that Steve Jobs' default position
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.140]   on anything was why do we have to do it the way
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.340]   it's always been done?
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.340]   Isn't there something that way to do it?
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.420]   - And why don't we do it?
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.180]   Why do we have to partner with anybody, right?
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.540]   - Exactly, that's it.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.060]   Why do we have to be beholden to a carrier?
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.540]   Why can't we control absolutely everything?
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.140]   And I mean, AT&T and Verizon have enough problems
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.580]   getting coverage in Vermont as it is.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.940]   I can't imagine if they have a brand new standard
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.940]   that requires brand new sub-licensing spectrum
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.100]   and sub-licensing property to erect these,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.060]   what I would assume would be a new series of towers
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.820]   to support this new network.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.100]   Ooh, I'm glad that someone talked them out of that one.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.300]   - Well, it's interesting 'cause this guy's Stanton
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.540]   venture capitalist, but he was employee number one
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.020]   at McCaw Cellular, which was the,
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.780]   I think the first cellular company in the US,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.220]   one of the very earlier ones,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.420]   it became AT&T wireless, they acquired McCaw.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.540]   So he knows where of he speaks.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.140]   And probably maybe he was a guy who talked him out of it,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.500]   but I would love to see him.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.260]   We now people, you hear people talking about Google
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.380]   doing that or Apple coming back and doing that.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.940]   It certainly is a business that's ripe for reinvention,
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.780]   I would say.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.980]   - Right, and that seems to be that what jobs
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.380]   in Apple have always been about is,
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.420]   is there something out there that everybody hates,
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.980]   but seems to be the only way you can do it,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.380]   and then can we do it better?
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.220]   And in this case, yeah, it doesn't seem like it was practical.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.060]   - Yeah, it doesn't.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.620]   Let me look what they did with thy message.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.220]   It was so much easier for them to say,
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.180]   we can reinvent text messaging by just using
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.140]   our network connection just as a source of internet,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.740]   and then putting everything on that internet connection.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.780]   But the idea of let's talk to every church,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.820]   towel, every owner of every church steeple,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.900]   every water tower, every disused of a smokestack
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.860]   from every abandoned factory,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.220]   and get some sort of coverage working.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.900]   That's not a conversation that Apple would want
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.780]   to have with these people.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.020]   - By the way, I apologize, Jason.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.300]   This was an IDG story appearing in Macworth first,
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.420]   and I gave credit to Wired, which reprinted--
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.220]   - Okay, we love Wired, we love ours technically.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.580]   - But Nancy Garring got these stories.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.860]   - From the IDG News Service, yeah.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.900]   - Initially, and so let's give Nancy credit for that.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.340]   But it was at a public event on Monday that he was speaking.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.220]   To me, I think this is a very interesting idea,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.460]   and I just, maybe the chatroom saying,
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.940]   "Oh, regulators have never allowed."
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.540]   Well, that's kind of the purpose of Wi-Fi.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.660]   It's unregulated spectrum.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.980]   You don't need regulators, right?
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.620]   - Well, maybe they would have had some sort of strategy
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.820]   where they were piggybacking off of cell networks
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.380]   when they didn't have the Wi-Fi signal or something like that,
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.420]   and something that was totally outside the box,
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.940]   and maybe they talked to the cell providers,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.380]   and they said, "Ha, you're crazy."
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.220]   - You're nuts!
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.260]   - And it all just didn't happen.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.140]   But I love that.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.700]   I mean, one of the other stories on our little rundown here
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.780]   is about jobs in the Apple television,
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.180]   and the war on buttons,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.260]   how Apple hates remote controls with lots of buttons,
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.620]   or devices with lots of buttons,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.100]   and it's that same attitude of like,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.340]   "I know that every remote control has a lot of buttons.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.180]   Why?"
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.060]   And just asking, "Why does it have to be that way?"
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.380]   And maybe there's a good reason,
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.260]   and I certainly been, they did that iPod,
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.980]   what was it, the iPod shuffle that had no buttons,
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.900]   and it was terrible, and they put the buttons back.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.900]   - At least they had the sense to put the buttons back, right?
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.740]   - Yeah, yeah, it's true.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.380]   But there is with Apple the sense
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.580]   that they're always trying to just break the tradition
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.460]   and say, "What if we did it differently?"
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.660]   And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.780]   - I think everybody agrees.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.060]   We would like to see Apple tackle TVs.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.580]   In the same way they tackle cell phones,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.780]   which were horrible before the iPhone,
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:02.820]   you compare a direct TV or an XFINITY remote
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.500]   with the Apple remote, there's a massive difference.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.220]   - Right, but I can get to my channel
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.940]   on my direct TV remote very quickly,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.660]   and on my Apple TV remote,
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.500]   - It's not so, yeah, exactly.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.340]   - That would be easy.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.620]   - A bunch of clicks and a bunch of moving around
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.460]   with arrows and--
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.820]   - Well, that's really, I feel that the iPad
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.660]   could be very useful.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.260]   I mean, this really could be a very smart interface.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.420]   - Yeah, and the direct TV app is actually pretty good
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.540]   for that. - Better on that, yeah.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.380]   - Yes, yes and no.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.580]   There's some areas in which you really don't want
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.980]   to over innovate, and one of the problems
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.020]   with operating a remote control with this instead of this
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.060]   is that there's bumps on this thing here.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.500]   And if it's, well, this thing is a regular remote, by the way.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.900]   This is the remote for my--
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.220]   - For people who are listening, Andy,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.140]   I'm just explaining that you're--
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.220]   - Sorry, this is the remote for my video camera.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.500]   And just to make myself look more intense as I say this--
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.780]   - It looks like-- - Yes, we will obey.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.140]   - And the rest of the-- - That's sputin'
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.460]   the mad monkey. - That's why these
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.460]   concentric circles behind me, they're designed
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.220]   to start spinning whenever I feel as though people
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.780]   aren't really listening to me.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.060]   But yeah, I mean, you tend to be looking at the TV screen
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.860]   while you are operating a remote, and with nothing but glass
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.180]   underneath your thumb, your thumb's gonna walk around
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.100]   a little bit, even if you're hitting the same button
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.140]   over and over again.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.580]   So that's why I think one of the most innovative things
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.460]   that Apple could do with the Apple TV,
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.660]   if they're not gonna do voice command,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.940]   is just to give us a larger remote that is harder to lose,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.580]   that fits in your hand a little bit better,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.460]   if you're going to be spending at least a minute and a half
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.780]   on a certain operation, like tapping in passwords
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.980]   for different social network services.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.660]   So sometimes it's not, you don't want Gee whiz Bluetooth
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.700]   and quad-roople multi-touch.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.900]   What you want is just here is a conventional
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.500]   remote with conventional buttons,
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.060]   that fits really easily in your hand
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.380]   and it's not gonna get lost.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.900]   - Don't you find it interesting that Nielsen reports
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.780]   they did a survey that 70% of all iPad use,
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.780]   7-0% of all iPad use occurs sitting in front of the TV.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.780]   - It doesn't surprise me.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.060]   - You're already doing that.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.620]   - There's a comm-score study that also says
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.780]   that almost all tablet use, which is really all iPad use
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.340]   at this point, is either, there's a big bump early
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.140]   in the morning and there's a huge bump late at night.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.380]   So you're not just watching in front of the TV.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.740]   You're using it in bed when you get up in the morning
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.900]   and before you go to sleep and that's, yeah.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.580]   But to Andy's point, I have a Logitech universal remote
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.140]   and it's the one with buttons and now they make a new snazzy
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.140]   one that's a touchscreen and I won't buy it
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.180]   because I want to feel the buttons
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.260]   'cause I know where the buttons are and that's it.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.180]   Whether there's something Apple could,
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.660]   it would be really cool without putting the buttons.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.140]   - I think you guys are old farts.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:38.980]   - It could be.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.820]   - I think, no, I think maybe it's possible.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.700]   I'm an old fart too, but it's all--
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.020]   - You knew Abraham Lincoln, so yeah.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.420]   (laughing)
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.260]   - But I just think that, by the way,
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.620]   that was, I think, a Ronald Reagan line.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.460]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.620]   - I knew Lincoln.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.660]   - No, it wasn't.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.700]   - You are.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.260]   Or was Woodrow Wilson or somebody.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.780]   I do think that the speculation that maybe Siri
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.540]   has a big part to play in this hat,
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.420]   it would eliminate the need for buttons
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.220]   if you could just talk to your TV
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.460]   or talk to a vice at talk to me.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.180]   - I talk to my TV now, but it doesn't listen.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.020]   - Yeah, it doesn't listen.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.860]   - Stupid TV.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.740]   - Don't send us toward that third act plot twist
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.060]   that we know is happening.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.900]   - No, no, no!
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.260]   - Call the police, call the police, don't go in the road.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.580]   - Don't go in the road, I'm a vampire!
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.700]   - So I just think that the idea of saying
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.260]   play gossip girl or rewind 30 seconds
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.220]   or rewind five minutes eliminates the need for buttons
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.300]   or glass.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.700]   - I don't think you could ever eliminate it.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.140]   I think it's a good adjunct because so much
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.340]   of what you're selecting is really search.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.900]   I don't care what channel American Chopper is on.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.820]   I just want you to tune into whatever channel.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.380]   I know it's on now somewhere.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.500]   Just find me American Chopper and tune to that thing.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.220]   Or if it's on my DVR, play the last episode of "House."
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.700]   But there are times when you are,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.700]   if I'm splitting my attention between the iPad and the TV,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.260]   skipping back 30 seconds to pick up a line of dialogue
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.420]   is not necessarily a Siri.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.300]   Please skip back 30 seconds, sort of mental operation.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.020]   It's more of a sort of operation, isn't it?
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.340]   - I guess.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.620]   - So aren't we though re-learning a lot of things?
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.260]   You might've said that a year ago
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.500]   that setting a reminder or a calendar event
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   was a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.500]   I'm more and more using Siri.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.260]   I know this Andy, 'cause I read your Siri review,
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.900]   that you agree that this is the kind of thing
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.740]   that does kind of transform how you think about commands.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.740]   - I'm not saying any of that for sure.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.060]   I'm just saying that it's hard for me to imagine
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.460]   the idea of doing this being simpler
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.220]   than activating any sort of a voice interface
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.260]   for many operations.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.420]   And it also applies to channel surfing
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.820]   because there are times when you don't necessarily
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.100]   have a specific target,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.740]   you just wanna go blip, blip, blip, blip, blip,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.580]   your favorites.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.420]   - That's true.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.540]   - I just think that it's an interesting
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.300]   and very subtle problem.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.620]   And I think that the first thing that I would love
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.340]   to read long form after the release of an Apple TV
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.420]   is I wanna have a conversation with the lead engineer
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.780]   who is working on the remote,
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.300]   'cause I bet he had a really cool intellectual
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.980]   and sociological adventure over the year and a half
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.380]   it took him to figure out exactly
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.900]   what this remote should be.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.860]   - There's also the point to be made
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.020]   that the television business itself
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.360]   isn't a very good business right now.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.980]   HDTV manufacturers pretty much wrote the year 2011 off,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.660]   partly because almost everybody has an HDTV that wants one.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.100]   We know that because Friday we're gonna see amazingly
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.740]   cheap HDTVs as they try to clear the stock.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.100]   - Although that's Apple's game, isn't it?
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   - Well, exactly.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.580]   So there might be an opportunity
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.540]   because the TV manufacturers,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.260]   I think that's why they brought in 3D.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.220]   How can we get people to buy a new HDTV?
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.380]   They already got one and they're happy with it.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.420]   And we've saturated the market everybody wants one has one.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.460]   So what do we do?
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.900]   3D is not the solution,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.260]   but maybe a very easy to use
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.500]   some how internet connected Apple style devices,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.340]   the solution.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.980]   I don't know.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.220]   - I think the solution most,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.340]   it involves voice control,
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.300]   but I think it mostly involves licensing.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.100]   I think it's basically about piles and piles
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.700]   of licensing agreements being signed
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.380]   by increasingly skeptical executives
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.140]   at the people, companies and networks.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.340]   I think that's where the real innovation is gonna be.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.380]   It was just as important at Fridays
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.220]   that they simply find ways that we can get
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.860]   every single music company on board with the service,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.540]   find a way to give them what they want
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.420]   and yet protect what we think is important
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.540]   to make the service work.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.740]   That was as important as the iPod,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.940]   that was as important as developing iTunes,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.660]   it was important as the e-commerce system
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.660]   that powers iTunes.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.460]   It was just those agreements.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.620]   - And it gets more difficult to make those agreements
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.860]   as these people have wise up.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.060]   I mean, one of the things I did learn
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.460]   from the Isaacson book was that Jobs was able
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.140]   to make these music company agreements
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.860]   with a carrot and a stick.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.380]   The stick was you're gonna get people are robbing you blind,
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.180]   bit torrent's gonna do it anyway
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.260]   and you can make some money this way as the carrot.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.020]   And finally, the reason the record company executives
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.300]   agreed to it according to the book is,
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.180]   well, it's just Apple.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.540]   We can, you know, it's gonna,
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.460]   how big a part of the market could they be?
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.220]   We don't have to worry about this iPod thing
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.460]   as never going anywhere.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.540]   And instead it takes over the entire music industry.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.780]   And I think now, oh, they've been burned a little bit.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.900]   They're a little less likely, a little more reluctant.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.020]   - There's some never again kind of that.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.860]   - Yeah. - It's funny,
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.220]   never again, when we let some companies
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.100]   solve our problem for us.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.620]   - Right, make money for us.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.140]   - Shocking. - Yeah.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.820]   - But that's death, that's death, isn't it though?
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.000]   Because nobody is going to want to have eight different
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.860]   boxes to get eight different, eight different,
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.060]   - But that's what we've got now.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.500]   And it's terrible situation.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.980]   But the problem is all the stakeholder,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.540]   none of the stakeholders get along.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.380]   Nobody wants to give any one company
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.180]   that much power ever again.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.740]   So they're all just gonna go like this,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.300]   Comcast is gonna fight, HBO is gonna fight,
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.900]   you know, the guys who make the content are gonna,
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.300]   nobody's gonna agree, we gotta mess.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.500]   And I don't see anybody, especially Apple,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.020]   cutting through that Gordian mod.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.540]   - Somebody will do it eventually,
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.200]   but I think that, 'cause I think at the end of the day,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.080]   it's inevitable that companies like Comcast
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.680]   are going to give up and realize that they're
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.200]   a company that's a pipe.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.160]   - Give up Comcast. - Well in variety of--
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.640]   - Give up, right? - It's like they all wanna
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.600]   say, well no, no, we're not just a pipe
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.240]   that transmits bytes to your house.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.720]   We have content and stuff, but in the end, they don't.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.920]   - I had this conversation with one of the most
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.880]   forward thinking cable companies in the country,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.000]   cable vision, eight years ago, it was,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.920]   I think it's Comdex, if not a CES,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.900]   but I think it was Comdex, that's how long ago it was,
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.160]   saying guys, why don't you just give up
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.740]   and admit that you're a pipe?
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.440]   And they said, you know, our business model
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.460]   will not allow that.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.320]   We need the premium subscriptions,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.200]   we cannot sell bits wholesale,
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.940]   we can't stay in business that way.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.360]   - Yeah, well that's one of the encouraging things
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.340]   about these cable companies, excuse me,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.220]   these cable networks coming together
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.300]   because they would love to cut out Verizon,
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.420]   they would love to cut out Comcast if they could,
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.560]   because not only would they have the ability
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.360]   to get access to get closer to dollar one
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   for each subscriber, they really wanna have
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.760]   that information that they can gleam from subscribers.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.240]   - You said the cable companies, you mean the content
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.080]   companies?
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.520]   - That's why I cut out the networks, the HBO, TNT,
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   - Not even, - Discovery,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.880]   - Whoever produces stuff, I think that's why
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.840]   Netflix just is buying, they're producing modern family
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.040]   because they, - The rest development
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.840]   - I'm sorry, rest development. - Modern family
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.680]   already has a network.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.360]   - Right, rest is-- - And at Kevin Spacey
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.240]   produced show, - House of Cards.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   - And I think that that's an acknowledgement
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.120]   that Netflix has to be in the content business
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.600]   in the long run, didn't we always,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.120]   didn't we always say that content was king
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.080]   and that in the long run you bet,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.960]   your best bet is on content, not on a delivery
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.800]   because the delivery is going to change.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.520]   - Yeah, well one of the interesting things
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.440]   about Conan O'Brien's deal with TBS was that
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.360]   he not only wanted ownership of the show,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.160]   he got a David Letterman style deal
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.800]   where he owns his own show, it's not owned by,
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.960]   a part owned by TBS, but also because they own
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.400]   all the digital rights to it.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.680]   So that means that they can essentially build
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.960]   the Conan O'Brien app or the Conan O'Brien streaming
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.320]   as a separate product and monetize it differently.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.440]   - Brilliant, brilliant. - So I think we're gonna see,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.920]   there's always those cool phases,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.280]   whenever there's a shift in media where the large companies
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.920]   are either unaware that their money stream is like
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.600]   diverting through this new channel,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.240]   it's not going through the same canal
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.160]   that's always been through,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.400]   it's actually sort of being going off through this mountain
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.360]   instead where they ignore it and they will simply allow people,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.880]   oh, of course you can have the digital,
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.920]   the stupid negotiator, he wants the digital streaming rights
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.360]   to his TV, so sure.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.280]   - Sure, of course.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.080]   - You know, unbeknownst to them,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.440]   they're actually giving away something valuable.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.680]   And what happens like in five years time,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.480]   it becomes another part of like corporate ownership
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.680]   where they're going to simply say,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.760]   not only are we not going to air your show
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.000]   unless we have at least 58% ownership of it,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.320]   we're also always gonna retain the digital broadcast rights.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.120]   - I think that's already been in there,
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.480]   that's been in the contracts for almost anybody
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.320]   except somebody with the cloud of a Conan and Brian, always.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.720]   I mean, I remember the cable deals with the Tech TV did,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.760]   you know, they get the rights to every,
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.000]   you know, the cable company gets the rights to everything.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.760]   They even said to us, and then in 1998,
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.200]   and by the way, you cannot stream this on the internet,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.040]   they're not stupid, they knew that this was gonna be
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.000]   a threat to them.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.640]   And normal contracts say,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.440]   rights to every medium known now or ever in the future,
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.240]   that's the norm, is that we get all rights
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.080]   and you have to be a Conan and Brian to say,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.680]   well, you know, give me the digital rights,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.840]   I don't think anybody,
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.560]   except if you're the next iteration of Conan and Brian,
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.160]   you don't even care about TBS to begin with.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.000]   - Right.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.840]   - You're probably either--
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.360]   - Hello, welcome to Twitter.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.280]   - Taking Leo LaPorte out to dinner,
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.800]   or you're taking Leo LaPorte out to dinner,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.040]   and then it's like, okay, so let's see what,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.600]   how can I compete with Leo LaPorte?
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.160]   He seems to have unattractive doofuses
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.480]   like Andy and I go on his shows,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.560]   we'll have handsome people on their own show,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.920]   that's the next one, excellent.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.400]   - One word, my friend, cleavage.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.040]   - I get that. - Not yours, please, thank you.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.920]   - A little hairier than people like them.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.320]   - Hey, again, there's a market for everything.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   - No, I really think that's where we're headed,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.640]   is the power really lies in the hands
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.040]   of the content creators ultimately.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.120]   Somebody in the chairman said something very brilliant,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.640]   that ABC, NBC, CBS really are in effect
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.240]   venture funds for content creators.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.200]   Somebody's gotta give you the million dollars to produce,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.120]   you know, rest of development.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.280]   So you gotta go to somebody hat and hand,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.000]   but that structure could change very rapidly.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.200]   - Well, the problem is that the networks own
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   their own studios, and a lot of the shows
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.280]   that are on the networks are from their studios,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.960]   so they're funding themselves.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.440]   - That's like the old record companies, right?
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.000]   The record company said you want a deal,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.840]   you need a record deal,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.760]   because it's a hundred thousand dollars to make a record,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.720]   because the studios are so expensive,
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.120]   but all of that is changing.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.000]   Well, look at we built this studio, right?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.680]   All of that is changing, so what is the event?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.520]   - Right, you just need to crack in the business model,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   where somebody has enough leverage to say,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.240]   you know what, we could walk away from you,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.080]   and just do the internet, and that changes the terms.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.920]   Like HBO, obviously I don't know,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.840]   I'm not privy to what HBO's relationships are
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.200]   with all the cable and satellite companies,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.240]   I get the sense that HBO is such a must have,
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.960]   that those guys, and they've gotten so much money
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.000]   out of those, HBO's an expensive channel,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.920]   if you're just a regular end user,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.040]   would not surprise me if they're the ones who say,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.080]   you know what, we're gonna also offer a subscription
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.800]   that's all internet, and are the--
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.480]   - They try to chase it out like that.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   - And are the-- - HBO go,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.680]   and what do you have to do to have HBO go?
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.480]   - Well right now you have to be a,
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.400]   like a direct TV or a counter-comcast subscriber,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.480]   - You have to sign on to your Comcast account.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.080]   - But wait, it would not shock me
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.200]   if there's another shoe to drop at some point,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.160]   and it'll be interesting to see,
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.680]   because is Comcast gonna say,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.000]   if you do that we're gonna stop carrying HBO,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.800]   do you realize what a competitive disadvantage
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.160]   that would put Comcast at?
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.560]   - Well, we're seeing those battles go on,
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.280]   Fox fighting with the direct TV,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.000]   you're seeing that go on right now in many markets
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.040]   with the cable companies, with the satellite companies,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.400]   and the content creators.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.440]   Ultimately though, what does a network offer beside?
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.800]   They offer cash, they offer distribution,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.040]   they perhaps offer studios.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.840]   That's exactly what happened in the music industry.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.760]   You don't need studios,
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   suddenly the internet that does your distribution,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.960]   you don't need the cash, we're seeing that.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   Now, you still need a lot of money to make a Star Wars,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   you still need a lot of money to make a Sopranos,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.360]   but that money can come from a lot of sources,
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.200]   it doesn't have to come from the traditional sources,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.480]   it could come from a Netflix,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.920]   or it perhaps could come from an app,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.240]   you could perhaps bootstrap it.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.120]   What if you wrote a Sopranos app,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.840]   you did a cheap Sopranos, made some money on it,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.320]   better, better, better, better, better,
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.480]   you could bootstrap up to a million dollar in episodes.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.840]   - It keeps Sopranos, that's a whole show about Tony,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.520]   not wanting to pay the bill in the diner.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.120]   - Hey, I only ordered the soup.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.320]   The whole thing takes place in the pig store cafe.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.920]   It's all, and then I shot again.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.520]   - That's not very good.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   - But there's an obstacle against that,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.600]   because right now,
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.560]   there's a difference between the way
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.120]   that these companies can promote the hell out of content,
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.200]   and put it in front of as many eyeballs as possible.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.920]   A failing show that maybe limps along until a second season,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.120]   and then almost immediately goes on a hiatus,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.640]   has about 10 times the viewership of, I think,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.160]   of most podcast shows that could be considered
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.000]   as a great success.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.160]   - There's a marketing value, exactly.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.760]   - Even in the world of comic books,
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.960]   if you have 15,000 regular readers,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.920]   you can support yourself handsomely
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.760]   off of your readership of yourself publishing.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.840]   That's 10,000 issues below the cutoff point
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.160]   from that Marvel, and usually considers it's time
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.080]   to cancel this book.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.920]   - Right.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.000]   - So, I think part of the last thing I just wanna say,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.960]   though, is that I think that the key to this revolution,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   in addition to the technology,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   is just going to be creators who now,
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.000]   their wildest dream is now to make a quarter million dollars
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.760]   a year.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.960]   Right now, we still have actors and producers
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.800]   who's wildest dream is to make a million
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.280]   or 10 million dollars a year,
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.960]   'cause actors are not moving to Hollywood saying,
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.320]   "You know what, I got a sitcom,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.280]   "but I'm making over $4,000 an episode."
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.920]   It's like, no, they wanna be Charlie Sheen,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.360]   they wanna be getting a million plus.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.200]   - Well, get over it.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.160]   Get over your bad self.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.320]   Same thing for record artists,
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.640]   you can't platinum artists,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   I don't know if that's gonna happen much anymore,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.680]   but if a million people can make money and make a living,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.360]   I think that's better than if one person
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.240]   makes a bunch of money.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.080]   - I agree.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.920]   - My thoughts.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.000]   - Macintosh, we haven't talked about Macintosh in a while.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.080]   Boy, the MacBook Air is a huge success,
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.120]   according to NPD.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.400]   The Air is 28% of Apple's notebook shipments.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.360]   That's a 20% increase over the first half of the year.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.440]   This July refresh, I have the old 2010 MacBook Air.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.960]   - I got the new one right here.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.640]   - Big difference?
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   - Well, it's a lot faster.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.480]   - Yeah.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.320]   - But noticeably.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.160]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.080]   It is the Core i5.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.760]   - I felt like the old Air was so fast,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.000]   because of the SSD.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.840]   - Well, it is.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.080]   This is faster.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.920]   - Even still.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.760]   - But even still.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   And with Thunderbolt,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.120]   there's not a lot of Thunderbolt stuff out there,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.000]   but that means that the MacBook Air,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.360]   which the original MacBook Air,
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.960]   you had one USB port
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.360]   and everything had to go through it.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.480]   And now with the Thunderbolt port,
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.840]   you hook this thing up to a Thunderbolt display
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.000]   or Thunderbolt hard drive.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.120]   You can get Gigabit Ethernet,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.360]   you can get super fast storage on a MacBook Air,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.920]   which is pretty crazy.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.640]   And this is where all of Apple's laptops are going.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.520]   I mean, this question about how big is the MacBook Air
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.840]   will eventually be irrelevant,
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   because I think all of Apple's laptops
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.560]   are gonna be like MacBook Air's eventually.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.160]   - So I have a 15 inch pro here, heavy,
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.280]   and I have an Air and I carry the Air almost everywhere.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.640]   In fact, the pro is in the studio now
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.800]   because I don't wanna have to carry it around.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.720]   I wanna carry the Air around.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.120]   We've heard the rumors that perhaps next year
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.440]   there would be an Air style 15 inch.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.280]   As you think that's-
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.680]   - I think it's inevitable.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.880]   - In fact, will all of the MacBook line go to the Air form?
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.200]   - Well, Apple has traditionally kept a lot of the features
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.280]   in the 17 inch just as the, that's your, well, it's a laptop,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.680]   but it's got all the features of a desktop.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.560]   - If you're crazy enough to want one, go ahead.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.640]   - Right, exactly.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.400]   But I do think there'll be a 15,
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.520]   whether they call it a 15 inch Air or not.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.680]   And then it's a path from there to just saying
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   this is the MacBook.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.040]   - And a 17 inch Air would look so much like a pizza
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.240]   that you really don't want it.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.640]   - Yeah, I think they'll keep something big high end
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.200]   around just for people who want all of that.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.600]   They wanna load it, it's like the Mac Pro.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.640]   It's just, it's loaded up.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.480]   - So when does that happen, January?
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.840]   - I think there's a 15 inch next year.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.160]   I think without the optical drive and all that,
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.000]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.480]   - Yeah, maybe in May.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.320]   - May.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.120]   - But I think it's gonna be a little bit more slow
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.480]   than other people think because you still got a problem
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   where you just can't put a big storage drive inside an Air.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.400]   Without adding $800 or $900 to the price,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.520]   you just can't do it.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.400]   And the people who are using a MacBook Pro
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.440]   as their primary machine, 256 gigs, you can do it,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   but your stuff will probably fit in about 220, 230.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.040]   You will constantly be bumping your head against problems
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.240]   where I'm away for a week.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   I've got this 18 gigabytes worth of video files.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.400]   Oh, nope, I can't put it on this drive.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.440]   So I'm gonna now travel with an external drive
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.480]   to support this machine that I spent a little bit more
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.000]   than it would have cost me if I bought like a normal MacBook.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.400]   But I think Apple clearly made the statement.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.600]   It's not just that they're going towards the MacBook Air.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.800]   It's that they are defining the MacBook Air
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.120]   as the default mobile Mac now.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.760]   The first thing that when the MacBook Air 11 inch came out,
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.200]   the first thing they did was say,
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.680]   "Guess what, the plastic MacBook that cost $999,
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.840]   we're not even offering that as an alternative anymore.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.720]   We're gonna fulfill existing educational orders for it."
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.960]   But now if you want the minimum buy-in for a mobile Mac
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.440]   is the 11 inch Air.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.880]   And that is where the center of the Mac experience is.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.000]   I think they said pretty much the same thing
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.240]   when they introduced the 13 inch Air.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.960]   So I'm not surprised that it's selling so well.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.240]   I'm not surprised that it's such a big wedge of their sales.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.520]   I'm not sure that it's so much
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.240]   because people are naturally gravitating
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.200]   towards these ultra book style super slim,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.240]   super light SSD based machines.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.920]   I think it's because this is now the $999 Mac.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.640]   This is not the cheapest thing you can get.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.560]   And now there's the added benefit of it's actually very,
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.800]   very slick and very, very slim and very, very sexy.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   It's not just the institutional grade Soviet style made.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.360]   How can we, how can we, this is made out of compressed cotton
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.280]   fibers now anymore?
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.760]   - Yeah, I mean, at $999.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.280]   I mean, this is the one that people had, you know,
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.480]   sent their kids off to college with.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.360]   Is that $999 11 inch Air?
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.000]   And I mean, I've got the 11 inch Air here and I love it.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.680]   I do think that unless you've got huge things of HD video
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.240]   and stuff like that, that this push toward cloud services
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.080]   and having things in Dropbox and having your iTunes library
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.160]   stored on a server using iTunes match makes the need,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.800]   I don't feel like I need the hard drive space that I needed.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.320]   And that's the first time that's happened where my necessary
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.000]   hard drive space has decreased ever.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.560]   Because I feel like I've got stuff that I'm storing
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.760]   in all sorts of different locations.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.120]   It's more of an edge case than it used to be.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.280]   I can see it becoming less relevant and, you know,
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.080]   but you're right, SSDs are expensive
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.640]   and they do need to catch up.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.480]   - I have it.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.680]   I think this is sort of a generational thing
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.480]   because people who grew up with,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.560]   there's now a whole generation that,
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.000]   their first word processor, yeah.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.520]   There's a whole generation where their first word processor
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.760]   was an Apple writer, it was Google Docs.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.440]   So they're not used to local storage.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.560]   They're used to dealing with that.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.440]   I can go even better than Jason.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.680]   I've got a 64 gig iPad that I can live off of for several days
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.400]   without really caring about it too much.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.760]   But the big problem is that these aren't my,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.720]   this isn't my primary computer.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.080]   It's not even, and it's certainly not my sole computer.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   I think that if you're in a circumstance
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.600]   where I've got $1,200, $1,300 to spend on a computer
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.320]   that's going to be my one and only machine ever,
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.960]   that's when it becomes a,
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.520]   that's where the rubber meets the road
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.280]   as far as the sacrifices you make
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.480]   for going with the MacBook Air.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.680]   But yeah, I do think that two years from now,
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.080]   the MacBook Pro is going to be like the Mac Pro right now
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.160]   where people are going to start to wonder
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.760]   how many years this product has left.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.600]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.440]   I think it's a two year deal.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.920]   I think people are saying, well, next year,
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.360]   there won't be any more MacBooks with optical drives.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.640]   That's wrong, but it's so clear
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.200]   that this is where Apple's going.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.120]   And I think actually looking at these ultra books
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.320]   that are coming out, it's where the industry is going.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.600]   I think people having these light laptops
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.160]   and not needing the optical drive and SSD,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.000]   I can't believe how fast my MacBook Air is.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.280]   And believe me, as somebody who used the original Air,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   that is not the sense that I ever uttered.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.640]   That was one of the slowest computers I've ever used.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.480]   - It was what it overgifted.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.360]   - And it overgifted me shut down the cores.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.000]   But this thing, it's got a core,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.440]   this one's got the Core i7.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.200]   It's got an SSD.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.040]   I used to edit podcasts on my iMac.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.600]   I gave up, I just used the 11 and share
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.920]   'cause it's way faster because the SSD is so fast.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.560]   - Right. It was so difficult.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.800]   As luck would have it, today was the day
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.360]   that I finally sent back Apple's loaner 11 and share.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.520]   'Cause I was using it for about a month and a half
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.360]   for the review.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.680]   I used it again for another two or three weeks.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.800]   Then I really had to sort of box it up
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.640]   and leave it in the office.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.920]   I was holding onto it so I could test it next to
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.000]   ultra books that were gonna be coming out
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.080]   about a month ago.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.200]   And man, I've never come so close to convincing myself
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.480]   that I need a second portable Mac in my entire life.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.400]   - It's very cute.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.480]   It's very sweet.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.320]   - Yeah.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.160]   - It's not just cute.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.760]   It really is a totally different experience.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.640]   The idea that you can bring a full desktop style Mac
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.880]   with you wherever you go, even if you're concerned
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.440]   about weight, even if you're concerned about
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.920]   whether you're gonna actually use it or not,
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.360]   it really truly cut into my iPad usage
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.920]   because I could just simply toss into the same
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.280]   little light bag for three hours of the coffee shop.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.480]   I wish the battery life were longer,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.600]   but it really is a wonderfully attractive device.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.200]   - I felt like I discovered that with the original Air
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.240]   and I will have to try the new one.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.760]   Is iCloud gonna make that more reasonable too?
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   I mean, you mentioned Google Docs.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.840]   Are people using pages in iCloud or--
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.480]   - Or the iTunes cloud stuff.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.800]   You know, that I was in an airport.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.960]   - You certainly don't have to put your music on there anymore.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.360]   - Yeah, well, they won't fit.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.440]   So there's that.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.560]   But I was in an airport that had free wifi
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.320]   and I was sitting there and I wanted to listen to music
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.160]   and I had like a few tracks on my iPhone,
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   but I just plugged in.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.840]   - Your whole collection.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.520]   - I didn't, iTunes match, started playing,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.920]   did a genius mix on my, you know, and it was all streamed.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.480]   - Does it, okay, but now she's not supposed to be streamed though,
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   right?
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.160]   It's supposed to be downloaded and then streamed.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.280]   - Well, it's downloaded and cached,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.760]   but no, it actually is pretty seamless.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.520]   But you're right, I mean, Andy's about to say,
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.160]   which is right, if you don't have wifi,
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.280]   you still need things stored.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.400]   And that's why I've got a little cache on my iPhone.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.240]   But I've wanted to know--
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   - But everybody knows--
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.120]   - Remember now when you have an iPhone
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.000]   or even an Android phone, you have hotspotting.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.920]   You kind of do have wifi everywhere.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.480]   - Lesser and like, you know, you're--
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.640]   - No, you're a stock rich master.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.480]   - It really chooses, but--
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.560]   - You really don't.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.760]   I mean, I had, I was in Wisconsin last week,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.600]   had a connecting flight,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.640]   so I essentially spent two days in three airports,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.840]   one form or another.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.000]   And you get to that point where I'm sitting here
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.240]   and I'm looking at a public wifi
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.840]   that doesn't really work very well,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.600]   and I can't really get it to work with this machine.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.400]   I don't know why, but okay, there I am.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.000]   Here's another alternative where I can spend $11
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.440]   just to download those eight tracks that I really want.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.880]   I'm not gonna do that.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.000]   So it's kind of a bummer that
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.480]   if we're gonna rely on the cloud,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.920]   we have to have so much more,
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.000]   we have to be so much more aware
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.760]   of the management of our devices,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.840]   and that's gonna take a large adjustment.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.400]   The second problem is that iCloud is probably itself,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.000]   I think two years away from being the,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.680]   fulfilling the promise that was made
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.880]   when it was first introduced
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.720]   at the developer conference earlier this year,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.400]   because it's, even though we've had it for a couple of months now,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.800]   I still don't use it as for a daily production thing.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.400]   I'm still using Dropbox because that's the damn thing
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.520]   that actually works.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   iCloud is still the thing,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.200]   for remind myself, oh, I've got to go to Safari,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.880]   open the web app, choose the file that I just saved locally
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.640]   and drag it into the web app.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.200]   When you do that, it is, I will use that horrible Apple term.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.880]   It is almost magical that it's wonderful when I,
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:46.720]   I'm not,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.880]   - It doesn't just work.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.440]   You have to go through some hoops.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.280]   - It's a dropout.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.120]   - It's great example.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.520]   - And that's why, I mean, I'm not using iCloud to keep my air.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.120]   - This is telling, if neither you nor Andy are using iCloud.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.560]   - I mean iTunes, Mac is working for me.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.880]   iCloud, it's not because it's all tied to the apps
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.960]   and you're not supposed to think of it,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.160]   but until the apps work,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.680]   I have a couple apps that use it.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.040]   But Dropbox has been the thing that has enabled me to use this air
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.880]   a lot of the time,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.200]   and then also have an iMac on my desk at work.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.280]   - We need two things.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.640]   Number one, we need it to be supported on the desktop level
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.040]   as seamlessly as Dropbox integrates itself.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:26.040]   Secondly, Apple needs to just take lots of developers out to dinner,
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.760]   but carry them around in a big Apple branded snuggly for developers
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.120]   and say, "It'll be okay.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.320]   We're going to take care of you.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.880]   We know that iCloud is scary.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.920]   We're not just going to simply toss you off the bridge
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.520]   and hope that you learn how to fly with this.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.040]   We're actually going to give you step-by-step instructions
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   on how to implement iCloud correctly,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.640]   how not to destroy data because--
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.720]   - There's an API.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.840]   - There is an API,
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.040]   but there is shockingly little guidance from Apple
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.360]   on how to use this sort of stuff safely.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.720]   Right now, it's forging, in many ways,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.120]   it's forging an even tighter developer community than before
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.280]   because only through groupthink can they figure out
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.840]   what the huge problems are and the big mistakes
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.240]   that have to be avoided are.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.800]   I was shocked that, I've told this before,
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.360]   when iCloud was first actually released,
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.440]   that I was trying to get,
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.640]   I was after looking through developer blogs
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.520]   and developer message boards for months trying to get a beat
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.120]   on exactly how iCloud was meant to work on the app level,
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.640]   I thought, okay, I guess I'm just too dumb,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.880]   I don't understand it, I'm going to start pinging
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.520]   developers of major apps that I've known for years
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.840]   who even if I can't use the information they tell me,
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.400]   I could at least be educated by them.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.240]   - Which single?
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.920]   - And even them though, for sure, right?
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.360]   - Well, I didn't approach rich on this,
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.160]   but for other people, it was literally,
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   well, here we have no idea how iCloud is supposed
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.520]   to be implemented, we have no idea how it's supposed
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.800]   to respond to the user, one of them actually showed me,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.720]   here are three different, we are planning plan A,
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.480]   plan B, plan C.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.080]   If it's supposed to be like a Dropbox-style seamless
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.800]   syncing service, here's the interface we're going to use.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.920]   If it's meant to be a pack me a lunch for my three days
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.440]   in Aruba, here's the interface we're going to use.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.800]   And if it's meant to be just simply a very simple,
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.560]   click this button to sync your doc service,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.480]   then we're going to use this interface right here.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.960]   That's what scared the hell out of me,
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.000]   that they still on the same page.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.320]   - I have no doubt that iCloud is going to get better,
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.880]   but certainly in this first iteration,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.240]   it looks to me like it was conceived of as a tool for iWork,
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.680]   because one of the problems with iCloud currently
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.800]   is designed is the idea is you have an iPad app,
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.400]   an iPhone app, and a Mac app,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.000]   and they all use the same repository in iCloud,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.680]   and that's great if you use Keynote,
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   or one of these other apps that has all those three versions.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.840]   - We've had that all along.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.000]   - Right, but if you've got--
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.600]   - That was, I worked at com, right?
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.800]   - Yeah, so right, which wasn't that great,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.640]   and this works better, but what happens if you use
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.640]   a text editor on the Mac, and a different text editor
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.880]   on your iPad, and a different text editor on your iPhone,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.560]   my understanding is right now, they won't talk,
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.800]   because each Dropbox, or iCloud box,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.400]   is tied to a specific app signature.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.720]   So it works great for Apple's apps,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.600]   but if you're a developer who doesn't have apps
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   on all three of these devices,
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.400]   you can't really even use it, which is just really disappointing,
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.120]   'cause I want to be able to say I'm using BBEd
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.680]   if you're a scrivener on my Mac,
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.120]   and then I'm using this text editor on my iPad,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.240]   and it just doesn't-- - How can it help you?
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.040]   - No, just doesn't work. - It strikes me very much
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.520]   like MobileMe, the same sort of disaster MobileMe
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.400]   ended up being, and it makes me wonder,
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.920]   is it so difficult to implement cloud strategies?
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.840]   Is that the problem?
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.920]   - I don't think this is a disaster,
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.680]   I think it's just not done, and they decided to release it,
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.960]   and it works fine with Keynote, and it works fine with Pages.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.840]   The problem is, I think it's gonna take another year
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.520]   before developers really can give them the feedback
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.600]   about how they're using it, so that it works.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.520]   Maybe I should say two years,
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.160]   'cause Andy's been saying everything's gonna take two years.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.280]   - By the way, there is one way to fix,
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.240]   perhaps fix this issue on an air, let's say,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.880]   is by putting 3G in the damn thing.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.400]   Why don't we have 3G in our notebooks?
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.960]   - I'm a little surprised that Apple doesn't offer 3G
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.560]   as an option. - Maybe they don't wanna tie
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.600]   the Mac to the carriers, 'cause they hate them so much,
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.120]   but it just seems to me-- - Well, I mean,
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.440]   the iPad is tied. - There's plenty of PCs
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.560]   with 3G's, yeah, I mean, I don't understand
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.720]   why they haven't done that.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.360]   That helps you with your cloud strategy,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.160]   'cause now where there's far more areas we can use it.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.560]   Just seems like that's something to do.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.280]   Let's take a break, we're gonna come back with more.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.480]   We are, what a great panel,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.880]   Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.640]   and do read his reviews, not only the iPhone 4S,
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   but the Siri review just came out, it's very good.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.400]   And of course, Jason Snell of the Macworld magazine
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.320]   who reviews everything all the time.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.160]   (laughs)
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.000]   - All the time. - All the time.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.400]   All the time.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.440]   We wanna thank our friends at hover.com.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.120]   I was just, I, we, Ellie and us, the CEO of TwoCows,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.440]   which is the parent company of hover.com,
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.280]   was out here showing us new stuff.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.080]   These guys are great, I just love it.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   Their message is domain name registration made simple.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.560]   Just, you know, here's what we're gonna give you,
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.080]   domain name registration.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:56.880]   We're just gonna make it easy.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.440]   We're not gonna give you 100 clicks.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.920]   We're not gonna make you have to shoot elephants
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.360]   just to get the thing registered.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.800]   We're just go to, here's the deal,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.680]   go to macbreak.hover.com right now and take a look.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.960]   It is as easy as can be.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.080]   They have some very nice features, for instance,
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.280]   no whole policy for customer service calls.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.360]   If you're ordering business hours,
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.280]   which is Monday to Friday, nine to eight p.m. Eastern,
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.400]   once you get that live person,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.560]   you will never be put on hold.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.680]   They're gonna solve your problem.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.200]   They've really empowered.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.080]   This is one thing that these folks really specialize in,
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.760]   is great customer service.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.320]   They also have a new feature.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.240]   So let's say I wanna register fancypants.com,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.800]   'cause everybody should have fancy pants.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.600]   And I do a search for fancypants.com.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.040]   They now have premium domain names.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.120]   So obviously, I know as I search for this,
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.040]   somebody's gonna own fancypants.com.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.280]   If not, I'm gonna register a real quick.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.440]   Yes, somebody does.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.560]   But look, here's fancy dates.com.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.720]   You see that gold star?
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.960]   This is what we call a premium domain.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.280]   Somebody owns, but they've told Hover,
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   we're willing to sell it,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.040]   and they put the price right in here.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.920]   This means very easily and anonymously,
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.120]   'cause by the way, when Twit calls and says,
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.640]   we wanna domain, it ain't 950 bucks.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.680]   As soon as you tell somebody you wanna domain,
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.000]   suddenly the price goes up.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.040]   There are domains in here, very good domains,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.480]   that are marked for sale by owner,
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.120]   and they put that gold star there.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.920]   That's called a premium domain.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.360]   When you upgrade to a premium domain,
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.520]   you can trade in your clunker domains,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.360]   which is kind of cool.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.680]   Has anybody here ever done this?
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:34.480]   Register to domain that they now use?
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.600]   Quite a few of them, right?
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.960]   'Cause you think, oh, this is a great idea,
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.680]   and I have dozens.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.080]   Those are called clunker domains.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.440]   If you have domains you've registered
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.960]   or renewed at Hover.com,
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.920]   and you'd like to upgrade your domain,
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.600]   Hover will take your old domain name back
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.480]   and give you a credit for everything you've spent with Hover
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   on your clunker, including if you did it at Hover,
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.240]   the online registration fee and any renewal fees.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.440]   That is awesome.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.080]   So get rid of the, now you can register domains
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.160]   without even worrying about it,
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.240]   'cause you know if you're registering that domain,
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.960]   and you don't end up using it,
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.560]   you'll get all your money back from Hover.com.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.600]   And of course, if you're registering a domain name
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.400]   at Hover.com, and if it's not a premium domain,
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.480]   you want 10% off, just use Macbreak as the offer code,
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.920]   and they'll give you 10% off.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.800]   I always do that whenever I register domain name.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.040]   Type in Macbreak, you 10% off.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.160]   If you want to trade in a clunker,
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.080]   call the customer service number on the website,
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.320]   or you can email help@hover.com.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   Look, Hover is the greatest.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   Do not register domain names anywhere else.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.600]   Just do it at Hover.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.680]   I, you know, somebody called me up and said,
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.080]   "Oh, I'm having a hard time moving my domain names over."
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.960]   They have a concierge domain name service.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.760]   If you have hundreds of domain names
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.520]   and you want to move from another service,
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.640]   they'll take care of it for you.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.000]   Just call the number and tell them.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.400]   You heard about it on Macbreak,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.440]   and they'll give you a deal.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.960]   Hover, I love 'em.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.160]   H-O-V-E-R, Macbreak.hover.com to find out more.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.200]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.280]   And just do, you know, do yourself a favor.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.480]   That's it, but the domain name,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.520]   registration, management, interface,
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.360]   fantastic, all of that stuff.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.800]   Hover.com.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   The iPhone 4S is best for browsing on AT&T,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.400]   best for calling on Verizon.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.240]   Yep.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.040]   How are we gonna handle that one?
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.760]   Well, I mean, what, so the 4S uses,
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.800]   doesn't use the 4G.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.640]   It's the HSPA plus.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.520]   It's got HSPA plus, which is a faster 3G,
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.360]   AT&T sort of wants you to call it 4G,
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.280]   but it's not, but it's faster 3G.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   But it's good, I like it.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.120]   And this is when I tested the Verizon iPhone
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:36.960]   when it came out.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.000]   It was, this is totally what everybody found,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.040]   which is AT&T is faster at 3G.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:42.880]   It's better for data.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:43.720]   Then Verizon.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.920]   If you've got 4G, it's a different story,
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.200]   but it's faster at 3G.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.120]   Yep.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.240]   And the calls are more reliable on Verizon.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.600]   I mean, Andy, I don't know about you.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.640]   You tried it in Boston.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.160]   I tried it in San Francisco, and that's what I feel.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.800]   No, I can barely get data in San Francisco,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.360]   whatever I'm in San Francisco.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.200]   It's funny.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.400]   I can tell you exactly where you can't get data
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.320]   in San Francisco, let me tell you.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.360]   I've sort of had some fun, like when I travel,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.600]   I often tweet, like with the,
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.560]   here's the count on all the devices I'm carrying with me
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.280]   for this like two-day trip to Wisconsin.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.520]   It's like I've got four phones, I've got three tablets,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.640]   I've got one notebook.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.320]   And usually that's because while I'm in this other city,
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.560]   I want to see how the Verizon phone works,
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.200]   how the iPhone works, how the Sprint phone works
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.960]   on local networks.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.040]   And the biggest advantage that I find with Verizon
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.120]   is always just simple network availability.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   That when the fastest 3G speeds always go to AT&T,
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.400]   let's leave 4G out of it.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.480]   But in terms of being able to get that 3G signal,
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.920]   I am shocked if I'm ever in a place where Verizon
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.880]   can't deliver me 3G, whereas often,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.080]   I'll just have it in my pocket,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.880]   and I'll hear the,
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.200]   (imitates phone ringing)
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.720]   Oh, AT&T, you're on edge now, aren't you?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.720]   Oh, isn't that adorable?
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.800]   - Yep. - Isn't that adorable?
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.120]   - Yep, yes, sweetie.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.440]   What do kids want for Christmas?
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.560]   An iPad, stupid.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.040]   Nielsen surveys kids six to 12,
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.520]   then 44% of them said they wanted an iPad
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.640]   for the holidays.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.800]   30% said an iPod touch,
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.120]   27% said an iPhone,
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.520]   Apple dominating in the top three,
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.480]   then computer, 25%,
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.000]   and a non-ipad tablet, 25.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.240]   I think that's just a kid who forgot to use the word iPad.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.440]   - Daddy, I want an Android tablet for Christmas.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.880]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.080]   Actually though, the Kindle Fire,
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.120]   if you're gonna get 200 bucks,
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.000]   I think there are gonna be a lot of Kindle fires under the tree.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:35.840]   I think that's a good gift.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.160]   - No doubt, no doubt they're gonna be there.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.680]   - I know the Apple iPad users think it's too sluggish
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   compared to the iPad.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.920]   - I think, yeah, I'm actually,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   I'm reviewing the Nook tablet this week in the SunTimes,
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.280]   and I looked at the draft that I finished last night,
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.840]   and I'm saying I gotta cut this part down,
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.840]   the part where I spent a thousand words
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.040]   basically yelling at everybody who said,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.400]   oh, it's sluggish, the page turns don't look like
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.920]   a raised curved paper anymore.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.760]   - Oh, fair.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.040]   - I lunched it and happened, it took three seconds to,
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.080]   oh, this is a piece of, oh, what a humiliating embarrassment
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.280]   for, oh, for God's sakes, you gotta,
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.320]   you gotta tablet the cost of $299.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.760]   That streams a million different things,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.840]   and you know what, if I had an extra 300 bucks,
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.240]   yes, I would buy an iPad,
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   maybe I don't have an extra 300 bucks,
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.000]   and maybe I don't have a pocket that can hold
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.280]   a thing that's, shh.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.720]   - Yeah, so am I wrong, Andy?
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.520]   Am I wrong in thinking that this is all about
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.000]   people's attitude toward, it's where they're coming from,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.840]   right? - Yes.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.960]   - From like a Kindle, an E in Kindle,
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.720]   you're gonna have a totally different expectation
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.080]   than if you're coming down from an iPad.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.400]   - Well, not only that, I think that when I see
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.280]   not all the, not all the like complaining reviews,
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   but some, but a lot of them,
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.840]   I'm really taken back to those Halcyon days of April in 2010,
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.480]   if those of you who are listening,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.680]   who are really going to think back that far,
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.080]   and you see all these really, really negative reviews
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.040]   the iPad has said, oh, I can't believe they built
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.800]   a net book without a keyboard,
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.720]   it doesn't have even one USB port, let alone three.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.360]   Like, okay, you're an idiot, they didn't decide,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.720]   they tried, they didn't decide,
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.800]   what Apple did was they decided not to build a net book,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.120]   but to take all the things that are people are attract,
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.160]   that attract a net book to, they're attracting a net books,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.600]   small, large battery, a huge battery life, inexpensive,
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.520]   does a certain core group of things extremely well,
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   and they articulated it in the form of the iPad.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.600]   I really think that the Kindle Fire
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.320]   is that exact same thing only applied to the iPad,
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.400]   we're not, they didn't try to make an iPad,
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.280]   they simply said, what is it that people really like
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.880]   about the iPad, and how can we make this into a product
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.960]   that makes sense for us Amazon?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:44.160]   And you start off with 199, not 200199.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.720]   - The only issue with giving,
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.000]   I think the Kindle Fire is great,
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.320]   and by the way, I have the Nook tablet now in my hands,
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.680]   and it's very similar, I mean, it's practically identical,
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.840]   it's just whether you want to be with Amazon or Barnes & Noble,
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.200]   but I do have to say that one of the issues
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.240]   that people are gonna have with, boy, I'm sorry about that,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.400]   that's, I guess it's at a different refresh rate
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.000]   than our cameras, that's funny,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.840]   we did not have that trouble.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   By the way, this is--
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.200]   - That's HTML5, it's the underwater scene.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.040]   - It feels a little smoother, I have to say,
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.160]   than the Kindle Fire.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.780]   - It is, it is, more memory, right?
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.880]   - More storage, but then again, you need more storage
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.440]   on the Nook because you're not backed
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.640]   by the cloud services of Amazon,
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.920]   it's $50 more expensive.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.840]   They're also, they did something,
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.160]   I don't know whether this was technology
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.720]   or just really, really smart,
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.560]   they made sure that they partnered with magazine companies
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.200]   that were more interested in building real apps
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.640]   for delivering the content, as opposed to simply saying,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.880]   if you have a PDF of the New Yorker,
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.000]   here's a wrapper for it that will allow people
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.560]   to manually scroll and zoom through this really grainy-looking
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.080]   JPEG of your actual published page.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.160]   The People Magazine app, for instance,
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.320]   if you buy a copy of People Magazine on the Nook,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.040]   everything is completely formatted
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   for the Nook 7-inch screen,
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.400]   so it's actually a non-painful experience.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.840]   - The only issue I would have with giving an eye,
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.280]   Kindle Fire to a kid is,
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.000]   it's like giving him your credit card.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.320]   You have to kind of log it into an Amazon account,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.720]   and at that point you're screwed.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.960]   I noticed that the Nook,
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.560]   and I actually have to look for this on the,
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.000]   I'm so sorry about the strobing,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.080]   for those of you watching video,
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.880]   we'll have to figure out how we can sync,
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.360]   oh now it's really confused,
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.840]   it's also out of focus.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.480]   But I do notice that the Nook has a require password
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.560]   for purchases,
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.240]   and I think that would be a nice feature
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.960]   to put in the Kindle Fire.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.520]   The Fire has been one click all the way through.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.600]   - I asked them about that,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   'cause I think that's,
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.400]   it's totally unlike the iPad where they assume
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.480]   that kids are gonna try to buy $800
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.760]   for the movies and albums,
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.080]   and they get their holds on it.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.120]   They said that they're aware of it,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120]   they didn't want to get into fear
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.600]   with the consumer process.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.680]   - Sure, and they want to make it easier to buy.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.360]   - Right, well a lot of the decisions they made
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.160]   are really based on what is the least amount of effort
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.360]   required to do just about anything.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.600]   - Well I'm the answer.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.040]   - The Kindle Fire ships logged in too, right?
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.160]   You buy it with your account,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.000]   it'll ship logged in.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.840]   - It's ready to go.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.680]   - It's a security flaw,
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.520]   but it's so great to just take it out of the box
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.120]   and it works, there's a lot of pieces.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.880]   - One difference on this Nook tablet,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.800]   unlike the Fire, it identifies itself as a mobile browser,
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.720]   which the Fire does not do,
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   it says, oh no, I'm a big boy browser.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.840]   You can do anything you want with me.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.000]   - This is very similar though,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.440]   I don't find it that different.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.520]   - But I think they'll sell a lot,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.120]   I think Amazon, I think the Fire is gonna be a hit.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.960]   - I think a lot of people,
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.800]   - I think a lot of people, now.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.400]   - But if you're the kid who has,
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.160]   you're the 44% of kids, six to 12,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.640]   who said they want to have an iPad
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.240]   and you get a Kindle Fire instead,
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.920]   you're not gonna be happy.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.760]   - Are you?
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.600]   - What was that?
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.360]   - I wish I could remember where it came from.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.040]   It was a great joke, like three weeks ago,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.020]   say like,
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.080]   so like a Samsung or somebody came up with like a really
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.800]   cheap knockoff iPad tablet,
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.440]   that's actually being heavily promoted.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.680]   And someone said that it's guaranteed to be the number one
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.840]   gift from well meeting, but not very clever on.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.880]   - Not very savvy, yeah.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.720]   - Yes.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.360]   - I gave you a non-tendo.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.160]   - I got you one of them iPad thing.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.360]   - It has every birth.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.480]   - What's your problem?
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.200]   - There is a new iPad to add, the love ad.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.520]   I'll show you that in just a second.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.920]   Amid rumors that we may get,
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.840]   certainly we're gonna get an iPad three
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.360]   in the spring or summer of next year.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.880]   - It comes after two.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.600]   - It comes after two, it's the next.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.240]   It may be in fact, this is interesting, LTE,
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.280]   like the iPhone six or whatever it is.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.320]   - Why not?
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.280]   - No, Andy, you made such a good point
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.640]   in your review of the iPhone 4S.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.240]   I love the lead by the way.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.600]   I don't wanna misquote it, read it,
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.120]   just go to Chicago sometimes and read it.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.360]   But the point you made is the only people were disappointed
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.200]   with the iPhone 4S,
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.400]   with the people who believed the lame ass rumors
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.080]   about the iPhone 5,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.240]   and said, well, if it's not an iPhone 5,
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.600]   with a bigger screen and 4G, I'm not gonna buy it.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.480]   So I don't wanna get in that game again,
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.960]   because of course there are all these rumors
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.240]   about the next iPhone and the next iPad.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.280]   I will show you though,
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.360]   this is the iPad 2 love ad.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.720]   In a great tradition of Mac Break Weekly,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.680]   I'd like to show you the ads, even though--
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.640]   - For sounds, it's a lifelong passion.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.360]   For others, it's something discovered yesterday.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.760]   - Music, basketball, auto designs.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.360]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.200]   - We'll do that.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.360]   - They drive us to get up.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.120]   - And Andrew, why is apparently used in iPad?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.960]   It's Christina's room.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   - I'm sure, I can talk.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.800]   - I can't wait.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.720]   - Getting lost in the things we love
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.840]   has never felt quite like this.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.200]   - Getting lost in the things we love.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   - What a great central message though,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.280]   and a total 180 from how most of the,
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.320]   excuse me, most of the Android tablets are being promoted.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.480]   - It has LTE, it has the 10.1 inch off T display.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.040]   - Apple is saying the device itself is irrelevant
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.400]   because if you have it, it will integrate so tightly
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.080]   into your life, it will just be the way
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.200]   that you control your music devices.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.440]   It will just be the way that you happen to draw.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.680]   It'll just be the way that if you need a sketch pad
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.960]   so that you can diagram something for somebody,
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.800]   that's how you'll do it.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.200]   It gets out of your way.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.760]   It gets out of your way.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.040]   And it was MG Seagler, I think, who said,
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.920]   are we now in the post speeds and feeds world
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.560]   because of course they're promoting this
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.960]   as twice the speed, twice the RAM.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.360]   People don't care.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.460]   They don't even know what processors in here
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.400]   or the iPad.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.680]   - No, Amazon has done a good job with the Kindle Fireads
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.320]   of trying to appeal very much like Apple
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.800]   to the experience you have.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.760]   And I think that's really smart
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.640]   because in the end, if you play the speeds and feeds game,
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.240]   you're just gonna end up racing to the bottom
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.160]   and it becomes a commodity kind of thing.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.000]   And the reason that Amazon and Barnes and Noble
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.080]   are investing in customizing Android
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.680]   and making it look like their own experiences
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.480]   'cause they don't wanna be another Android tablet,
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.600]   they wanna be like, you can only get this from us,
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.040]   which is the same game that Apple plays.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.560]   - I think you're smart to say,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:06.160]   basically you say, we are immersed in the product
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.480]   and we do the things we love.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.800]   The product is not the point.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.720]   And that's really what Apple has said from day one.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.720]   - You know, when I first saw the iPad in January of 2010,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.680]   I thought immediately, this is the product Apple
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.440]   was formed to create.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.680]   Technology just finally caught up.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.600]   - It's the computer for the rest of us.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.680]   - It is the computer for the rest of us.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.120]   And it gets out of the way.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.120]   - One of my favorite nostalgic little photos
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   was a photo of my iPad on top of my little Kingston stand
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.280]   with my Apple wireless keyboard in front of it
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.400]   with the picture of the original like Mac 128 Hello screen
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.200]   on it because I was just doing,
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.680]   I was just in a pizza place doing some work
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.320]   and I realized that this really is the Mac
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.960]   that Apple originally hoped to build,
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.000]   less than a thousand bucks, ultra portable,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.960]   ultra personal, it's such a big win.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.560]   - We're gonna take a break and come back.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.120]   We have iOS and Mac OS tips.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.520]   - You're gonna do an iOS tip for us.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.280]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.320]   Rock on.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.200]   We also have pics and more, but before we do that,
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.520]   I certainly would like to talk a little bit about audible.com
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.360]   and I bet you Andy has an audible pic.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   This is how I, you know, it's fun
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.240]   because we're seeing the reviews now
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.120]   of the Isaac's in book, but I had to read it fast, right?
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.240]   I wanted to get through it as quickly as I could,
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.000]   best way to do it, naturally audible.com.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.920]   25 hour book, I got through it in less than a week
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.200]   because I listened when I was at the gym,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.080]   when I was in the car, when I was walking the dog,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   you know, it brings reading back into your life.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.320]   And that's, I think, the best pitch of all for audible.com.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.600]   Audio books that play on your iPad, your iPod, your iPhone,
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.920]   of course, your Kindle Fire,
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.360]   if you haven't had one of those, your Android phone,
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.280]   even GPS device, pretty much anywhere you are,
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.480]   your computer as well.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.960]   And that means you can listen anytime, anywhere I have,
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.480]   when I get my car, a book starts.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.200]   I'm right now listening to the Neil Stevenson book,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.080]   Reem D, which I don't think Neil Stevenson actually wrote,
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.040]   but that's just my guess.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.240]   It is such a non-Neil Stevenson book.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.520]   - I don't know, it's a Neil Stevenson book,
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.440]   I'm to the point where it makes that left turn.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.000]   - Oh, I haven't gotten to the left turn yet.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.400]   - Oh yeah, well, wait for it.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   (laughing)
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.080]   It makes maybe turn and then goes for about 500 miles.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:27.920]   - Okay, good.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.160]   Maybe then, I'm waiting for that
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.160]   'cause right now it's pretty prosaic.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.600]   There's some bad writing in it,
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.040]   which I never experienced in my life from Neil Stevenson.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.160]   - Well, he's so big now that he doesn't,
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.880]   I don't think people touch his writing.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.720]   I think I have to watch the authors.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.240]   - Oh, he's not getting edited so much.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.480]   - And he writes so much that, I mean,
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.240]   we've gotta say it, you probably can.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.400]   - He writes long hands too.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.480]   - But I liked it.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.960]   - It's not that I'm a language,
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.120]   it just doesn't seem like a Neil,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.800]   for some reason it's nothing like the Baroque cycle,
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.240]   Kryptonomicon.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.680]   - It's a little snowcrashy with the MMO.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.640]   - It reminds me a little of Daniel Suarez's demon as well.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.240]   I mean, it has a little of that demon feeling.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.480]   It's about a game called T-Rain,
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.240]   this is basically World of Warcraft D.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.720]   Although I love the details about the creation of it,
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720]   that's fascinating.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.520]   And something goes very wrong.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.040]   I think we could say that without spoiling him.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   Reem D, that's also available for free right now to you.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:25.880]   This is the problem,
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.640]   you're gonna pick one book out of 100,000.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.920]   This is a good one too,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.360]   the isexonbooks2audible.com/macbreak.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.000]   Go there, you'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.560]   That's a book of months.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.000]   I think that's a good deal, a very good deal.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.600]   And I think the first month is free,
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.480]   the first book is free and you can cancel at any time,
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.640]   but you get to keep the book forever.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.040]   So that's a good deal.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.480]   We've got two that we recommended.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.000]   Already Player One is supposed to be very good as well.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.640]   A few good things about that.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.480]   No?
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.520]   - It's sort of, hey, if you're from the '80s,
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.000]   it's awesome because it makes it totally awesome in fact,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.800]   because it makes lots of '80s references.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   - I'm not though. - But it is sort of
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.880]   like snowcrashylight.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.200]   I lived through the '80s, but I don't wanna go back there.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.240]   So, okay, I'm gonna pass on that one.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.400]   But some might like it.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.240]   - It's very geeky. - It's a very geeky book.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.040]   It is a lot of fun and we'll read and reading it
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.320]   would be a lot of fun. - Yeah, awesome.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   - But it's, if you read Snow Crash, you sorta read it.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.200]   - How about you, Andy?
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.120]   What you reading these days?
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.680]   - Right now I am reading The Virgin and the Ice,
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.960]   which is one of the earlier Brother Cat-Fell mysteries.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.760]   - I love Brother Cat-Fell.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.880]   - I love him.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.680]   - Yeah, it's just such a great, it's one of those concepts
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.400]   that has explained to you and you gotta figure
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.800]   it's worth six or seven bucks to buy a paperback
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.960]   just to see how this concept works its way out.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.760]   Where the basic concept is that it's the 1100s
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.400]   in Shrewsbury, in England.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.760]   And there is a up and coming, up and coming monastery
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.920]   where the healer and herbalist is Brother Cat-Fell,
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   who unlike most of the other monks who basically were raised
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.440]   by monks and basically entered Holy Orders like at age,
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.720]   like minus eight.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.320]   He basically, he became a monk at age 40, 10 years earlier
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   after a lifetime as a sailor and fighting in the crusades.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.160]   So he has a certain worldliness and understanding
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.400]   of the outside world that the other monks don't have.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.720]   And so when bad things happen in town,
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.280]   he's usually the one who will be the first to realize
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.520]   that maybe it wasn't an act of God
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.360]   that caused this guy to be hanged.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.640]   Perhaps it was actually somebody who killed him.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.520]   Perhaps I should look into this.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.240]   And so it's basically Sherlock Holmes is a monk in 1139.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.880]   It's actually, it's probably closer to Colombo.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.800]   Colombo, okay.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.200]   Because he is kind of the outsider of the monastery
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.480]   because he's again, he's like,
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.680]   he's like the tonsher come lately of the group.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.800]   So he's not really a monk, he just came late to the order.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.160]   Oh, good as wet as he know.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.320]   But nonetheless, like the Abbott knows that,
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.120]   you know what, this is kind of a sensitive diplomatic thing
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   where if the Empress Maud's career got killed
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.880]   as opposed to it went an accident,
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.520]   basically this entire land where we have our church
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.400]   will become an active battlefield.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.720]   Can't file, why don't you go over there
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.200]   with the rest of the delegation who's burying the body,
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.040]   just sort of look around.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.840]   So it's well-written, well-paced.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.320]   And it's just such a, it's of the time that it's placed in,
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.000]   but it's not just, it's not, the author didn't make mistake
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.200]   of writing a 20th century character who lives in the 1100s.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.480]   He really does have the perception of someone
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.680]   who imagined would live in those times.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.320]   So just the disconnection is great.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.920]   Let me ask you this, should you start,
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.200]   I mean, there's a bunch of these.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.040]   Should you start at the first one or does it matter?
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.680]   The first one is a morbid taste for bones,
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.840]   which is also a great book.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.000]   I think I recommended it, it felt like three years ago.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.960]   The, sometimes it's not the first book in a series
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.080]   you wanna try out.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.680]   As a matter of fact, on my other podcast,
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.840]   I was talking about science fiction books
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.680]   that I had never really enjoyed reading.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.680]   As someone was telling me, well, you know,
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.800]   Ringworld is a great series, but you don't wanna start
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.280]   with the first one, you actually wanna start
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.560]   with number eight or number nine.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.400]   - No, that's interesting.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.920]   - When Terry Pratchett actually really figured out
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.840]   the world that he was building and what he was doing.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.800]   And actually, if you'll be confused,
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.000]   maybe for the first chapter,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.760]   but then it's a better ride for the rest of the book.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.200]   I like this one because there's less setup.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.360]   Also, it's a much, I won't spoil anything for you.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.800]   The basic concept is that there is a body,
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.080]   a girl's body is found embedded in the ice
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.960]   and the identity of this woman
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.680]   and how she came to find that end
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.160]   is essentially the thrust of most of the story.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.800]   - Now I gotta warn you, there are three different versions
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   on Audible.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.520]   This is, Audible's gotten so big now
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.800]   that they have multiple copies of the same book.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.160]   - The one I would get is the one narrated by Patrick Tall.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.000]   He is one of my, let me play a little bit of Patrick Tall.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.040]   He is such a good narrator, I just love him.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.640]   - If you had a homeless dog she saw in the streets,
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.560]   if she could.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.360]   This poor girl from Worcester will do well enough now.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.840]   There's nothing in this with her that rest won't mend.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.680]   We may yet have two birds here for this person.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.080]   - He's a brilliant actor.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.920]   - Of course, you can't.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.840]   - And really brings the books to life.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.680]   I became aware of him first when I was reading
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.320]   the Aubrey Matcher in series.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.480]   Now I think I have to do the whole Brother Cadfell series.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.960]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.040]   - Get the Patrick Tall version, absolutely,
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:24.880]   if you're gonna get it.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.240]   And you can get it for free right now.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.640]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.080]   Your first book is free.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.320]   And I think you're gonna become an Audible listener.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   I know we all are audible.com/macbreak.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.840]   Time for our, let's do the,
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.800]   let's do the adjacent tip first.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.640]   - Oh, right.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.920]   Well, you, I can do it.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.760]   Okay.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.600]   I can do it.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.920]   - Jason Stell, let me explain it to you.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.800]   - With a tip for us for iOS users.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.440]   - This is something that I actually wrote about.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.080]   I did a video of last week on mackerel.com.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.520]   You know, when you've got your iPhone, it'll chime.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.480]   You can set it to chime when you get an email.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.880]   - Yes.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.360]   - Which drives me crazy, by the way.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   Mine is randomly buzzing.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.520]   I don't want it to buzz anymore.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.360]   - And I get so much email that it doesn't really matter.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.200]   - Right.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.360]   - It doesn't help in any way.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.800]   So what I use is an app called BoxCar,
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.600]   which is, I think it's free,
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.320]   and then you can pay to turn the ads off on it for five bucks.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.360]   And what you do is you need an email client,
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.960]   or an email account that has a server side rule.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.400]   So Gmail will do this.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.840]   You basically go to Gmail,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.640]   you download BoxCar and you add a new email rule.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.680]   And what happens is it gives you like an email address
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.840]   that you have to send a message to.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.480]   And any message sent to this BoxCar email address
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.920]   will fire off a push notification to your iPhone.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.760]   - Ah.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.600]   - So what you have to do.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.960]   So you make a rule that will say, "You notify BoxCar."
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.320]   - And it's not quite so easy to do it in Gmail,
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.240]   as my video shows that we're looking at here.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.440]   You've got to verify.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.360]   So the first thing you do is you put it in Gmail,
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.080]   and it says, "I'm gonna send an email address
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.720]   "with a secret code."
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.200]   When you do that, though,
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.960]   that triggers off a push notification.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.080]   You get the secret code on your phone.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.680]   So then you enter that back in Gmail.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.600]   And once you've done that,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.640]   then your Gmail account,
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.760]   any filter can fire off a forwarded message
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.240]   to your BoxCar email address.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.920]   Once you've done that,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.520]   and you watch my video for the details,
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.160]   but basically it lets you say,
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.200]   if I get an email from my wife,
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.680]   or if I get an email from my mother,
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.240]   or this is when I actually have it,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.280]   if I get an email from somebody in Apple PR,
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.760]   - Right. (laughs)
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.000]   - Fire that off and make an alert sound on my phone,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.600]   so I know that I immediately
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.480]   that I got an email from that person.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.800]   So it's a little more discriminating, yes.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.760]   - Right, because I don't need to know
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.920]   every message that I get.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.440]   But I do need to know from three, four,
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.040]   five important people,
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.080]   or it could be important subjects,
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.440]   or priorities, or however you wanna do it.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.640]   But if you use your Gmail,
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.560]   or some other server-based rule,
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.640]   to forward those messages to BoxCar,
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.120]   BoxCar will then send you a push notification.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.000]   - Have you ever tried if this then that?
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.880]   - I tried it when I first saw about it,
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.600]   but I have to write it. - I think use the same way.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.320]   Well, not exactly the same way, it'd be different.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320]   It's free. - You can wire it up.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.200]   - IFTTT.com.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.280]   And what you would do is you'd say,
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.240]   send me a text message when I get a message from Apple PR.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.040]   - Right, and then it would do a text.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.880]   - It would do a text. - And BoxCar uses the Apple
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.320]   when you're doing a notification.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.040]   - So this would be another way to do something different,
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.400]   but similar idea. - Right, right.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.040]   - And the other thing, I also use BoxCar
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.360]   because it'll alert me for various other things,
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.040]   including it's got growl support.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.280]   So if you've got events happening on your Mac
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.880]   that you wanna push to your iPhone,
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.160]   it'll do that, which is,
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.760]   those are the moments where I stop
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.840]   and I'm kind of amazed about modern technology.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.840]   - It's pretty cool, everything talks to everybody.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.680]   - And downloaded Safari finished.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.240]   And my phone tells me it's done.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.480]   - And it says it's done. - And I can go back to the Mac.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.480]   - Files done. - So BoxCar, it's useful.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.240]   And certainly if you ever wanted email
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.080]   from specific people to fire off a push notification,
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   it can be done.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.600]   - BoxCar is really great, I actually use it too, I love it.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.560]   And it would be cool if we could get the files done
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560]   from AOL and you could have their phone say that too.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.880]   - I wish you could use custom sounds on it.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.120]   BoxCar's got some sounds, but you don't have access
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.840]   to all the custom sounds.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.680]   - Files done.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.640]   - Only AOL people are laughing at that one.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.480]   - You've got mail.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.800]   - You've got mail.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.560]   - What's his name, Derwood?
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.560]   - I'd say all the old Warcraft players will remember.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.200]   - Job's done.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.400]   Stop touching me.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.400]   - Stop it.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.920]   - All right, I hope that wasn't too cheesy,
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.040]   but that's my tip.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.080]   - No, that's a great tip.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.880]   BoxCar is a wonderful app.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.680]   Now it's time for Andy and Akko's Lion tip.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.880]   It is actually an iTunes match tip more than anything else.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.360]   You know, we need more of those actually,
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.000]   I'm glad to have that, yeah.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.760]   I was concerned that iTunes,
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.560]   I'm not locked into iTunes at all.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.080]   I rarely buy any music through the iTunes store.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.320]   And my concern was that they would add some cool features
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.520]   that would be so compelling that,
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.000]   dang it, now I really do have to buy all my stuff
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.040]   through iTunes as opposed to,
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.080]   I usually buy stuff through Amazon MP3.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.720]   But I was pleased to say that no matter how the music
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.920]   that you buy lands inside your iTunes library,
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.120]   iTunes match will automatically match it
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.680]   and add it to your iCloud.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.360]   So if you are using Google Music as your music locker,
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.880]   or if you're buying music through Amazon MP3
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.720]   and you're using their automatic downloader,
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.800]   it doesn't matter.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.760]   What will happen is that you'll make your album purchase
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.520]   or your track purchase through Amazon MP3,
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.080]   the downloader will automatically add it
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.800]   to your iTunes library, a magical event happens,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.400]   and iTunes simply will push the track information,
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.280]   it'll be matched by iTunes match.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.400]   And now the album that you bought from Amazon MP3
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.560]   will be available to you from the iTunes store
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.040]   through any device that you have
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.960]   that works with iTunes match.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.760]   And I think that's just wonderful.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.240]   Because I do prefer Amazon MP3
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.320]   because it's the most ecumenical.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.720]   The fact that I was buying all my music through Amazon
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.280]   was part of, I think, why I had such a great experience
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.920]   with the Kindle Fire.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.120]   You, just like Jason says, it's pre-registered for you,
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.760]   you take it out of the box, you turn it on, it says,
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.160]   "Oh, by the way, here are 89 albums.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.080]   "Would you like to play any of them, or none of them,
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:05.920]   "or all of them?"
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.760]   By all means.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.480]   Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't dock anything,
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.960]   don't select anything, I'll just play it for you automatically.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.240]   I saw, so given that right now there are multiple music stores
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.240]   that will each really sell you the exact same copy
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.600]   of the exact same digital file,
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600]   I'm still using Amazon MP3.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.960]   And the fact that now iTunes match will give me direct,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.960]   no sync streaming to my iPhone and my iPad,
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.720]   just means that this is why I'm spending 25 bucks a year
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.600]   for iTunes match and also why
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.480]   I can still have the freedom to choose whatever
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.440]   music store that I want.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   - Why do they charge, somebody asked this in the chat room
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.080]   earlier and I'd like to know if you guys know,
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.840]   why do they charge a yearly fee?
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.680]   Don't you just convert all your music and you're done?
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.320]   - Well, so. - It's good for next year, right?
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.800]   - Yeah, yeah, I wrote this.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.320]   I mean, do you keep the files forever?
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.360]   - Right, so we're done.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.880]   - But, since I've started using it,
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.320]   that was my initial reaction when I got announced,
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.760]   since I've started using it, I was like,
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.880]   "Oh, I see."
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.880]   Because it's the syncing stuff that makes you keep paying
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   $25 a year.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.280]   If all you wanna do is upgrade your files,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.240]   yeah, you can do it once.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.800]   But the syncing stuff is, I'm sitting in that airport
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   and I wanna play or I'm on my iPhone or my iPad.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.720]   - Oh, so that's not an iCloud feature, that's a--
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.760]   - That's an iTunes match feature.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.080]   - I've got it. - All the music syncing
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:11.920]   is an iTunes match.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.600]   - So that little puffy cloud showing up in my iTunes.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.440]   - That's iTunes match.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.640]   - I have to pay $25 bucks. - Right, right.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.240]   - So if you want the syncing and, you know,
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.880]   $25 a year, I was skeptical and now I'm thinking,
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.960]   yeah, they got me again.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.040]   - Especially if you've got you spent money on an air
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.520]   and you don't have all that room for the music.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.360]   - Yeah.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.240]   - I'm gonna add one more tip because there are some
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.840]   cuts that do not get converted.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.760]   You'll see in your iTunes an ineligible cloud,
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.720]   a cloud with a line through it.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.040]   And that happens if you've got a VBR recording
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.280]   and unfortunately most of my rib stuff is VBR.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.560]   - No, I've got lots of VBR and it's fine.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.920]   - It took it. - Low bit rate
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.520]   is a problem. - 96 kilobits or less,
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.720]   it won't take. - Right, all you have to do
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.200]   is convert it to AAC at a higher bit rate.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.520]   - That's the tip. - And then it'll upload
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.200]   and then it'll match and then you delete it.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.040]   - Then you delete the last-- - And you download it
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.960]   and you got it back.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.160]   - So Michael Rose wrote this in the unofficial Apple web blog.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.480]   He has an article on it, "How to Get It to Recognize Tracks
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.640]   "that it just don't like."
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:06.720]   Apparently he's got some MP2 files.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.720]   That's not gonna work.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.560]   - Hey, look at the link to Mackerel's thorough rundown.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.120]   I love that. - Yeah, that's 'cause you guys
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.400]   figured it out first. - That's me.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.000]   - We should pull it out.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.760]   So I shouldn't give him any credit.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.920]   - But no, his detail is fantastic about going through
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.560]   and re-ripping the files and then uploading them
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.080]   and then deleting them and downloading them
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.280]   and it totally works. - Yeah, I did it.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.880]   - And by the way, I do recommend the Mackerel thorough
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.520]   explanation of both iCloud and Match
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.360]   because it's not clear what's going on.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.000]   - It's the need you need this.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.320]   And Apple doesn't publish instructions.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.760]   - Apple has really done it.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.320]   iTunes Batch is a really interesting product
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.240]   and Apple has done a terrible job of explaining it.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.920]   - Yeah, that's perfect. - So into the breach step us.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.880]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   No, my upcoming Mackerel, our column is about this
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.280]   but it's rare to see Apple fumble so consistently
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.480]   over the past couple of months and just the simple
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.680]   active education where all they needed is,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.920]   you know, they got them guys in the black T-shirts.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.480]   They got one of them white backgrounds
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.880]   that could simply roll down behind them,
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.800]   have them make videos and explain how things work.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.120]   That benefits the users greatly.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.240]   And when guys like us are like on day one thinking,
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.560]   oh, is it streaming or is it downloading?
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:16.960]   I don't, it looks like it's downloading
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.400]   but it could be streaming.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.600]   What, how does this work?
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.680]   Oh, how come my smart playlist is it's there
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.320]   but this other one isn't there
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.120]   but the tracks are now not in the right order
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.200]   and why does it think that the all the E online podcast
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.280]   used the B-52s album art logo for, oh,
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.400]   I'm not very smart today, am I?
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.600]   - So this is this the tutorial,
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.560]   how to upgrade the tracks to iTunes match fast?
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.280]   - So that one you make, it shows you how
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.400]   to make a smart playlist.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.200]   - This is, Jason has a bunch of these guys here.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.280]   - Which identifies all your low bit rate tracks
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.200]   that are matched.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.920]   So they're not, they're ones that you know
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.400]   have been matched in the cloud.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.480]   But they still wanna, you still wanna delete them.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.800]   - So you make a smart playlist
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.280]   and then what you do is you hold down,
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.160]   I think it's the option key and hit delete
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   which forces all the tracks in the playlist
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.680]   to be deleted from your library
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:07.200]   and then you select them all and choose download
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.120]   and they all come back down which will take a while
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.640]   'cause it could be thousands of tracks
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.200]   and you might wanna, you know, read the article,
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.400]   you might wanna do it in stages
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.880]   but it really works.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.520]   You just find your low bit rate stuff,
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.640]   delete them, redownload them
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.440]   but only after they've matched.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.520]   Otherwise you'll lose your tracks.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.480]   - Smart playlist is clever way to do this.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.520]   - But again, you know, to Andy's point
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.200]   it is kind of amazing that Apple has come out with a product.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.240]   This is an online service that Apple sort of did write.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.000]   Some aspects of this technology are really cool.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:35.840]   - Right.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.680]   - And yet they're, they don't explain it at all to anybody.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.960]   It's, I mean, which again, it's great for those of us
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.400]   who are in the next world of explaining things.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.680]   But the fact that they're not out there
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.440]   beating the drum about it baffles me.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.280]   - Right, and the thing is it's not that it's a complicated thing.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.800]   It's just that you have to understand
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.680]   maybe four basic concepts that will inform
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.160]   every further understanding that you have.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   So one, again, one moderately attractive guy
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.040]   in a fitted t-shirt against a white background
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.560]   could have solved a lot of problems for a lot of people.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.240]   - So, you know, we were talking a little bit about it
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.600]   on, because we were talking about Google Music
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.280]   on Twitter this week with Cara Swisher
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.160]   and Kevin Rose and Mike Elgin.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.160]   And all of them agreed that this is moot
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.120]   because we just use Spotify.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.560]   And who cares?
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.160]   We no longer need cuts.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.320]   Steve Jobs is wrong.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.920]   People don't have to own it.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.640]   We're perfectly happy to pay 10 bucks a month,
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.320]   which is a lot more than match.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.000]   And just use Spotify.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:31.840]   No?
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.080]   - Not, not for me. - Not you.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.040]   - Because I, the, I can't predict
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.560]   what I'm gonna be using this album for
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.840]   in a month from now, six months from now, a year from now.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.320]   The fact that I was able to turn on that Kindle Fire
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.800]   and instantly have my entire library available to me
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.880]   without having to do anything,
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.200]   demonstrates why I was, or at least for me
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.480]   and the way that I play music,
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.760]   I was smart to have my music that way.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.160]   Without having to download Spotify,
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.360]   without having to wait for Spotify
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.600]   to become available for Apple TV
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.440]   or for the Boxy Box or whatever,
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.680]   I'm sorry, Spotify I think is already available for Boxy.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.080]   But that's the sort of questions I don't really have to answer
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.120]   if I have actual files that I can then put wherever I want.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.320]   So, it's a style.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.720]   - Yeah, it's a personal decision how you use music.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.160]   For me, it's always like paying rent versus paying for a mortgage.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.000]   - Right.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.600]   - If I spend five years on Spotify
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.560]   and at the end I decide to stop paying
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.040]   all the music that I've discovered
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040]   in the last five years has gone.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.640]   - I think it speaks to the commoditization of music
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.080]   alas in our day and age
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.840]   and that generations now,
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.680]   hey, if it disappears, big dealers and other Apple.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.880]   - And it's, well, that's, I think maybe that's always been true
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.640]   for some people and how they listen to music.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.440]   And I think for other people, they'll like both.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.720]   I actually think the perfect system.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:44.920]   And then this is why I'm surprised Apple
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.800]   hasn't done a subscription service.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.680]   Is for some people, I think the perfect system is
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.920]   you buy the stuff you really love
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.280]   and wanna hold onto forever.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.360]   But you also have one of these $10 a month subscription services
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.480]   to discover new music.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.400]   And in Pandora, which is not even $10 a month
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.960]   for the free version, you just press play,
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.520]   I can't tell you how much music I bought
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.360]   because of Pandora.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.200]   It's actually dangerous.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.800]   So I use Pandora to discover
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.520]   and I use Spotify or Rhapsody to discover.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.440]   And then the stuff I really like, I buy
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.320]   and then I know that I've just got that forever.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.680]   And maybe a younger person wouldn't feel that way,
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.120]   but that's the great thing.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.160]   I don't think it's an either or you can choose.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.160]   - Right.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.400]   Yeah, I use both.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.240]   I do use both.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.480]   And I've been doing music, iTunes match
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.040]   like crazy trying to get all those cuts.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.560]   And by the way, somebody asked in the chat room,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.080]   well, what happens after the year in iTunes match?
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.320]   Yeah, you keep that song.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.160]   - You can come files forever.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.000]   There's no DRM.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.920]   - No DRM, which is nice because one thing
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.720]   about iTunes match that's funny is
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.080]   you can only use it on five computers.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:39.920]   - Right.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.440]   But once you've done it, those songs now are capable,
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.760]   compatible with every other computer.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.120]   - Right, and that's the streaming
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.960]   that has to do with the streaming more than the files.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.720]   But it is sort of like amnesty for everybody
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.120]   who downloaded things on Napster.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:50.960]   - Beautiful thing.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.320]   And I'm converting all those 96-kilobit VBRs.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.840]   - I was gonna have to re-rip all my CDs
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.920]   and now I don't have to.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.480]   - So you did a VBRs or you did look quality?
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.800]   - Yeah, I did like 128s and then I went back
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.880]   and I did more at VBR, but they're still like 180 VBRs.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.280]   So even then the 256 AACs that are on Apple server
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.120]   are better.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.960]   - Yeah.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.800]   - Yeah.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.880]   - It forced me to dig out the huge hard drive
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.160]   that I had the backup of my master music library on.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.640]   And for the past year or two,
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.680]   I've actually just been listening to a subset
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.600]   that's just like the stuff I bought digitally
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.880]   and just the stuff that was maybe the gigabyte
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.960]   or two or three of albums,
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.320]   selections that were good enough to put on a notebook
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.160]   at some point.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.440]   This is not like my entire original 1000 CD collection.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.400]   And man, did it feel good when I dug out that hard drive,
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.880]   I added it to a brand new iTunes library
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.560]   that had never existed before on my desktop machine
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.080]   just for the purpose of introducing it to iTunes match
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:49.080]   and now having, oh, it turns out that Elvis Costello's
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.320]   Spike album has more than three tracks on it.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.600]   I forgot about that.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.000]   Interesting return of spikes.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.200]   - Yeah, you don't have to, I mean,
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.640]   I usually keep a version of your library, I think, around
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.720]   and not just trust in Apple,
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.520]   but I used to have a backup of it.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.600]   And I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.760]   I'm gonna have one local copy
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.640]   and then trust that Apple can be my backup.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.880]   - I've got hard drives all over the place.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.040]   - Full of MP3s.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.880]   - Yeah.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.800]   (laughing)
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.240]   - All over the place.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.600]   All right, we're gonna quickly run through our picks
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.920]   of the week and wrap this thing up.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.440]   Let's start with you, Andy Inaco.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.000]   Your pick of the week, sir.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.800]   - My pick of the week is a really cool journaling app
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.640]   called Day One.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.160]   And I think you can find it at dayoneapp.com.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.000]   - That's correct.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:35.840]   Oh, Andy. - Exactly.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.320]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.720]   Oftentimes you'll get like the idea of,
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.440]   oh, I should keep a journal, not just for my deepest,
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.560]   innermost thoughts and dreams, if I track them every day.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.680]   But also just the idea of, hey, I just had a baby,
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:52.200]   and I really wanna not lose all this information about,
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.240]   you know, what's happened with this,
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.840]   my kids life day after day after day.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.720]   And sometimes it's actually just a writing project
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.280]   where you just wanna write something every single day.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:02.840]   This is a really nice, it's almost like it's a word processor
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.240]   that is designed around the idea of writing something
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.120]   every day or writing something according to a calendar.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.040]   Because the central user interface is indeed
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.920]   what looks like a HIPAA version of ICal.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.960]   It's just a calendar that simply quietly tells you,
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.200]   oh, you've written something for this day,
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.480]   you haven't written something for that day.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.840]   And you can write pretty much good, rich text, long form.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.360]   An upcoming version according to the site
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.840]   will also include media, so you can add that to the mix.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.560]   So you can also have it remind you that you haven't added
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.680]   something to your journal today.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.920]   So please, maybe you wanna pay attention to that.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.120]   Not only that, but there's also iOS apps for it
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.200]   that will integrate very nicely together.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.560]   So while you're traveling, if you just have your iPhone,
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.920]   you haven't done anything today,
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.560]   and maybe you're not gonna sit down and write a thousand words
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.200]   about meeting George Lucas and him being so impressed
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.960]   with what you thought the flaws of Phantom Menace were,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.120]   but actually just, at least I can put in three sentences of,
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.240]   oh, well, I was, I kind of like was a little bit
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.640]   under the weather today, so instead of taking up the recycling,
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.880]   I just went to the coffee shop and read for two hours.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.080]   It's a cool inspirational app because every time,
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.600]   one of my favorite books that gets transferred
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.040]   in digital and audio formats to every device that I own
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.560]   are Michael Palin's diaries.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.360]   Two volumes that cover from 1970 all the way
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.720]   to the end of the '80s, where he's just incredible.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.520]   Every single day he sits down and writes a diary entry,
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.080]   and these are edited versions of it.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.360]   And you really do think about all of the information
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.920]   that gets lost, that of course, maybe you're gonna,
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.800]   you're gonna remember the day when your parents died,
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.040]   you're gonna remember the day that your kid was born,
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.120]   but maybe you'll lose so much information
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.400]   about the texture of that day,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.280]   and maybe the days that came before it and after it
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.880]   are also just as significant.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.920]   So I would really enjoy it if this helped me
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.320]   to get into that habit of, even if it's just two sentences
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:58.320]   that said, well, I started off my Kindle review yesterday,
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.160]   finally finished it today, but then I had a,
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.880]   I did the podcast, it was great, I got to talk to Jason,
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.000]   who I don't get to talk to as often as I would like,
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.760]   the it was on good form, and then I went out to dinner
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.880]   afterward, just that thing you never know,
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.520]   like two years from now or 20 years from now,
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.000]   how interesting that'll be.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.280]   So I think it's an interesting app to play with,
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.320]   it's 10 bucks from the App Store,
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.760]   but that's not a whole lot of money
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.480]   for a really well polished app.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.320]   - I keep thinking I wanna do a journal,
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.560]   I know I don't wanna lose these things,
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:28.400]   and I've downloaded a number of apps for that.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   This looks like the best though,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.560]   I mean, I'll have to download it.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.120]   It's a very, very pretty app too.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.400]   It's like, I'm so impressed with developers
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.200]   who not only have a good idea,
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.480]   but they execute in such a way that reminds me
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.360]   why I own a Mac instead of any other operating system,
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.280]   and this is a very, very Mac-like app.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.480]   - But no stitched leather, so I don't know.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.760]   I mean, I'll have to get used to that,
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:52.800]   I'm sure that if you add that to the bug fix report,
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.360]   they'll add that as a trackable item.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.380]   - Scumorphic interface, please!
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.520]   Good pick, day one, day one app.com for iOS
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.640]   as well as desktop, and now Jason Snell,
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.480]   your pick of the week.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.640]   - It's amazing, Andy and I didn't plan this.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.080]   - You're both writers, that's why.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.400]   - Yeah, we were writers, and it is National Novel Writing Month,
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.080]   as previously mentioned.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:12.920]   - RIMO.
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.720]   - 1,667 words a day.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.920]   - You've done this before.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.520]   - I've done this, this is my sixth year,
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.360]   I'm at about 32,000 words now.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.200]   - That's great.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.080]   - Yeah, I'm hoping to have it.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.720]   This time I'm hoping to actually publish it
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.560]   when I'm done as a--
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.200]   - What's the goal, 10,000 words in a month?
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.040]   - 50, 50.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.000]   - Yeah.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.320]   So I'm hoping that when I'm all said and done,
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.040]   I'll put something out there on Amazon and iBooks.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.640]   - The premise being that, even if what you're writing is junk,
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.960]   you only way to get good at writing is writing every day.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.040]   - Right, you need to write every day,
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.000]   you really shake the rust off,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.880]   that's setting a goal for yourself,
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.800]   like running a marathon or climbing a mountain,
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.400]   is something that you should do,
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.560]   and writing is hard, and so setting goals can help you do it,
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.000]   and I never, I always thought,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.640]   well someday maybe I'll write a novel,
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.680]   and I never, ever did it, and then six years ago,
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   I did NaNoWriMo, and 50,000 words later,
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   I had the start of a novel,
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.160]   and it ended up being like 120,000 words before I was done.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.360]   - My problem is always I sit down,
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.880]   and I just, everything, I can't write,
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.120]   I don't have anything to say.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.320]   I need a little--
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.920]   - Well, it's a challenge, so one prod
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.320]   is part of my pick of the week,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.120]   which is this website and Mac App and iPhone App
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.000]   called Write or Die.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.440]   - In fact, in fact they call it putting the prod
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.440]   in productivity.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440]   - Exactly, the idea here is that you can
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.120]   set a difficulty level, and you set a goal for yourself,
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.400]   and then it begins to make you angry,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.560]   and threaten you if you don't write,
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.800]   if you switch away, it'll start flashing,
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.960]   it'll make annoying signs, and in the ultimate evil mode,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.600]   it will begin deleting what you've already written,
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.520]   and you don't keep writing.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   - Oh my god, literally write or die.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.400]   - Yeah, as rods go, I think I love the idea
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.680]   to try to keep you going, keep you writing,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.240]   because getting those 2000 words in NaNoWriMo,
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.840]   boy, it's hard, and the internet is such an easy distraction.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.640]   I think one of my previous picks on this show
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.880]   was something called Freedom, which just turns off
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.480]   your internet so that you can write,
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.680]   instead of looking at the internet.
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:08.120]   Anyway, so that's a great pick,
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.480]   and then just more generally, and I know--
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.320]   - Andy's huge fan. - I'm sure Andy's
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.960]   talking about it at the script center,
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.560]   which is what I used to write all my long-form stuff.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.160]   - Now, lie incompatible, we like that.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.280]   - Yeah, it works great.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.480]   Andy uses it for a lot of stuff,
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.040]   I use it for all my long-form stuff.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.960]   It is, if there is only one long-form writing,
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.760]   creative writing tool you can use,
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.120]   I think it's Scrivener.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.120]   So it doesn't sync to the iPad,
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.840]   and that's one of these sources of frustration,
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:37.160]   but I've been toting my MacBook Air around all month,
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.280]   and using Scrivener to write my novel,
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.640]   and it's got an outliner and notes,
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.000]   it's got all these kind of integrated organizational tools,
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.200]   plus a good writing environment altogether,
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.320]   so instead of switching between an outlining app
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.080]   and a writing app and a brainstorming app,
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.880]   it all happens in Scrivener, and it's 45 bucks,
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.440]   and it's well worth it, I love it,
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.920]   it is one of the finds of the last 10 years, really.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.080]   - Not only that, it really is fine-tuned into the process
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.720]   of taking this enormous project
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.560]   that you cannot possibly get your head around.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.440]   I mean, Leo, you're absolutely right.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.800]   It's like, I wanna write a novel,
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.280]   but how do you write 130,000 words?
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.000]   Well, you don't, you start off with one index card
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.040]   with one idea for one scene that just came into your head,
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.680]   and then after about a week or two,
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.120]   you have kind of like an outline,
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.040]   and then you start saying,
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.640]   well, I really don't have it in me to write 120,000 word novel,
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.800]   so I'm just going to put into a document
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.520]   the way that I would describe this story
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.480]   if I was describing it to somebody.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.480]   Okay, well, it starts off at this lighthouse off a Cape Cod,
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.840]   it's kind of a rundown lighthouse,
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.680]   it's so rundown that's gonna be closed down,
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.320]   there's only one person who works there anymore
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.400]   'cause there are no ships that actually come into town,
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.800]   he just really sort of rents that,
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.560]   but then he actually finds this box,
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.880]   he realized that's not a chapter,
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.040]   but you are actually getting yourself to the story.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.000]   Scrivener will, without imposing any structure of its own,
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.280]   will help you to every, whatever you can do
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.540]   for this piece of work,
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.760]   whether it's a non-fiction book or fiction book,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.680]   it will help you get to that next step of it,
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.280]   and then one day you just sort of look at all the stuff
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.000]   you have and you realize that, wow,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.080]   it would only take me about a month to turn all this stuff,
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.640]   all these notes, all these photos that I've added
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.280]   to this for reference, all these maps from 1911 Boston
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.960]   that I've acquired because I did some research
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.040]   at the library into an actual publishable thing,
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.360]   I should do that now, so it really is,
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.280]   I cannot get, I often thought that I should have
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.920]   just to have a list of the five things
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.120]   that I think are the greatest things ever
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.240]   in the Mac App Store, and it would start off with,
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.720]   okay, obviously Scrivener, and then four more things.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.600]   - That's interesting, it's my memory
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   that Scrivener was written by a writer
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.320]   who taught himself to program
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.600]   so that he couldn't find the right tool, so he wrote it.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.680]   - And that's why it's good, is that he built the tool
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.520]   that he felt that he was a writer.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you can tell.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.760]   - There are a bunch of, and every time I recommend
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.600]   this app so publicly, there will always be a few people
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.560]   who quite correctly will point out that there are a bunch
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.040]   of open source and other apps that are kind of like Scrivener,
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.960]   but nothing executes this concept as well as Scrivener does.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:12.880]   - Keltex, we've talked about in some other similar things.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.480]   Quickly, we were almost that time,
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.280]   so I'm just gonna do a quick point out,
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.480]   not as much a recommendation.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.320]   I know Annie doesn't use Quicksilver.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.160]   Do you use Quicksilver?
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.000]   - I use Launch Bar.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.800]   - Launch Bar, okay, I'm a Quicksilver fanatic.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.360]   Unfortunately, the guy who wrote Quicksilver
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.080]   got a job with Google and he pretty much abandoned it.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.080]   The good news is it has been open source and recovered.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:34.920]   - Debandoned.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:37.040]   - Debandoned, and for a while,
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.680]   it wasn't working with Lion now, it does.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.560]   And so don't go to BlackTree, which is Alcor's website
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.200]   because he doesn't have the latest version.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.320]   The latest version is at qsapp.com.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.800]   It is still free.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.320]   I think, and this is a Merlin Man loves this.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.280]   It's a very, very capable free version
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.640]   of what Launch Bar, Arthur, and other apps do.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.720]   - Alfred. - Alfred, not.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.720]   I always get the A word.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.000]   - Right, it's the A word, but no.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.680]   - I like Alfred a lot, and I use Alfred,
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.680]   but I went back to Quicksilver once it worked with Lion.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.000]   - And if you're a Mac user who's skeptical,
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.360]   there's like, oh, keyboards, you know,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.560]   that's what's great about the Mac
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.800]   is that you don't have to use keyboards and all that.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.240]   You know, old keyboard command line stuff, trust me,
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.400]   there is nothing more productive,
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.040]   nothing that's a bigger productivity boost
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.080]   than any of these apps, because the idea that you can go
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.960]   tap, tap, and you're in an app instead of like,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.240]   I'll go to the finder, and I'll find, you know,
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.480]   and the applications folder, and I'll go in there.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.000]   You know, it's such a productivity boost.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.200]   It would be on my list, actually.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.920]   One of these tools would be a must,
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.760]   Scrivener, this, we're building a list now.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.880]   - Right, we are.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.600]   And you know, I know Dom Mac Alister's also
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.480]   a massive Launch Bar fanatic.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.000]   People who, what happens is you get used to one way of doing it
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.640]   and you customize the hell out of it
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.760]   and that's the one you're gonna use.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.520]   Andy doesn't like putting these things on his system
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.480]   because he says, but then what happens if I use somebody
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:48.600]   else's system and it doesn't have it,
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.040]   I've gotten dependent on it.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.960]   I don't mind, I'm dependent on Quicksilver
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.680]   and I think this is a great one.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.760]   It is free. - I'm free.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.480]   - QSapp.com is the place to go now
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.640]   to get the latest updates.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.760]   Alkor's passed on the torch.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.600]   - The pick?
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.600]   - The pick, so to speak.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.160]   Hey, thank you so much, Jason Snell,
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.720]   for making your way up the peninsula a little bit
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.120]   and joining us.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:10.960]   - Can be here.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:11.800]   - Always glad to have you.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.960]   - Nice place you got here.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.400]   - Pretty sweet, pretty sweet.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.480]   I'm pretty proud of what we did.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.360]   I mean, it's no Dan Benjamin, but I'm working on it.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.680]   I just realized both of you do shows for Dan.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.520]   - Yeah, well.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.840]   - I forgot about that.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.920]   Alex, I'm sorry, Mac, Jason Snell.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.760]   - Yes.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.600]   - Jason Snell.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.440]   Thank you.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.120]   Does a show called "Encomparable"?
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:34.960]   - Yes.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   - I like the name.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.760]   The incomparable.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.760]   You're talking about Darth Vader's office, apparently.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.760]   - Yeah, that's my son's line
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.320]   when watching "Empire Strikes Back" was,
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.040]   Darth Vader's office is really weird.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.440]   It's that like, clamshell thing.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.280]   - Weird.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.600]   - It's like sci-fi and books and movies and TV
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.600]   and geeky kind of cultural geek stuff.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.160]   - And if you're great, great cast.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.240]   - Not only is Jason on all the time,
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.560]   but he's got all the best people like John and Glenn
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.600]   Fleischman and Serenity Caldwell,
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.880]   Scott McNulty joining him.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.640]   So a great show to listen to.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.800]   - Occasionally Andy Anaco.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.840]   - And maybe Andy.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.280]   - I was on one, so I'd like to be on again.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.120]   - Yes.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.480]   - Andy'll be on every once in a while.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.960]   And Andy has a new, I see now Alex Lindsey
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.000]   has a show there too.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.520]   What are these guys, you, this guy, Jesus.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.320]   - We got a slot for you too, Leo.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.400]   - Yeah, yeah, maybe I should just kill the Twit
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.120]   and go to five by five.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.320]   - Is that Twit logo on the back of the wall?
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.800]   Is that like nailed in?
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.560]   Or can we hang like a five by five logo on top of it?
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.880]   - We should just put a five by five.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.200]   The Inocco Almanac, which is a great name for any show
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.280]   that Andy Anaco is involved with, Andy and Dan do this one.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.560]   - Unfortunately, they haven't started doing video yet,
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.840]   but it's just a matter of time.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.080]   - Well, I think Dan's studio is like a closet in Austin,
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.200]   Texas, so you may have the video up her hand there for a while.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   - God, nobody wants to see my podcast here.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.520]   - But they're well worth listening to, five by five.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   Somebody wrote me an email saying,
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.760]   "Why don't you keep plugging five by five?
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.800]   "You trying to get out and put yourself out of business?"
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.280]   No, because it's, we're all collegial.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.760]   - Because we're all here to unite
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.760]   against the common enemy.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.640]   - Whom whose name we will not mention
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.240]   because that would be promotion of the enemy.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.080]   - Exactly.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.720]   - The internet is big enough for all of us.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:09.800]   - Let's hope so.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.840]   - No, it isn't, not for the two of us in this other character.
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.840]   - Five by five dot TV.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.480]   - That's about killer sales.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.640]   - The he who shall not be named.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.840]   Hey, thank you both for being here.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.160]   Andy Anaco also writes for the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.520]   Macworld.com for Jason Snell.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.840]   Great pleasure, great cast.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.400]   Thank you for being here and we'll see you next time.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.240]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.880]   We do Mac Break Weekly every week

[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.280]   twit.tv/bestof because we are looking to collect
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.440]   great moments from this year's Mac Break Weekly
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.720]   for our holiday episode.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.920]   We'd like to give the cast a week off
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.000]   after Christmas, between Christmas and New Years,
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.040]   and that Tuesday we'll have a best of episode for you.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.840]   So help us make it if you would.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.040]   If you've got memories of a great moment,
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040]   just go to twit.tv/bestof,
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.720]   give us as much information as you can,
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.280]   and we'll turn that into a podcast by hook or by crook.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.720]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.600]   Now you better get back to work 'cause break time is over.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.920]   (upbeat music)
