[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to bash windows and love.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   Love your Mac.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.480]   I'm Leo LaPorte, and joining us today, Alex Lindsey
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.120]   Hello.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.120]   Good to have you aboard, as always.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.640]   Good to be back.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.240]   Scott Bourne from his fortress, his financial fortress,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.680]   up in Gig Haba.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.760]   Yeah, the fortress has had a couple of turrets taken out.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.240]   Oh, Scott.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.920]   Since you are one of the few who actually
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   are invested in the stock market,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160]   we have our deepest sympathy.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.120]   Do you think it's--
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   everybody's mad at me because I begin now every podcast
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.800]   with financial.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   But this is the big story, right?
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.400]   How much did Apple stock go down?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.360]   We're talking about Apple products,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.240]   and you can't talk about that without mentioning.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.920]   Something as tremendous as almost an 18% drop in the stock
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.000]   in a day or so.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Holy cow.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.960]   That's-- they're trading at around $100.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   I sold at $199, so we're roughly half
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.920]   where we were earlier about 8, 10 months ago.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   So it's significant.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.120]   I think you need to keep that in context.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.800]   The entire market took a 7% dump yesterday.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.360]   So why did Apple do worse?
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.320]   Well, I'll get to that.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.920]   The NASDAQ did a little worse than the Dow.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.160]   But about 9%.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.360]   And Apple particularly took a hit because of a report
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.240]   that they're not going to hit some earnings expectations
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.600]   on behalf of some of the analysts.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.040]   And also, I think, just remember we
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.760]   were talking a few weeks ago about how they had a couple
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.720]   of debacles, and they really couldn't stand anymore.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   And then yet, we had the iPhone charger problem.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   And I think these things all cumulatively
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   make people nervous.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.720]   But the earnings thing was the big deal on top of the worst
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.400]   stock market single-point day loss in history.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   So none of that stuff helps you have a good day.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000]   And according to the SEC, Apple granted $122 million
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.840]   in stock compensation to its executive team yesterday.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.040]   Isn't that nice?
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.560]   They won't vest till 2012.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160]   So they use these things to keep them in place, right?
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.920]   I mean, both.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.200]   If you talk to most people that know Apple well,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.360]   and you said whatever it takes to keep Steve Jobs,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.280]   they would have proved that.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.440]   The stock compensation is not just for--
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.680]   Actually, I don't even know if Jobs got an East Tim Cook,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.920]   got 200,000 shares, which would be worth $21 million.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.040]   That would keep me engaged.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.240]   Based on the closing price on Monday of $105,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.960]   so it's probably going to be worth more than that
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.320]   by 2012, the market comes back.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.480]   Well, I'd be shocked if it wasn't worth $225.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.640]   You're saying 10 times that?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   I think that the stock's going to rebound significantly.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   I always think that--
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.160]   But I think most of these stocks from the big companies
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.240]   are going to do well in the future.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   If you look at the history of the market in the '80s,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.680]   we had a 22% crash in one day.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.960]   And everybody thought the world was going to come to an end.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   And now the market's trading significantly higher than it was
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.800]   then.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.240]   The market goes in cycles.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.360]   And this is unfortunate in the context of this show.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.640]   If you're an Apple stockholder, it's also unfortunate.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.160]   If you're a developer or if you're a startup looking
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.360]   for cash right now, I'm working with a lot of startups
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.920]   that have great software, great ideas.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.080]   We're trying to raise cash.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.400]   And the doors are all closed.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.920]   Let me-- before we go too much further,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   I'm going to tell you some of the other shareholders,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.840]   or executives who got big grants.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.040]   Before we go too much further, let me welcome also
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.360]   Daniel Jiekut to the table.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.160]   Jiekut, I always say Jiekut.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   Jiekut to the table.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.360]   Hi, Daniel.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.860]   Hi, Leo.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.360]   How you doing?
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.960]   Daniel is the author--
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.760]   he's the guy in charge of Red Sweater software.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.640]   Mars Edit is one of the programs you acquired that from--
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.760]   who'd you get that from?
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.560]   From Newsgate.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.000]   Ranchero.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Ranchero, yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   Ranchero was acquired by Newsgate,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.360]   or the Newsgate spun off their Mars Edit to you.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.040]   That's right.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.320]   There we got it, straight.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.520]   And you've done other software as well, yes?
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.760]   Yeah, well, I've got some other stuff
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.960]   that I did myself, completely, an app called FlexTime,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.440]   is sort of a productivity app.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.920]   And now Merlin, I think, mentioned it
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   on the show previously.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   It's right.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   And then I have this crossword application, Black Ink,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.000]   which I was also very lucky to have Andy mention
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.960]   on the show previously.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   So I got tired of all you guys talking about me.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.560]   I thought I better just get on here and do some talking
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.080]   for myself.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.880]   It's good to have you.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   And we're going to kind of make this to the developer show.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.680]   We've been talking a lot about the experience
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.200]   developing for the App Store.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.000]   And I know that when you sign up for the App Store,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.680]   you have NDAs that you sign.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.920]   So we're not going to ask you to say anything, obviously,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.880]   that would violate your NDA.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.960]   But you have been fairly vocal about the Apple and the App Store.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   So we thought we'd get an actual developer on.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.160]   In fact, I'm hoping to get Austin Meyer on as well.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   He's having a little technical difficulty right now.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.200]   Austin is the creator of Xplane, which
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.280]   is an amazing FlightSim that is on almost every platform
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680]   and recently was ported to the iPhone.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.360]   He said it took him two weeks.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   So we'll Austin will join us if he can--
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.920]   he could port Xplane to the iPhone in two weeks,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.720]   but he can't get a microphone working in Skype
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.160]   as soon as he can he'll join us.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.400]   Let me just continue on.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.160]   So Tim Cook, we want him to stick around.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.520]   These are the people that we mentioned a couple of months
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.840]   ago when we were saying, what's going to happen if Steve Jobs
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.440]   has to retire.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.840]   Also with us, Austin Meyer.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.640]   He's here now from Xplane.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.880]   Austin is-- I've known Austin since the screensavers days.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   When we talked about Xplane on the screensavers,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.640]   just an amazing FlightSim that you've--
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.520]   now it's more than just you now doing it, right, Austin?
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.960]   I really can't take the credit anymore.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.520]   I started the whole thing out when
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.160]   I had a heck of a time passing some actual aviation currency
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   checks in the real airplane.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.880]   So I wanted to build a simulator for myself
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.680]   to keep my skills up on the computer.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.640]   And I started it by myself.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.680]   And I worked on it myself for, gosh, quite a few years,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.760]   probably up through version 7, I'd say, maybe around version 7
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   and 8, I started bringing more people on board.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.600]   And so we've got three artists now in Italy
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.280]   that do artwork for the simulator.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.800]   Well, that's me.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.360]   The Italian people, they just do the most wonderful, wonderful,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.240]   wonderful artwork for Xplane now.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.480]   And so when you look at all the amazing textures
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.360]   and terrains and clouds and lighting colors in Xplane,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.840]   those all come from my three Italian artists.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.000]   And then I've got a code consultant in Washington, DC
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.400]   who does all sorts of low-level nitty-gritty
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.760]   code-y type things, like how do you read a joystick,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.680]   or how do you initialize an internet connection,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.320]   or how do you initialize sound on Linux, or who knows what?
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.440]   Since Xplane runs on three operating systems,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.040]   there's all sorts of little nitty-gritty code bits
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.680]   of information that you have to have on hand
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.240]   to develop the technology out in these new directions.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.840]   So we've got a handful of people now, probably about five of us.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.960]   That's excellent.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.800]   And just ported it to Xplane to iPhone.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   You said in two weeks.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.560]   Well, something like that.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   It was two weeks without sleep working 16-hour days.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.040]   And that was the two of us just going absolutely nonstop.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.540]   So--
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.360]   OK, it wasn't that easy.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.640]   It wasn't maybe that easy, but it was two of us
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.440]   basically for going eating and sleeping for two weeks.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.760]   And what we did is we started with a basic iPhone application
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.520]   that Apple gives to developers that are going
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.840]   to get started on development.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.200]   And then we copied all these pieces of Xplane code
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.720]   into that sample.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.680]   And when we copied in the Xplane code,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.960]   we found out that if we copied only maybe 10% of the Xplane
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.920]   code into the iPhone, you could still
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   have like 90% of the fun.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.000]   So we managed to squeeze something as big and complex
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.640]   and powerful as Xplane into a small package as the iPhone.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.040]   Basically for two reasons.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.640]   One is iPhone is a pretty powerful little device.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   And two is it only with 10% of the code.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   You can still have 90% of the fun flying around.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.520]   I think that was one of the things that blue people away
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.280]   is that you can on a device that is--
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.960]   it's a phone.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.560]   Do a flight sim.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.840]   How powerful is that processor?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.600]   Well, I'm not allowed to talk about the exact details.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.400]   I've already gotten a mild little spanking for saying
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.800]   a few things I shouldn't have.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   So I can't go into details over exactly what
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.280]   the processors and whatnot are.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.800]   But what I can tell you is that the phone is so powerful.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.720]   It's just like the most incredible little platform
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.960]   for developers like me to come and make games and simulations
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   on.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.800]   You've been developing for Xplane for a long enough time.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.440]   Can you compare it to the power of a machine, a PC
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.880]   that maybe of five years ago?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.560]   Is it in that ballpark?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.000]   Well, I'm not sure exactly what specifics
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.640]   I'm supposed to go into, but I can tell you
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   that you're not far off.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.800]   Maybe a good way I could put it is to say Xplane
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.520]   is a good demo of the type of scenery, physics, fluidity,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.400]   and interface that the iPhone is capable of.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.200]   And when you see that, you can see
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.320]   that the future is really wide open for this device.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.240]   Oh, yeah, for gaming.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.480]   Because when you can do a three-dimensional virtual world
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.200]   racing around it with real physics at a high frame rate,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.560]   giving a fluid motion, what we're seeing now
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.160]   is really honestly just the tiniest little tip of the iceberg
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.520]   compared to what's to come.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.920]   I know we have Daniel Jockod on the line as well
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.960]   from Red Sweater Software.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.520]   You're doing iPhone development as well, aren't you, Daniel?
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.120]   Yes, I am.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   I don't want either of you to have to get spanked by Apple.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   So please do, as Austin did, if I ask you anything
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.240]   that you don't feel comfortable talking about,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.280]   what has the experience so far been like dealing with Apple?
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.120]   Can you talk about that?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.080]   I guess I'll jump in here.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.000]   I think it's pretty fair to say that the experience with Apple
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.200]   is sort of a crapshoot.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.600]   I mean, you can pick that up from the public's interpretation
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   of how applications are accepted or rejected,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.520]   even before the applications were being accepted,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   there was sort of uncertainty in the air about who
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.600]   would be accepted into the developer program.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.400]   And so this is not a great departure from Apple's age
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.640]   old reputation of being slightly less than the most
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.720]   conversant company in the world with its public or with its
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.280]   developers, I think.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:45.320]   But the big reward of the iPhone is, well, you have the iPhone
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.960]   device, which is so sexy, as Austin was saying.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.120]   It's a really impressive little device.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.440]   And you have all these customers out there who are excited to
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.160]   see such really awesome apps on the phone that it's kind of an
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.000]   unfortunate situation where we, as developers, are in a
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.520]   position to really accept what might be a substandard
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.320]   relationship in most contexts because the rewards of this
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.840]   platform are so great.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.080]   I think it's good that we can sort of--
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.160]   I feel comfortable being a dissenting voice about things
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.040]   that are going on without divulging anything that's private
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.240]   under my NDA with Apple.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.960]   I feel confident that I can do that and continue to receive
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   the same amount of support and cooperation from Apple that I
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:39.960]   have received.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.840]   Has that been the case so far?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.760]   Yeah, so far I am not keeping this spanking metaphor
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.840]   going.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.160]   My bottom is still lily white.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.480]   And you haven't been spanking--
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.480]   because you have in your blog.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.440]   You've talked quite a bit about the experience.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.400]   Yeah, I think since I left--
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.320]   I used to work at Apple and it gave me sort of--
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.600]   it increased my passion for the company, increased my love
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.800]   of the company.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.960]   And it also sort of, I think, gave me a little bit of that
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.840]   parental pride for the company where you don't really want to
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   let the company get off too easily.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.400]   So Apple fans have a reputation, the so-called fanboys,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.240]   of just giving Apple a free pass on a lot of things.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   And not with any ill will towards Apple,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.640]   do I try to keep them in my own analysis as
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.880]   honest as possible.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.480]   But I really think it's good for Apple.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.080]   It's like we're all out here calling them on imperfections
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.960]   and their behavior and their software in their way that they
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.360]   present themselves to the public.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   And I think ultimately that helps Apple to become a better
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.880]   company.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.440]   You agree, Austin?
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   Well, I may have a slightly different viewpoint than that.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.360]   What I am struck by is how incredibly hard working the
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.000]   company is and how incredibly focused they are on their
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.640]   message, their idea, their platform, their way of doing
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.360]   things.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   And I think maybe there's a certain natural fallout that
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.320]   says when they are focused like a laser on exactly what their
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.560]   target to be, maybe they don't need people coming in and
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.280]   maybe talking about the way things are being done.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.600]   Maybe they don't need people blogging on their own about
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.760]   maybe new ideas that are to come.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.840]   Because what they enjoy is just having an incredible product,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.400]   focusing it perfectly, and then unveiling it to the
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   public at just the right time.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.360]   And that kind of focus and energy and creativity, I think
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.240]   maybe to some degree that demands a little bit of a culture
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.840]   that says, let's not go scattering information out.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.720]   Well, that I understand, that I understand, Austin, but on
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.760]   the other hand, they seem to be a little bit mercurial and
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.040]   applique, what they pick to put out there, what they pull
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.600]   back.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.160]   If you're in Nul River, you've got to start feeling a little
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   gun shy.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.800]   Do you feel like, let me ask you a first, Austin, and I'll ask
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.160]   you Daniel, Apple is clear about what is verboten, what
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.920]   you can't develop?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.760]   There are certain rules about things that are going to cause
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.360]   you to be, let's say second guess as to whether or not it's
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.520]   actually going to make the story.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.800]   So Nul River should have known better?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.880]   No, hold on.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.720]   I don't know all the details behind that one.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.880]   So I can't say that.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.760]   But speaking for myself, I can say that Xplain has always
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   been an application that has a wide range of applications,
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.800]   a wide range of people.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.920]   I checked a bunch of boxes indicating that there's no
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.520]   violence, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.680]   And I didn't have any problem getting accepted.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.640]   Seems like Xplain to be a natural.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.360]   It is.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.440]   It really isn't natural.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.960]   I can't see any problem with--
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.560]   Apple's not in the flight sim business.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.960]   Daniel, do you feel like you know pretty--
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.920]   I mean, you're developing stuff as well for the iPhone, right?
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.320]   I am.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.960]   And here's the problem is I think none of us really knows
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.160]   how many apps are getting rejected from the store.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.080]   Unless the developer goes public.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.720]   And so we've seen a couple developers come public.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.000]   I'm sure there's at least a few more that have been rejected.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.240]   And there's no publicity surrounding them.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.440]   But I think it's probably safe to assume
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.560]   that something like 99.5% or something of these apps
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.920]   are getting accepted.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   And that sort of makes it a difficult scenario in which
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.200]   to have a kind of a real public protest about it,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.840]   except for on philosophical grounds.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.320]   So we can't discuss specifics about what is or isn't
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.240]   allowed or what Apple has conveyed to us is allowed in the store
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:41.740]   or not.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.040]   But I think it's pretty clear from the rejection
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.520]   of applications like Pull My Finger, for instance,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.760]   this fart noise application, right?
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.720]   Nobody's going to miss that.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.160]   Although you've got to wonder why that's not there
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.280]   in a bunch of flashlight apps are.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's like, OK.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.760]   Exactly.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.240]   And I think it's without, of course, revealing anything.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.040]   Let's just say that the official documentation about what
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.760]   is or isn't allowed may or may not contain the phrase fart
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.120]   noises, right?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.880]   In other words, you should kind of have an idea of what's
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.000]   allowed and what's not allowed.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.640]   So we'll move on from that one.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   Let me ask you another one.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.400]   And by the way, Alex and Scott, you
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.480]   don't have to sit back on this.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.320]   I want you to be involved here, too.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.120]   But the biggest criticism I've heard from developers,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.480]   developers who, by the way, I think
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.760]   are violating their NDA even to say this,
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.440]   is that the NDA keeps you from talking to other developers,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.880]   that the NDA keeps you from participating
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.120]   in what in a normal development cycle is very valuable,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.160]   which is that conversation about what works, what doesn't
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.960]   work, how you do things.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.200]   Do you find that a hardship, Daniel?
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   You know, not so much about whether it's a--
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.320]   it is definitely a hardship.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   And every developer who's working on the iPhone right now
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.120]   can probably recount anecdotes of hours and hours
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.760]   they spend--
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.280]   Reinventing the wheel, yeah.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.760]   Yeah, and it's just--
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.040]   it's not so much a hardship as a lack--
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.480]   it's the omission of a benefit that we enjoy so much
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.160]   on the Mac platform, which is this huge, helpful, friendly
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.120]   environment of developers.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.200]   I don't have a lot of professional experience outside
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.120]   of the Mac because I jumped right into the Mac
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   straight out of college.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.160]   But in my impression is very much
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.320]   that this sort of community around Mac developers
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.520]   is kind of unprecedented.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.080]   And we as Mac developers who have become so used to that,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.960]   we already have the infrastructure in place
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.520]   to discuss these things, to pool code.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.880]   We're generous with our code.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.920]   We give away code to other developers.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   We often try to even help our competitors
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.520]   because it just feels better.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.160]   And we have the situation with the iPhone
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.560]   where we're not able to do that.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.400]   And it's not so much whether it's
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.680]   hurting us or preventing us from developing great applications.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.000]   But whether these applications could be even better
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.040]   and whether the community could be stronger
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.080]   because if this was lifted.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   So this is a huge departure from what you normally have.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.760]   The normal rules, just for people who
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.080]   are listening who aren't developers,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.800]   normally you're able to share anything
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.600]   that you're working on when you're
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.120]   working on the Mac platform.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.080]   Pretty much to what you choose.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   There's not a--
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.000]   I guess the real question would be,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.600]   is it different on other platforms?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.520]   In other words, if you developed for a Microsoft Windows
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.680]   mobile platform, did they let you talk to other developers?
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.280]   I think in every case that I know of,
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.200]   that's how developers work.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.360]   Austin has slowed down.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.120]   Austin, has that been a problem for you?
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.920]   And furthermore, you don't get a lot of beta testing.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.120]   You were able to get X plane out.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.440]   Not only get it done in two weeks,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.240]   but did you do a lot of beta testing with it?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.400]   We didn't do quite as much testing as I would like.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.560]   We tested the heck out of it ourselves.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.800]   It worked pretty well right out of the box, I have to say.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.360]   Yeah, it worked a lot in the box.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.640]   We had a couple of things going for us.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.680]   One is that we took bits of code from X plane
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.240]   that have been very well tested over 15 years.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.400]   And another reason is that we were
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.840]   able to test right there on site.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.360]   And another reason it's been sub-naked,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.440]   one of the people in my company, the guy that does
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.200]   algorithms development, is just so unbelievably talented
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.480]   that we were able to really put all the pieces together
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.720]   in place in a really coherent way right off the bat.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   Right, right.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.240]   I just want to ask, I mean, does it, from particular
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.840]   to the developer's point of view, do you all think that it
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.840]   would help you or hurt you if Apple just threw the doors open
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   and said anybody can make anything for the iPhone?
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.320]   It would hurt me.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:41.840]   Really?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.160]   What I want competition for.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.000]   Here's what I want.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.280]   I want Apple to reject every single one from development,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:46.960]   except me.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.040]   And if I could just do that, I'd have to market--
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.600]   Well, they're not going to do that.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.080]   I'm going to have to work.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.400]   Bad news for you, Al.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:52.880]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.000]   I don't think that's going to happen, Oz.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.640]   Now that I'm inside, I want to keep everyone outside.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.800]   How can my nature say anything else?
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.440]   I mean, don't seriously, though.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.360]   I mean, don't you all see that there
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.520]   could be an advantage to--
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.680]   I mean, some applications being kept out
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.160]   if they were, for instance, applications that didn't work
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.280]   well with others?
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.840]   Well, I don't think there's any question
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.000]   that the more the doors are thrown open,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.720]   the more stuff is going to come in.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.320]   And the more stuff comes in, the more possibilities
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.400]   are for chaos.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.840]   Imagine programs that conflict with other programs,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.120]   programs that crash the phone and result in tech support
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.160]   calls to Apple, programs that cause the phone to break
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.080]   or do something untoward, where the customer then goes to Apple,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.440]   saying, I want my $9.99 back.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.800]   And now Apple is dragged down into refunds
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.640]   of tiny amounts of money because of disgruntled customers,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.880]   because of programs that came in from developers off the fly.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.840]   Programs that come in from some of this better
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.960]   than you think, because he's doing some around the backdoor
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.840]   with your data that nobody knows about.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.080]   I mean, the possibilities for chaos are so obvious
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.360]   that I can definitely understand the position of saying,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.960]   let's only have certain developers,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.120]   let's watch everything closely and let's not have
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.920]   the wrong people finding out how to do certain things.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.080]   I know that I know for me, I was excited about having a good,
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.880]   I live here in San Francisco and I was excited about having
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.160]   a good BART schedule that I didn't have to go to the web for.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.560]   Something that would just sit on my iPhone
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.040]   and download a two that just turned out to be maps,
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.880]   essentially.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   And paid not a $1.99 for them, but it was like $7.99.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.360]   $1.99 or whatever.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.600]   And I was experimenting and I was willing to do it,
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.120]   but I was really chaved by the whole thing.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.600]   And I literally thought, I'm just going to wait
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.040]   for another month or two before I even try to buy
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.840]   another application because I just want to let everything
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.640]   mature because I was in that.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.560]   So it stopped someone who, I mean, I buy way more than I should,
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.440]   but it literally stopped me in my tracks
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.040]   and I stopped buying anything and just decided
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.400]   I'm just going to wait this one out for a while.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.080]   - Well, there's something worse coming down the pipe,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.880]   which is the T-Mobile G1 and the Android phone.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.520]   These are going to be open, this is going to be an open
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.760]   platform, T-Mobile is going to have an App Store.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.600]   I think what you're going to see is a very interesting,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.200]   this is where the market's going to decide.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   You have the kind of linear, beautiful, elegant experience
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.520]   of the iTunes App Store and the iPhone,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.120]   but a closed platform versus a wide open, wild West.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.920]   I think Android's going to be a wild West
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.520]   because it's basically open for this platform.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.160]   I think it may be that different users
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.280]   will prefer one or the other.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.040]   I'm excited about the idea of an open platform.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.960]   I ordered a G1 immediately because I like the idea
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.600]   of adding Apple to app, add any apps.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.920]   As a developer, are you looking at the G1 platform
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.080]   or the Android platform?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.440]   - I'm not really, but I'm just such an incredibly die hard
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.560]   Apple fan that I'm just all excited about the iPhone
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.480]   and the Apple marketing and branding and the ability
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.960]   to push a button on a computer, upload something
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.360]   and have everybody be able to run it
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.200]   on the coolest phone I can imagine.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.120]   So I'm sure I've got all sorts of loyalty,
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   brand loyalty prejudice, who knows what.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.160]   But at this point, I've gotten a lot of emails
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.320]   from a lot of customers asking if I can run
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.080]   on basically every phone under the sun.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.520]   - Yeah, we'd love to see it on an HTC drink.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.360]   That'd be great.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.760]   - Of course, but then the question becomes,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.280]   how many times do I have to reinvent the wheel?
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.720]   I mean, the same question has been asked,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.960]   oh, well, don't you want to support Sony PS3 or Xbox 360?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.320]   And at some point, I have to ask, wait a minute,
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.160]   I can reinvent the same wheel eight times on eight platforms
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.880]   or I can come out with a new product
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.360]   or a new improvement to explain and just tell people,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.320]   hey, get an iPhone or a desktop computer to enjoy it.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.520]   No, you're not going to be running this one
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   on your Xbox 360.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.600]   You're going to have to go on ahead
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.720]   and get a nice drink out, PC Mac or Linux box.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.680]   So maybe to some point, I'm being lazy
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.760]   and offloading a certain amount of work to my customers
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.200]   by saying, hey, get the platform that I support
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.720]   rather than let me try and support every single platform.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.400]   But when you run an iPhone and Macintosh and Windows
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   and Linux, I think it's a pretty decent support,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.120]   you know, infrastructure.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.200]   - Yeah, it's interesting that you would develop
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.320]   for Windows, but not Android.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.920]   - Well, that may change, okay, in the future.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.640]   It's just not where we've been guided so far.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.360]   - Right, right.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.000]   See, I'm going to be very, very interested
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.320]   to see how Android does,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.280]   'cause that's going to put the screws to Apple
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.600]   in the same way that the Amazon MP3 store,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.360]   which by the way, will be on the G1,
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.120]   is putting the screws to iTunes.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.080]   And by the way, I think iTunes still completely dominates.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.880]   So at least in the buying music space,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.240]   the Scott Barnes of the World are winning.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   - I'll wait a minute now.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.080]   (both laughing)
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.760]   I'm not, listen, I'm not against open platforms at all.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.960]   I'm just against freefrawls.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.040]   There's a difference.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.880]   - Right, right.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.280]   - And, you know, I've had too many
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.640]   of those terrible experiences buying these cell phones
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.280]   that are open, and I can't get anything to work.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.880]   The one thing I'll say about my iPhone
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.400]   is it's worked consistently since the day I got it.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.800]   And, you know, I think that the notion
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.360]   that there'll be some sort of developer revolt
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.400]   is frankly just, you know, it's crazy.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.600]   There's just too big a marketplace here.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.440]   Now, I did note that Apple took a couple of steps
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   in the last couple of days to try to do better.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.600]   I think they're listening.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.680]   I frankly think they've just been overwhelmed.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.520]   - I think you're right.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   - I don't think they choose to make it this draconian.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.520]   I wouldn't imagine.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.080]   - They've made it so now that, for instance,
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   developers can't just comment on other developers' products
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.240]   that, you know, real people buying stuff
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.880]   have to leave comments.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.520]   And they've made a few changes.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   And I think they're listening.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.440]   I don't think they really had any idea
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.280]   that this many people would be this interested, this fast.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.360]   And if I were them, the really loud complaints
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.760]   from the 1% wouldn't scare me.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.880]   I would listen to them and see if there's anything
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.720]   that's meaty there.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.680]   And I think they are listening.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.040]   But I don't see that there's gonna be any kind of revolt
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   over a couple of denied apps.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.440]   All that's gonna do is create holes for other people
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.240]   that are willing to go in and make stuff
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.320]   that's gonna work.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.720]   And obviously, you know, we can argue about
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.960]   whether or not they should limit farting.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.880]   Personally, I'm not gonna pay money to fart.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.920]   I can fart for free.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.900]   - But those who want to, like my son,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.360]   why shouldn't they be able to buy pull my finger on the iPhone?
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.800]   - Well, and I think the argument you also get into is you have,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.660]   they're saying, well, where do you draw the line?
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.600]   Because you can't fart,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.320]   but you can download an application
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.800]   where you're popping shipping bubbles.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.640]   - Right.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.160]   - Which is, by the way, a lot of fun.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.000]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.760]   - I actually own bubble wrap up.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.680]   - Oh man, it's great.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.520]   - But I see that we get into the bigger discussion.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   Well, I happen to think maybe that you should be able
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.160]   to download the new Playboy.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   Well, I think they do.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:29.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.360]   - I think so too, and I'm not sure why they would eliminate that.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.200]   - Yeah.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.360]   - Well, I think the problems--
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.200]   - Well, I think the problem--
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.040]   - In case you're listening, I would like to download
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.880]   the new Playboy.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.720]   - Go ahead, Daniel.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.680]   - I think the problem is, it's not so much a draconian
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.880]   situation as it is just kind of a haphazard crapshoot.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.800]   So, I mean, when you see so many applications
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   of such a wide and frankly low standard overall,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   the average quality of an iPhone app
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.680]   is I think pretty low standard.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.520]   So it sort of sets you up with this expectation
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.560]   that almost anything will be accepted to the iPhone app store.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.320]   So then if you end up being that 1%
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   who does get rejected or whatever it is,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.280]   Scott says it's this loud minority that's 100%,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.480]   but as Apple fans, what we have to worry about
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.760]   is how this loud 1% ends up percolating up
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.040]   into the mainstream press.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.120]   It gives Apple a black eye,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.600]   it helps it to grades Apple's public image.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.320]   I know they have a lot of sort of public image credit to spend.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.880]   So it's really difficult to outright turn
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.680]   the public's view against them,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.480]   but I think on the flip side of that,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.120]   their self knowledge, self awareness of their popularity
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.200]   also sort of makes them a little arrogant
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.800]   and maybe they don't take as seriously
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.840]   some of the loud 1% complaints as they should.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.320]   - I mean, I think the one thing that I think
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.480]   when I see all of this stuff is that number one,
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.520]   Apple listened to people by making the app store available.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.880]   When they released it, it didn't seem like
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   they had any intention of doing that.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.360]   And that's a very good point.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.240]   I was one of the loudest complainers.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.400]   That's an excellent point.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.320]   - They put it out.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   They-- - Now complaining again.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.960]   (laughing)
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.560]   - Yeah, they can't win, but I think the other issue is
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.320]   is that I think Apple was probably more lenient
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   at the beginning to make sure that there were enough
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.080]   applications in the app store that you go up there
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.240]   and you'd find lots of different things,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.560]   but I'm guessing they're gonna start tightening
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.280]   a little bit more and becoming a little bit more
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.000]   exacting about what that is.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.360]   I mean, I think that it's a new area.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.920]   They're figuring it out.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.600]   I personally would like them to tighten it up
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.680]   or at least make sure that,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.160]   I mean, I think that partially it's just better review sites,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.000]   better review.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.880]   We're working on some review stuff related to it
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.440]   because one of the big issues is just being able
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   to see through all of the feedback on iTunes
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.120]   is kind of worthless for both podcasts and apps.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.440]   So it's just you can't really get real information,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.560]   you know, from that and improving that would help.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.000]   But I just know that I've downloaded,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.840]   I probably spent $50 on apps that I don't even think
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.680]   about using anymore.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.720]   And I've spent more on apps that I think are just fantastic.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.280]   You know, so I think that it goes both ways,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.800]   but I am getting a little tired of experimenting.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.200]   - You know, I mean, I'm ready for this.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.320]   This is the battle that's going to really rage.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.280]   Adobe apparently is nearly done with flash player
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.320]   for the iPhone.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.640]   Senior Director of Engineering at Adobe Systems,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.560]   Paul Betlam was speaking at a conference,
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.040]   asked for an update.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.560]   He said his team is working on flash on the iPhone.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.800]   They've been working for three months.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.840]   And apparently Apple is waiting on Apple approval.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.440]   He says, "Should Apple approve the software?
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.000]   "It would be available in a very short time."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.880]   So there's going to be, you know,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.440]   Apple said for, I think Steve's been very clear,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.880]   he doesn't want flash on the iPhone.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.240]   Adobe's gone forged ahead.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.560]   Here you're going to have a kind of a head to head clash
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   between two big titans and a lot of consumers,
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.680]   including our audience,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   who would love to watch Twit Live on the iPhone.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.080]   - I think a lot of this comes down to Apple's resistance
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.040]   to having another Microsoft that they have to deal with,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.360]   which in what I mean by that is that
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.080]   Apple really doesn't want a proprietary codec.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.600]   They don't want to have to deal with another,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.120]   like if Office left the app.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   When Steve came in, if Office had left Apple in 1997,
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.640]   Apple would have failed.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.120]   - You mean, that's the issue that they were up against.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.640]   And I think that there's an entrenched resistance
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.760]   to ever happening, what they want is something more open
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.920]   or something they control.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   You know, I think those are the,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.600]   and they've tried to push forward SVG.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.360]   They've tried to push forward other things that aren't
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.520]   as as successful as flash.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.480]   And aren't as good as flash.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.040]   So I think that's the problem,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   is that there's not a good solution other than flash
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.680]   to do a lot of the next generation web experience.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.160]   But Apple's trying to do that.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.440]   I think Apple's trying to make a lot of other tools
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.680]   available and at the same time,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.760]   trying to kind of hold flash off
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.640]   and not give it another platform to expand on.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.400]   - I want to mention real briefly before we go on,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.880]   and we will go on in a minute,
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.160]   talk more about the Mac news.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.400]   I didn't finish giving all the dollar amounts
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.680]   for the executives we could talk about.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.320]   We could find out who Apple thinks should stick around
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.560]   in just a little bit.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.400]   But before we do that,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.560]   I want to mention our friends at Drobo.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   Drobo sponsors this show.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.520]   They make the intelligent automated storage device
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.840]   for your digital storage needs.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.280]   I got a new Drobo in the office.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.560]   After my crash of last week on the website,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.760]   I've decided to Drobo ties everything.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.160]   Drobo combines up to four hard drives
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.480]   into a single enclosure,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.160]   accessible right from your desktop.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.040]   Now, there are two flavors of Drobo,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.680]   the original Drobo, which is USB 2.0.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.520]   And the new second generation Drobo,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.280]   that comes with Firewire 800
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.040]   for you lucky Mac folks who have Firewire 800,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.960]   as well as USB 2.0.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.440]   It's twice as fast.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.320]   And of course, it's a little bit better
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.440]   because it's a little bit newer.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.520]   And I think you're going to want it.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.640]   But if you don't,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.440]   you could save a lot of money on the original Drobo.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.680]   We actually got the original Drobo
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.480]   because we're moving it around from machine to machine.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.920]   And I want to deal with not having Firewire 800
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.680]   or not even having Firewire on some of these machines.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.720]   So we're going to continue to use USB for compatibility.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.080]   Right now you get 25 bucks off either.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.120]   $25 off the new second generation Drobo
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.480]   with Firewire 800 and USB 2.0 or $25
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.360]   off the original Drobo at a reduced price.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.640]   This offers good through the end of the month,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.200]   October 31st, 2008.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   So hurry, hurry, hurry to Drobo.com/MacBakeBreak.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   DROBO.com/MacBreakScott.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.040]   I understand now from the Drobo folks that the focus,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   one of their focuses is they were at Photokino, weren't they?
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.080]   Is on photographers because like the new 5D,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.720]   which I'm not going to rub this in your face Scott,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.960]   but the new 5D, I think that it must be true with the 3D,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.280]   the image is like 22 megapixels, 23 megapixels.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.520]   No, it was more than that.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.200]   - First of all, no need to rub it in my face.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.520]   If I wanted one, I'd just buy one.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.360]   - That's true.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.320]   (laughing)
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.240]   - And you're going to want one.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.640]   I have to tell you, I think you're going to want one,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.960]   but we'll talk about that a little later on.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.640]   - For wildlife photography, it ain't right,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.560]   but we'll talk about it later.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.640]   - Okay, I understand that.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.600]   - You're right, they are targeting photographers.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.760]   They're going to be at Photo East in New York
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.520]   and they've worked a lot with Alex and I on Twitch.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.200]   They recognize that photographers have a really big problem
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   that is most photographers do not have adequate backups
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.040]   of their images.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   And I know many photographers who've contacted me
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.880]   and said, "Oh no, I lost everything."
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.160]   If you're probitized, that's almost impossible.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.960]   With 25 megapixels, megabyte files now coming out
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.080]   of these cameras.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   - Oh yeah, pretty soon we're going to have
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.480]   point and shoots with terabyte sizing.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.320]   (laughing)
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.160]   - You're right.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.480]   So you need the storage.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.120]   Good news though, the hard drive manufacturers
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.480]   are keeping up, so you can get up to 16 terabytes.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.080]   As soon as they come out with four terabyte drives anyway.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.920]   In your grower.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.880]   - Yeah, well the 1.5 terabyte drives are shipping in January.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.640]   - That'll be awesome, six terabytes.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.480]   - And if we've done it. - I have mine ordered.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.320]   - It's redundant.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.040]   - We're filming, we fill up ours with generally,
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.160]   the one terabyte drives have now gotten down to $129.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.320]   - I can't believe it, I know.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.160]   I'm using 750s now, yeah.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   - Yeah, I mean you can throw four terabytes in
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.440]   which will give you about 2.7 to three terabytes
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.760]   of storage into a single-drub.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.120]   I mean we still have a lot of the USB ones
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.200]   because we're not using it for online storage,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.800]   we're using them to back up large amounts of data.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.040]   And for that it works exceptionally well.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.200]   And if you're using it for more online,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.080]   that's when the Firewire becomes more important.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.160]   - Drobo.com/MacBreak, we thank them so much
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.600]   for their support.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.280]   So I'll have to listen to a trip photo
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.240]   to get your comments on the Mark II, the 5D Mark II, Scott.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.080]   - Yeah.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.160]   - But just off the top of your head,
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.680]   is it 'cause the frame rate isn't fast,
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.520]   is that why Wild--
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.880]   - Yeah, it's five frames a second instead of nine.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.000]   It's nine focusing points instead of 52.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.400]   It's a great camera for a lot of things,
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.160]   but wildlife and sports photography
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.480]   would not be two of them.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.680]   - Alex and I are very excited about the 1080p video.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   - I'm buying one.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.400]   - Well I'm probably gonna buy one just so you know,
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   just because I want it to be my video camera
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   'cause my little buddy Alex says it's gonna be a good one.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.600]   I can't wait.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.040]   - It looks like I'm gonna be going to Japan
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.160]   for a couple of weeks in December for a shoot.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.200]   And I just didn't wanna take two cameras.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.560]   I don't wanna take another little camera,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.880]   I just want one camera that I can shoot behind the scenes
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.720]   of what we're working on
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.160]   and then be able to just flip up the video
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.600]   and shoot great looking video at the same time.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.320]   In other words, you only wanna lose one camera per trip.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.840]   - That's what I like.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.240]   I like to keep it as a limit.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.120]   You know, the stock market has a 10% limit.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.800]   I have a one camera limit.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.080]   - You know, it's just out of there.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.720]   - I'm keeping the old 5D body.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.160]   I have a backup, which is a good thing to have.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.600]   - But you got lots of nice lenses too, Leo.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.160]   - Well that's the thing and you know,
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.680]   I'm really happy 'cause combining those lenses
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.800]   with the 1080p video.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.200]   And you know, five frames a second,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.840]   that's really enough for me.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   - It's absolutely enough for most people.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.480]   - And I, and Frank, now, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   what do you need 52 focus points?
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.720]   I set the focus, I only use one focus point.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.760]   I've, 'cause I wanna focus on the thing I'm focusing on.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.600]   - Yeah, well, you see, there's this thing called composition.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.920]   (laughing)
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.760]   Sometimes you don't--
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.000]   - Only one thing's gonna be in focus.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.640]   Well no, but Scott, come on.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.800]   I focus on the thing I'm gonna focus on,
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   then I recompose the photo.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.680]   - Well you and I need to go on.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   - Isn't that a better way to work?
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.520]   - Why would you-- - You're not using
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.800]   the auto focus, are you?
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.160]   - So here's what we need to do.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   You and I need to go out and photograph fast flying birds
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.600]   together. - Well I see what you're saying.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.200]   - And you just let me know how that works out for you.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   - I see what you're saying.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.240]   You're right, okay.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.440]   So the birds moving, you gotta trust the camera
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.040]   to do the right focus.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.920]   - Yeah, we're not talking about taking a picture
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.960]   of Kwait Tower in San Francisco,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.680]   which hasn't moved 200 years.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.720]   - Well even a human being you can focus on,
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.360]   but if the bird is flying, I get it.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.240]   - That makes sense, or blue angels.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.360]   If you're shooting the blue angels,
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.200]   then you wouldn't be.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.240]   - Like I say, I'm gonna buy one
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.560]   strictly as a video camera.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.560]   - Right, yeah.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.880]   - I'm gonna throw a 50 millimeter,
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.720]   one more four four four.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.560]   - You still look good though.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.840]   I'm seeing some stills now.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.520]   - I guarantee you, this is going to be a fantastic camera
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.800]   for most people that are,
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.960]   if you're a cannon shooter,
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.480]   you're gonna love this camera.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.400]   But we also have to factor in that,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.240]   you know, we haven't touched and seen it yet.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.600]   I was equally excited when Canon released the 1D Mark III,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.680]   'cause I had been the owner of a 1D Mark I
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.360]   and a 1D Mark II,
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.960]   and then when the 1D Mark III shipped
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.160]   with poor autofocus, I got a lot less excited.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   - Yeah, you don't know what'll happen.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.480]   You gotta get it in your hands.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.720]   We talked to Vincent LaFlore
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.440]   over the weekend and he seemed very low.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.000]   He's flipping, he loves it.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   - Well, now you know, he gets paid to say it.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.240]   - I know, he works for Canon.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.080]   But, he doesn't work for Canon.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.640]   - He's an explorer of light.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.560]   - Yeah, he's a Canon guy.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.480]   But he had it for the weekend
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.080]   and you saw the video, the movie.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.400]   - It was incredible.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.720]   - It was unbelievable.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.080]   - And you know what?
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.280]   If I thought I could shoot video as well
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.160]   'cause he was a camera.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.000]   I wouldn't even wake up.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.840]   - Give us.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.680]   - He started shipping him.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.520]   I go to Japan, get one day.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.200]   - Yeah, no kidding, no kidding.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.520]   So let's see, Tim Cook,
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.360]   we were talking a couple of months ago
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.480]   about who would take over Apple should Steve Jobs get ill,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.360]   who should he step down?
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.000]   And by the way, of course, as he said at the last speech,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.600]   the rumors of his death are greatly exaggerated.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.440]   But it's always good to have a backup plan, a plan B.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.360]   Tim Cook got 200,000 shares worth 21 million on Monday.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.920]   Scott says 10 times that by 2012 what he can invest.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.960]   Ron Johnson is a senior vice president of retail.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.200]   Peter Oppenheimer, we hear him on the analyst calls.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.680]   He's this chief financial officer.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.240]   They both got 15 million.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.120]   Senior vice president,
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.920]   worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller,
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.480]   I'd give Phil some money.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.040]   He only got 12 million though.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.080]   Bertrand Cerlais, who is the senior vice president
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.520]   of software engineering.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.760]   Senior vice president,
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.200]   Mac Hardware Engineering, Bob Mansfield.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.800]   Jonathan Ive, the industrial design guy.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.720]   And iPhone software vice president Scott Forstall,
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.080]   he's the guy that they put in after the mobile me fiasco,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.420]   right?
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.140]   Got all got 120,000 shares worth 12 million.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.560]   Not so bad.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.460]   - I would take it.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.200]   - I'd take it, wouldn't turn it down.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.400]   You don't vest for three years, but that's okay.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.600]   You could stick around.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.120]   - Now those are similar to the numbers
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.400]   that those of us in the Twitcast are gonna get from a...
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.400]   - Yes.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   - Someday I'll vest you in the year 25, 25, if man is still alive,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.680]   if woman can survive, you will vest Twitstock.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.840]   That's my promise to you all.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.960]   - I think one thing when we look at the stock prices
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.360]   for Apple that we have to remember is that they have $18 billion
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.040]   in the bank.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.840]   You know, so it's not like they're looking for,
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.200]   they're not part of the credit crunch, so to speak.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.960]   - That's a very good point.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.560]   - In fact, I think sooner or later,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   the government might have to come to Apple and borrow money.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.920]   - So what you're saying is when we discover
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   who the Washington Mutual of the computer industry
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.160]   are Apple's gonna be there to...
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.760]   - Yeah, who are the Wacovias and the Washington Mutual
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.840]   of the technology world?
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.160]   Who is gonna fold?
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.000]   - Well, there's a lot of, I mean, one of the things about,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.160]   I was talking to someone yesterday about a publisher
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   about the fragile nature of the credit crunch
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.480]   and how it affects everyone.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.080]   And one of the things they pointed out is that,
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.240]   let's say a book company, you know,
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.880]   like Borders or Barnes and Noble or something like that,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.200]   needs credit and they can't get it
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.640]   and they have to shutter their doors.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.600]   Well, that means a certain number of publishers will shutter.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.320]   A certain number of paper companies will shutter
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.240]   a certain number of...
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.080]   - Goes down the line.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   - So it flushes down real quick
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.280]   if people can't get their credit.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.440]   - Right.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.600]   - Saul Hansel writing in the New York Times has some questions
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.320]   Apple needs to answer in this crisis.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.680]   He says, "One issue is gonna be sales for the holiday season.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.600]   How will a premium price product like the Apple line
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.480]   hold up when times are tough?
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.040]   Will people turn to, you know, sand disc,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.240]   sandes and PC clones?
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.520]   Or will they still pay the money for a Mac?"
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.280]   - I was thinking about this and it sort of occurred
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.800]   'cause, you know, I'm in the software business
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   so I'm selling my...
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.960]   - You have to think about it too, yeah.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.040]   - Yeah, I'm selling my $30 apps and I'm thinking,
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.200]   well, what's gonna happen here?
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.160]   Are my customers all gonna go broke
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.880]   and, you know, put me out of business?
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.600]   And then I started to think, you know,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.760]   people like to spend money even when they don't have,
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.120]   you know, quite as much as they used to.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.000]   So I think the real question to ask is,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.640]   you know, come Christmas time when people are trying to
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.600]   indulge themselves and indulge their families
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.600]   and expensive gifts, do they maybe put off getting a new,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:59.880]   you know, HP desktop computer and a new Apple Macintosh
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.720]   computer, but then maybe they compromise and they buy,
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   you know, a sexy $200 iPod.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.080]   - I think you're right.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.920]   I think you're right.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.760]   Apple didn't drop the prices.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.360]   Apple knew this was coming.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.080]   They didn't drop the prices.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.720]   Scott, isn't it true that in a recession,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.480]   things like make up little gifts to yourself do better?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.120]   I see you remember that.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.400]   - Yeah, there are certain things that are sort of
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.240]   recession-proof wedding photography, for instance.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.160]   - Yeah, you're gonna have a wedding.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.560]   You gotta have pictures.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.400]   - And, you know, things like that.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.040]   But, you know, technically, and this is just,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.840]   I grant you technically we're not in a recession.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.520]   Certain, certain, you know, formulas have to be hit
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.360]   before that.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.600]   Obviously we are in what feels like a serious recession,
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.360]   but the thing is, is that the people who are really
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.040]   getting hurt here are all tied to the mortgage business.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   - Well, they're tied to lending.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.280]   They're tied to credit in general.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.920]   - Yeah, my bank, but more particularly,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.280]   if you look at who's failed, it's mortgage-related.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.120]   - Right.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.360]   - My bank does not. - But that trickles down,
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.280]   though, does it not to?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.120]   - It does, but my bank, for instance, doesn't engage
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.600]   and has not engaged in any subprime loans.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.480]   They're very fat, they're fine, no worries.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.800]   - Well, neither does Goldman Sachs,
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.080]   but their stock price is still depressed.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.120]   - Even with one bucket-
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.360]   - Well, and keep in mind what this really did,
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   the real game-changer here was this did away
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.520]   with the investment banks.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.440]   There are now officially no more investment banks.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.320]   Now where that's going to impact our business
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   is that startups, you know, one of the IPOs I did,
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.960]   you know, back in the '90s was underwritten
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.280]   by an investment bank.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.560]   That's not gonna happen anymore.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.000]   That means it's gonna be harder to get capital.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.200]   So on the development side, you know,
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   businesses trying to develop new products,
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.840]   trying to get floor loans, that's flooring interest loans,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.480]   for instance, like Circuit City needs a loan
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.840]   to keep the computers on the floor until they're sold,
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.600]   so it can pay off Dell.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.920]   Those kinds of loans are gonna start to get tough to get.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.680]   So yes, that is gonna impact real businesses
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.080]   and people are gonna have trouble making payroll
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.040]   and startups in particular are gonna get
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.240]   their butts kicked by this.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.040]   But on the bright side, there are still people out there
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.960]   with money, and if you're out there with money
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.200]   and you look at the landscape where you're gonna put it,
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.240]   some people may decide to start taking more risks
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.520]   on technology companies because they know that,
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.640]   hey, everybody's equally risky now,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.880]   so why not go for the one that where you pull the slob machine,
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.760]   you can win the big, big money?
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.240]   - Well, and the other thing is, is that I mean,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.400]   I've talked about this in the past,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.080]   but I go to a country twice a year in Zimbabwe
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.000]   where there's no credit, there's no usable cash.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.840]   (laughs)
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.360]   There's no, I mean, you know, the cash chain,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   you know, literally, lunch changes to from 200 million
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.840]   to 400 million from day to day.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.480]   You know, I mean, it's a crazy world,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.360]   and you go there, in downtown,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.680]   there's Mercedes from driving around,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.960]   and the place is congested,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.360]   and there's lots of people going to work,
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   and there's lots of people doing it.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.760]   I mean, it's not, I only use that as a worst case scenario
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.960]   that it doesn't mean that the economy will stop.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.520]   You know, there's nothing here
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.000]   that there's always going to be niches.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.160]   I mean, even in the '30s, which is,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.320]   I doubt where we're gonna go here,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.360]   you know, there are still people doing business,
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.680]   and so I think that there's still gonna be opportunities,
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.360]   you know, for a lot of different people,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   and I think Apple will probably be one of those, you know?
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.600]   I don't think that even though they're more expensive,
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.520]   I mean, I don't imagine myself buying, you know,
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.560]   cheaper MP3 players, you know, and--
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.600]   - Maybe, you know, maybe that people won't buy cheaper ones,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.720]   they just won't buy new ones.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.840]   I mean, really, you don't need to buy a new iPod
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.080]   as often as many people do.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.560]   - No, Steve says one a year.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   - Yeah, I know he wants you to buy one a year.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.960]   Man, if I could cut down to one a year, I'd be sad.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.440]   (laughing)
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.240]   - I think the one thing the stock market drop
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.000]   definitely reinforces is how much of any
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.240]   any modern economic sort of situation is psychological.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.040]   So it's not so much about whether people can buy something,
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.880]   but whether they will buy something.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.080]   - Very good point.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.400]   - It's an excellent point, yeah.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.560]   - It's all in your head.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.640]   - And, you know, we're not talking about,
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.320]   on our show, we don't talk about life and death stuff.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.000]   I mean, people that are, you know,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.920]   buying an aperture or a fart game,
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.640]   obviously that's not something they have to have.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.520]   So it is important that there be available cash
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.160]   in the fund for that to happen.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.280]   But, you know, all markets are cyclical.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.920]   All you have to do is go back to the 30s
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.200]   and look at the ups and downs.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.240]   Look at the graph.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   I've done that recently.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.760]   Look at the plot of the markets since the 1930s.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.360]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.640]   You know, it always ends up on balance later on
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.720]   being much higher than it is the day
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.280]   you started thinking about it.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.200]   - What do you guys think of the new MacBooks?
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.640]   Are we gonna see those before the end of the year?
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.520]   Some rumors are sometime in October,
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.600]   they'll be in announcement, new, thin MacBooks.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.080]   Now I'm hearing stories that they won't be tapered
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.440]   that like the MacBook Air,
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.240]   and others say they will be.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.800]   - I'm ready for one, that's all I gotta say.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.440]   - I wouldn't mind a new MacBook.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.280]   - Yeah.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.600]   - I buy those like you buy iPods.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.120]   I can't, every year a new one.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.760]   - I do about every other version, you know,
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   and then somebody else in the company
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.600]   ends up with the one I have.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.520]   - It's such a sickness.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.640]   - Yeah, well at least that's what I do.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.120]   I hand them down to my kids in my life.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.360]   - Haven't we been hearing about the new MacBook forever?
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.040]   - Well we did, we remember where they had got that analyst
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.560]   and now so they're shipped to the stores.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.920]   That was three weeks ago.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.760]   What are we?
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.880]   - We made a ship from China on a slow boat.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.720]   - Where are they?
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.560]   (laughing)
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.800]   - I think that's the problem.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.000]   - How ever thin they are.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.240]   Well, however thin they are,
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.080]   I just hope there's plenty of USB,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.560]   Firewire and every other port on it in the world
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.400]   because I'm always hooking unending peripherals
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   to these things.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.600]   And the little thin new ones,
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.760]   I mean you just, you can't do that.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.240]   There's just not enough ports in them
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.280]   to do all the stuff that we do with them sometimes.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.360]   - You could play X-Plane on a MacBook Air can't you?
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.560]   I mean there's enough juice to do that.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.240]   - Yeah, you can but there's,
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.680]   you really wanna start plugging in joysticks
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.600]   and pedals and stuff to really get good
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.200]   and flying X-Plane by moving your finger around
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.320]   on the mouse pad.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   It is possible.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.160]   - Even with multi-touch.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   - But by goodness it's difficult.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.920]   Yeah, yeah, even multi-touch won't help you there.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.760]   You're a multi-touch won't save you now.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.280]   Not on short final and turbulence.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.360]   So you really wanna have enough peripherals
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.040]   or USB ports to plug in the joystick
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.720]   and maybe some hard drives and whatnot.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.200]   And I run out with anything
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.680]   but kind of a big beefy thick laptop
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.080]   with all the ports I need on it.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   - Right, right.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.520]   But it'd be nice to have a,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.000]   we're talking something maybe half inch thinner
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.520]   but same in many ways, same form factor, just thinner.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.360]   That would be nice.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.200]   I'd love that.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.040]   And lighter.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.880]   Commence really kind of.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.720]   - If you can fit the ports in, yeah.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.800]   - Yeah.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.880]   - Well I need something
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.120]   because my wife now has a computer faster than mine.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.840]   - Well that can't be happening.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.200]   - It's really upsetting.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.040]   It's causing me to question my man.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.400]   She was gonna buy a MacBook
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.120]   and hit up with a MacBook Pro.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.680]   A brand new one with Ram and everything else.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.200]   And, but you gotta get,
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.840]   she moved from a 2001 titanium.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.680]   I mean she had been,
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.360]   the thing was falling off and everything else.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.080]   And so she bought this and I said,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   you know I could buy that and then I could give you mine
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.360]   because I really wanted to win the presentation.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.200]   And.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.040]   - No.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.360]   (laughing)
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.600]   - It seems like I want my own new computer.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.400]   - So, I know I try that with my kids all the time.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.320]   Henry was saying last night,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.160]   "Can I have a notebook?"
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.120]   I said, "Yeah, you can have my own one
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.960]   "and I'm gonna get a new one as soon as the new ones come out."
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.400]   He said, "Do you have anything else?"
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.240]   (laughing)
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.320]   "He doesn't want my own notebook."
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.360]   It's perfectly good.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.640]   Doesn't want my MacBook.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.040]   Hey, we're gonna take a break when we come back.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:21.880]   It's our picks now.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.200]   I didn't warn you Daniel and N Austin
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.520]   but we do every week we do our software
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.760]   or hardware picks of the week.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.600]   So I'll give you a few minutes
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.760]   and you don't have to if you don't want to
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   but if you've got one,
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.000]   I'll give you a few minutes to think about it
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.160]   and we're gonna come back and have those picks in just a second
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.120]   but right now we start with our audible pick of the week.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.480]   Our show brought to you by the good folks at Audible.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.640]   They do those wonderful audio books.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.800]   Anithym now from Neil Stevenson out on Audible.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.200]   I wanna encourage you to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.240]   That's the website where you can sign up today
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.960]   for a free book from their 50,000 books.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.840]   If anybody has a pick, I will seed the floor.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.480]   I'm just gonna write, does it?
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.320]   I will, I will, you, if anybody has,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.720]   the Senator, I give way to the Senator from Gig Haba.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.960]   Mine is the Spartans.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   Oh, just kidding.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.520]   (laughing)
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.160]   He's still reading this, you know what?
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.360]   I started reading that's gonna take--
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.200]   He took point.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.760]   That's gonna take as long as the Spartans
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.360]   is Legacy of Ashes, which is the history of CIA,
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.280]   the CIA, and an amazing book we were talking on Twitter
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.600]   on Sunday with Adam Curry,
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.400]   who is apparently quite the conspiracy theorist.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.320]   He really believes that there's a secret,
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.040]   you know, global government and all sorts of things.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.480]   And I said, well, where can I read more?
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.640]   He said, well, there's, you know,
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   he told me about some sources,
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.960]   but he said Legacy of Ashes is pretty good.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.680]   And this is everybody agrees is the,
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.640]   as close as you get the actual history of the CIA
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.600]   written by Tim Weiner, 21 hours and 25 minutes.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.640]   I just started listening to it
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.920]   and I have to say it is gripping because--
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   You know, I think the most important part
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.240]   of the history of the CIA is--
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.440]   What's that?
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.640]   One of the founders of the CIA is the father of Stuart Copeland,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.000]   who's the drummer for the police--
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.840]   There you go.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.960]   And the great thing was the thing
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.680]   when the only thing I remember is he said,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.800]   Stuart Copeland said he ran away from home
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.600]   when his father was living in Beirut,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.360]   you know, selling Christmas cards or whatever.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.200]   He's told him.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.080]   And he was amazed that his father could find him
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.160]   in like two hours.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.280]   Very quickly.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.320]   He had some real amazing friends.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.120]   Somehow it just didn't take him very long.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.920]   Daniel, do you ever listen to Audible.com?
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.640]   Can we get you signed up?
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.960]   You know, I haven't listened to it yet,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.520]   but I keep, you know, this recurring marketing--
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.560]   The ads are working.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.400]   They're working.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.960]   Yeah, they're getting to me.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.000]   You know what I have?
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.320]   I have such a collection of podcasts
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.960]   that it's priming me for being addicted to--
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.640]   I think that's exactly what happens,
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.720]   is you start listening,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.760]   and then pretty soon you say,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   what else can I listen to?
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.480]   I would think if you're a programmer, this would be--
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.600]   Can you program while you listen to podcasts?
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.640]   Can you write software?
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   Absolutely not.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.400]   I cannot do anything--
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.960]   No words.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.680]   With my brain ears.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.360]   But I do a lot of--
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.200]   You listen to music?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.520]   A lot of programmers listen to music.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.240]   I do sometimes, but not so much.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.960]   I kind of like the dead silence of concentration.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.640]   But what I use the podcasts for,
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.080]   and what I'm sure I would use the audio books for,
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.520]   is it's the perfect excuse for a developer who's,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.280]   you know, sitting on his butt all day
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.400]   to finally get out of his chair and walk around.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.440]   You know, I use it when I go for a walk in the neighborhood,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.200]   go to the gym.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.640]   Anything that really doesn't require my brain to be turned on--
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.360]   Exactly.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.000]   It feels productive to me,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.800]   and you can actually look forward to things like,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.000]   you know, running on a freaking treadmill, right?
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.840]   So anything that can do that is, you know, I think--
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.120]   That's really-- it's been a boon for me for exercise,
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.000]   exactly.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.520]   Austin, do you listen to music when you write software,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.280]   or do you--
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   Oh, constantly.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:57.880]   Constantly.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.000]   I'll just put on the techno.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.240]   But it has to be songs with very little vocabulary.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.120]   I think the words are--
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.040]   Because your brain starts listening to the words.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.280]   If I've got to listen to the words,
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.080]   I'm really going to be not able to code.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.280]   So basically, it's just iced tea or iced coffee
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.480]   and techno for very long periods of time.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:13.960]   It's good.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.520]   It's like my little programming range.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.040]   That's good.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.520]   I like it.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.640]   Now, every now and again, we'll get to an especially tricky problem
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.120]   that involves maybe five, six, seven, eight variables.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.520]   And I have to keep them all straight in my head at once.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   Well, then the music just has to come off for 10 or 15 minutes
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.360]   while I grind through that.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.440]   But for 90% of the coding, it's going
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.160]   to be with instrumental music, typically, tight now.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.040]   That's what happened to me as I aged.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.840]   I couldn't hold those things in my head at once,
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.360]   and I had to get everything up.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   They say baroque music works well.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.240]   Baroque is--
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.160]   I like in beer on myself.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:49.640]   All right.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.720]   Just repeating, repeating, like, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.440]   and that's pretty much--
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.400]   that's all I listen to all.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.280]   Well, I have to do work that requires thinking.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.120]   But see, is the opposite when you exercise or you drive,
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.480]   you want something to distract you.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.920]   You want something in your head.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.400]   I need action films for that.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.600]   Well, that's what I like about Audible.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.040]   Audible is action films in your head.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.280]   You've got to start listening to some of the thrillers.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.880]   That's why the Spartans is going to do it.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.840]   You need to listen to some of the thrillers.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.120]   Because it's like-- I mean, I swear, sometimes I think I saw
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.000]   the movie and I realized, no, I just listened to it on Audible.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.280]   I don't really--
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.200]   I have to admit, so I have a book other than the Spartans
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.160]   on my iPhone all the time that I'm listening to right now.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.920]   It's African rising, Africa rising.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.320]   And to me, it's another way to assimilate more information.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.640]   For me, fiction is--
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.040]   Yeah, you like nonfiction, I know.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.680]   Africa rising, how 900 million African consumers offer more
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.360]   than you think by Vijay Gunther.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.280]   Hey, this looks interesting.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.200]   I'm going to have to listen to this.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.080]   Very good.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.520]   All right, we'll make this our Audible pick.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.080]   How about that?
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.920]   Africa rising.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.000]   Alex Lindsey says, you need to read this book.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.320]   You understand what's happening.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.320]   You know, it's by region.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.480]   It's the largest growth market in the world.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.560]   I think people don't think about it.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.840]   They think of Asia.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.160]   But they don't think of Africa.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.720]   It's a lot of opportunity.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.720]   And apparently, no credit crisis, right?
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   Yeah, because the funny thing is that I was talking to somebody.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.480]   I said, if libertarians really wanted to prove their point,
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.200]   they would go to Zimbabwe right now and start showing them
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.840]   how to-- when the government finally actually switches over,
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.040]   because people are so used to not having a government.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.480]   I mean, the only thing the government does
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.160]   is make it more complicated, which
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.680]   is the truth in many countries.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.360]   But specifically in this one, where people really
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.600]   have to do everything on their own,
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.640]   and everything is figured out.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.400]   So it's a very fascinating--
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.600]   like literally everyone gets paid really quickly,
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.920]   because the money's changing so quickly,
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.320]   that if you need to pay everyone the moment you get the money,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.520]   or it will be worth half tomorrow.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.840]   So there's no 30 day or 90 day.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.120]   It's like six hour--
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.160]   Six hour payable.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.800]   Yeah, I could do that.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.400]   I could use that.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.640]   I could live with that.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.120]   Audible.audible.com/Mac.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.840]   Break it your free book right now.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.480]   You're not already an Audible member.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.400]   Why the heck not?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.040]   We love them.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.840]   I know you will too.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.360]   Audible.com/acron.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.640]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.680]   Now it's time for our Mac Break picks.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.240]   I'll start today, because this is a program I'm using right now.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.680]   We've talked a lot about ROGAMIBA software stuff,
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.960]   and they do a lot of really cool things.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.440]   This is a program that I was looking for a way
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.920]   to broadcast audio of the Twit Live programming.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.400]   Most of you know by now that we do live video while we record
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.080]   the podcast.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.000]   You can watch anytime at live.twit.tv.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.120]   But because the iPhone doesn't support Flash,
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.040]   because a lot of platforms can't handle a Flash,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.360]   people don't have the bandwidth.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:45.560]   A number of people said, look, why not just have an audio stream,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.360]   a lightweight audio stream that anybody can listen to?
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.880]   So I'm playing with it.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   I know a lot of internet radio stations
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.320]   do this using something called ShoutCast.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.120]   I set up a server over the weekend
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.040]   set up with the open source ice cast.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.520]   ShoutCast is a proprietary system.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.480]   Ice cast is similar, but it's an open source.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.880]   So it's running on an Ubuntu server out of Seattle,
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.520]   actually, just up the road a piece from you, Scott.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:15.720]   And I bought a gigabit connection to the internet
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.960]   so that we can peak at a high number.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.400]   I bought four terabytes of bandwidth for the month,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.320]   which would allow 4,000 people to listen all the time nonstop.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.440]   24/7 to our 64K stream.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.400]   But my suspicion is what we'll get as we do with the video,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.560]   peaks and valleys.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.840]   But then I needed a way to get that audio out to the server.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.720]   So I've bought a box.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.880]   I've got a hardware box coming.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.080]   Thursday we'll have a hardware box.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.960]   So just hook up to the mixer and it'll automatically
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   turn it into an MP3 stream that then goes to the server.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.160]   I send one stream out from--
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.080]   because I don't have enough bandwidth here to serve 4,000
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   people.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.160]   So I send one stream to the server in Seattle.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.120]   And the server in Seattle's got all that extra bandwidth
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.080]   to serve all those people.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.880]   But meanwhile, I've been using a program on the Mac called
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.720]   NiceCast.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.920]   I love this.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.320]   In fact, I'm tempted to--
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.640]   maybe I didn't need to buy that box.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.720]   NiceCast is not free, but you could try it for free.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.400]   It's $40.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.840]   It allows you to create your own internet radio station.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.760]   Even if it's just to your house, it has the server built in.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.840]   So if you just want to serve a few people,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.000]   you don't need to set up an elaborate server in gig haba.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.840]   You could just set up a server on your Mac.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.880]   It has a server built in.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.400]   But it will also stream to an external server.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:25.640]   It takes--
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.520]   It actually works really well.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.440]   Have you used it?
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.120]   Yeah, we've used it for the Pixel Core,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.000]   for meetings.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.160]   Fantastic.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.640]   Yeah, it works really, really well.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.800]   It's a very simple, easy to use program.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.000]   You set up the server, and then you
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.960]   can share that URL with people, or you
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.440]   could put it on an external server.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.640]   It'll take the audio right now.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.360]   For instance, it's taking the audio from Safari, which
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.400]   is the live audio and sending it out.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.800]   So it's actually kind of interesting.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.280]   It's taking the audio from stickam
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.920]   and then sending that audio out.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.560]   That's why I eventually want to eliminate that
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.120]   and just have it come directly from the mixer.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.720]   But it's doing a great job.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.880]   You could choose your bit rate anywhere
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.840]   from, I think, it goes down to 8 kilobits up to 128 or higher.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.960]   Audio can be stereo or mono.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.280]   It sends out information about what's playing.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.800]   If you hook it up to your iTunes,
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.480]   it'll actually send out the iTunes track name and everything.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.120]   Very cool.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.040]   Rogamy with just such great stuff.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.440]   This is one I just wasn't aware of until I needed it.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.920]   Icecast--
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.320]   I'm sorry, nice cast for use with icecast.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.480]   It turns your Mac into an icecast server, which, by the way,
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.880]   works with iTunes.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.440]   And soon we will have--
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   this is-- we're in beta test with our stream right now.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.000]   It's just a number.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.200]   But it soon will be Twit.am.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.600]   But you can already listen to it on the iPhone.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   And that's my second pick.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.240]   I'm going to do two picks real quickly.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.840]   Null River-- there are a number of programs
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.520]   on the iPhone that purportedly will pick up icecast streams.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.320]   There's one called Fstream that's free.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   I haven't got that working.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.520]   I have used Null River's Tuner for internet radio,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.400]   which is really a great program.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   599-- it comes with a pre-program with a ton
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.440]   of internet radio stations, all sorts of music, college radio,
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.840]   sports radio talk.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.040]   I mean, you can-- these are--
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.200]   it'll hook into a lot of real radio stations.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.400]   You get ESPN radio.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.240]   You get WFAN out of New York City.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.760]   You get WJFK in Baltimore, XYT in Detroit.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.240]   So you can listen to the Tigers broadcasts.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.520]   Many, many radio stations stream in these formats
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.720]   that this can pick up.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.360]   But you can also add a bookmark for Twit.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.320]   And I'm listening right now.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.560]   In fact, I'll play it back for you.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.440]   This is coming off the iPhone.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.480]   And it even works with Edge, which is kind of remarkable.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.920]   Let me turn it up here.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.080]   Many, many radio stations stream in these formats
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.920]   that this can pick up.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.080]   So it works with Edge.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.200]   I was driving around town listening to Twit Live
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.040]   on my iPhone with this program.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.960]   It's from Null River.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.280]   They're the folks who did the late, lamented, connecting
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.040]   connector program.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.320]   What was that called, Daniel, that connected your--
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.080]   Netshare.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.720]   Netshare.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.800]   And we'll just wait until they get-- this gets pulled off
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.840]   the I2SIR.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.400]   It's really got a great-- great icon.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.960]   It's an old-time radio.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.320]   It's called-- I don't think so, because it fits in
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.520]   with things like AOL radio, which is already on there.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.800]   I mean, it just allows you to listen to other radio stations.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   It sort of proves the ridiculousness of this podcast
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:23.080]   or rejection if it's just purely ostensibly competing
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.440]   with some desktop feature of iTunes.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.320]   Because this is exactly what iTunes does.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.960]   It's the iTunes radio feature, which, by the way,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.600]   nobody uses, which is really cool.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.960]   And because you can use 3G or Wi-Fi, it's pretty amazing.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.200]   I mean, I have to say, I think this is really great
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.600]   that we can stream this out.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.400]   Free audio will be Twit AM.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.240]   But I recommend if you're using an iPhone,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.480]   the program I recommend is Nul Rivers Tuner.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   It's called Tuner Internet Radio, if you're looking for it
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.800]   in your app store.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.280]   We'll put a link on the show notes, too.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.120]   So nice cast for your desktop.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.360]   And then you can stream to your iPhone
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.760]   and pick it up on your Tuner Internet Radio.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.200]   Now that's cool.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.120]   Those are my picks.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.240]   Scott Born.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.720]   What do you got for us?
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.800]   Well, as usual, it's something photo-related.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.920]   I can't help myself.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.520]   That's OK.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.960]   I love this stuff.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.520]   This is only a seventh of an Alex.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.040]   Pretty low price for me.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.320]   Nick, one of my favorite software companies,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.200]   has released Define, which is their noise control program
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:28.880]   as an aperture.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.000]   You did Nick last week.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.200]   You're going to give him a minute.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.840]   But this is a different product.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.440]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.840]   And it actually was two weeks ago.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.640]   But this is a different product.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.760]   This is Define.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.080]   This is their noise reduction plugin.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.480]   Oh, cool.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.160]   And it's only $99.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.360]   And most of Nick's stuff, my complaint about Nick,
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.560]   is that it's a little overpriced.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.040]   But for $99, you cannot complain.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.600]   And this has been available for Photoshop for a while.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.920]   This is $2.1, their latest version.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.360]   But now they got it for aperture,
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.480]   which means you don't need to go out of aperture
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.600]   in order to do your noise reduction.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.800]   And this particular change, there's--
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.760]   in this 2.1 version, you get to do what they call
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.080]   multi-image support.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   So you can select a group of images
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.520]   that were all shot under similar circumstances.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.320]   And once you've figured out the noise reduction,
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.040]   then you can do it to all of them.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.080]   There's also a new, demanding control, which is kind of nice,
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.160]   because it gets rid of those horizontal vertical artifacts
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.640]   that you get sometimes.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.800]   If you're pointing too close to the sun,
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.520]   you get some lens flare.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.880]   And you can try it out for free at nicksoftware.com,
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.480]   which is another thing I appreciate about these guys.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.280]   With some of these high-priced plug-ins for photography,
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.040]   it's nice when they'll let you try them out for free
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.200]   to see what you really think.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.480]   So there's two major ones.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.120]   And I like them both, noise ninja and define.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.760]   You can download them both and try them out.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.040]   But the thing that define offers that's kind of cool
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.520]   is this demanding control.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.040]   Very cool.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:03.320]   We got a big breaking story out of Fortune.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.480]   I'm going to finish the picks.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.280]   And then we're going to go to this breaking story.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.600]   It's just come in from macroomers.com.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.200]   We'll get you the details in just a second.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.760]   But let's move on to the picks.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.720]   And Alex Lindsey, it's your turn.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.400]   So I have an iPhone now.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.640]   And I think I've talked about it,
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.240]   but I don't think I made it a pick before.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.320]   Oh, OK.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.360]   That I have lots of fun with.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.560]   This is one.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.680]   So I sit in airports a lot, and little kids come over
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.000]   watching me play with my iPhone.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.760]   And I found the perfect application for that,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.920]   which is called Face Melter.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.440]   Have you seen Face Melter?
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.840]   Face Melter.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.760]   Face Melter, OK.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.760]   So I think it's like a buck 99.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.880]   So what you do is it activates your phone camera.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.280]   And so you can take a picture of someone.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.160]   So you just get it up there, and you take a picture
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.960]   like you take any other picture.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.440]   But then it essentially gives you a lot of the basic tools
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.360]   that you would have in the warp tools
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:03.240]   like within the old Kai PowerGoo or the Warping Tools
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.840]   within Photoshop.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.400]   So you can literally just do it with your finger,
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.680]   just stretch people's faces and push them in
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.320]   and make their eyes bigger and make their chin smaller
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.920]   and just stretch them all around and make them look pretty goofy.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.720]   It's a great way to entertain kids, just in case you're wondering.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.720]   And I like to say it that way.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.880]   It's kind of like someone taking their kids out
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.840]   to a movie they want to see.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.200]   So I enjoy it, too.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.160]   If there's certain people I don't like,
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.720]   I just take a picture of them and then just squish their heads.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.680]   So it's actually a really, really fun application.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.920]   And it's another one that just really shows you what's possible.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.840]   I think like Xplain, it really shows you
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.160]   where you can take some of these applications.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.720]   So anyway, face-meltered.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.960]   And you can get it on the iTunes App Store.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.880]   Very cool.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.280]   A great pick.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.440]   And now I'm going to give you a chance, Daniel and Alex.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.960]   And if you want to pick your own software, you can.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.880]   Oh, I wouldn't do that.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.000]   There's too much great software out there.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.400]   I'm ready to go.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.040]   I'm ready for--
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   Go right ahead.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:04.680]   This is Daniel.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.720]   Go ahead, Daniel.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   So I wanted to give you a software that's just
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.080]   been released yesterday, which is a cooking application called
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.600]   Sous Chef.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.760]   And this is--
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.960]   this is-- I think you guys could probably take down their website
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.280]   if it wasn't sort of already going down by itself.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.680]   But it's a quesia tree software, ACA-CIA,
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.080]   ACA-CIA tree software.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:37.680]   And this application--
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.120]   there's cooking recipe applications are sort of like--
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.040]   they've been around since spreadsheets.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.680]   Like, every time a new computer platform opens up,
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.680]   it seems like there's a new cooking application that
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.880]   wants to get made.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   And there's some great stuff out there already.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.000]   There's this app called Mac Gourmet that's also quite good.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.440]   But this new one called Sous Chef,
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.680]   I really like some of its features.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.800]   It's cool to use--
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   abusing the term again, cloud computing.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.880]   But this cool feature of any recipes you
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.720]   enter into this recipe book, if you give permission for them
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.800]   to do so, they will take your recipes,
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.920]   put them up on the server.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.800]   And then any other users of the application
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.000]   can search for granola or something.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   And if there's anybody else that's put in a recipe,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.360]   it'll pop up on their version of the desktop app.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.480]   So I think that's really cool.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.440]   And then there's this other feature,
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.560]   which I thought was really obvious and yet really innovative,
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.000]   which is it has a full screen mode,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.920]   kind of the big breakdown for all of these cooking apps,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.280]   I think, has always been you don't really
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.680]   want to get flour and eggs all over your Macbook.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.080]   So what this does is it puts the recipe up
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.960]   in a big full screen mode.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.160]   You can put it across the room from you if you need to.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.160]   They actually call it 10 foot mode.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.440]   And it's thoughtful enough to use a very big font,
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.400]   high contrast, and then it can be configured to respond
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.520]   to your voice commands.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.080]   So this is one of those rare instances
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:16.520]   where the ultimate demo where the demo feature of Mac OS
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.080]   10, its voice recognition, can be used for something really
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.560]   useful.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.080]   I mean, it's practically the only noise you're
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.680]   going to be making is say next step
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.360]   or whatever it is you say, and it'll
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.080]   go on to the next step in the recipe.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.480]   So this is awesome.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.640]   This is fantastic.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.600]   Does it support--
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.520]   I've been using--
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.440]   You know, there were some good menuing and recipe
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.320]   programs for the Mac, and then they kind of all went away.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.840]   And I've been using an old one and I have a big database.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.000]   This is import databases, other recipe databases.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.360]   You know, I didn't look at it close.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.520]   And if I saw it has an import feature,
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.040]   but I don't know exactly what it would work.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.720]   So you must be a cook, Daniel.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.360]   Yeah, well, you know, I try.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.440]   And it's definitely--
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.320]   I'm definitely a cook in the nerdiest way possible.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.760]   So things like this where classic features
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.760]   like being able to adjust a recipe for a different serving
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.400]   size or whatever.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   It also has a cool sort of inventory feature where you can
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.440]   say, I have this much flour in the house, but that's the kind
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.520]   of stuff I don't really see myself actually using.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.360]   It's too much work.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   People talk about that a lot.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.880]   But it has a cool twist on that, which I don't think I've
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.760]   seen before, which is let's you say about some ingredients,
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.720]   I always have this.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.200]   So if you're just the kind of person
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.280]   who you can count on you to have paprika around or something,
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.400]   then it's not going to put that on your shopping list every
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.560]   time you try to make something.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.000]   So I think it just has sort of some thoughtful features
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.640]   and it's sort of upgraded in a way that really takes advantage
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.680]   of the latest stuff in Mac OS X.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.080]   Excellent, excellent stuff.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.160]   Can't wait to try that.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.360]   That's really great.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.400]   That is from acaciatreesoftware.com.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.760]   But I am going to throw in a plug for Mars Edit, which I use
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.840]   religiously to allow.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.680]   That's nice.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.280]   It's a great program from red-swetter.com.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.640]   Oh, I just love it.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.160]   And the guy who runs that company, though, he's kind of a
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.960]   jerk.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.360]   We love it.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.000]   And it's Daniel Punkass on Twitter, which is an
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.280]   appropriate name.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.240]   Oh, that's right.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:28.840]   That's right.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.240]   You forgot about that, huh?
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.000]   I forgot about trying to get the Twitter plug-in.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.400]   The obligatory Twitter plus.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.000]   The Twit Network's Twitter boost.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.760]   Daniel Punkass, Austin Meyer, creator of X-Plane.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.840]   Do you have a pick for us?
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.800]   I'm afraid I don't.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.320]   I've always got to be a little bit of the red-headed step
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.520]   child here and say, I don't know what the latest cool
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.880]   hardware and software is for the iPhone.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.960]   I've been kind of in seclusion for about the last 10 days or
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.160]   so out in Bend, Oregon, learning to fly a new type of
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.040]   airplane.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.240]   And I've been totally buried in that.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.920]   So I have certain hardware and software I like to pick, but
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.080]   it's kind of into the cockpit aviation fields.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.440]   It might not fit into well here.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.720]   Well, we're going to give a plug to X-Plane.com.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.600]   I mean, that's not the address.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:17.960]   What is it?
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.320]   It's X-Plane.com.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:19.800]   It is.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.920]   If you remember the hyphen, X-Pale, X-Pale.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.680]   Yeah, I forget.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.840]   The hyphen.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.680]   There we go.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.080]   That's fine.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.320]   X-Plane.com.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.520]   This is the greatest flight simulator ever from
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.720]   Laminar Research.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.160]   Unbelievable.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.520]   And it even works on the iPhone.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.640]   Just incredible.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.360]   So you've got Mac, Windows, and Linux versions.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.760]   That's correct.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.000]   Basically, the bottom line is we started off.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.960]   I think we're initially just Mac only right near the
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.400]   beginning, and it just went over so quickly to Windows.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.520]   And then more recently, we finally went over to Linux
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.200]   because I got tired of getting a lot of maybe 10 or 20
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.520]   emails a week, something like that.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.040]   Why is your one Linux version?
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.640]   So what I found is if I get an email from someone asking
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.520]   for something, I can either do what they ask or delay them
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.360]   and answer the same email once a day for the rest of my
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:13.680]   life.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.360]   So what I pretty much try and do is whatever someone emails
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.680]   and asks for a feature, I just do it.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.560]   And so as a result, you wind up with a sim like Explain,
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.720]   which can do helicopters, airplanes, autogiros, hot
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.040]   air balloons, you name it.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.760]   Earth, Mars, you can fly in Mars as well.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.040]   And all sorts of different platforms.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.640]   So we try and keep it really flexible, a really, really
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.880]   wide feature set.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.480]   If someone asks for it, I code it, basically, as much as I
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.440]   possibly can.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.560]   You know, Austin, I feel like you've been ignoring my emails.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.040]   I've been emailing for about the past 20 years, and I still
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.000]   haven't seen my Timex Sinclair version.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.000]   Yes, well, there's some emails I'm just going to have to keep
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.160]   getting from the rest of my life.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.680]   I've resigned myself to that.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.720]   Not going to have--
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.120]   $39 is a very good deal there.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.320]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.720]   That price is so low, it's ridiculous.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.800]   I see on the front page you're going to raise the prices soon.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.200]   This thing, I would be charging $79 if I possibly had a
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:08.800]   choice.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.480]   The thing is we got retail distribution as well.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.880]   And one of the requirements that Walmart had is they said,
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.720]   look, really happy to take Explain, but only if it's
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720]   priced at $39.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.400]   Really?
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.680]   And so yeah, Walmart is very, very, very serious about their
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.200]   pricing.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.880]   You don't find a lot of expensive stuff there.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.040]   They really work hard to keep the price down.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.760]   Obviously, that works great for their consumers, and it
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.960]   works great for them.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.560]   But for people like me, that puts me in a situation where
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.480]   I'm saying, hm, well, I want to sell at Walmart, so I'm going
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.960]   to price it at $39.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.920]   But I don't want to overprice more.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.480]   I don't want to overcharge on my website and charge
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.880]   somebody more than at Walmart.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.560]   So this $39 deal, it's in place now to lower the price to
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.320]   lowest common denominator, if you will.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.640]   It's not going to last forever, though.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.440]   I'll tell you that, because right now this price point is
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.360]   just so low.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.720]   It almost costs as much to ship it as it is $39.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.600]   No, to a lot of international destinations.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.680]   I bet that cut that Walmart takes makes the $70.30 split
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.480]   on the App Store look pretty sweet.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.320]   Yeah, I'm not talking about that.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.720]   Yeah, I'm not sure what it's supposed to talk about.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.880]   But I can tell you from the retail distribution standpoint,
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.200]   I know I can talk about that.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.360]   And what I can tell you is in retail distribution, the
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.000]   developer, someone like me, will then sell to the publisher
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.720]   and then the publisher to the distributor and then the
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.480]   distributor to the retail outlet.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.160]   And everybody takes maybe brown numbers, half of the
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.280]   profit at each step along the way.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.080]   And so for a retail sale, what the developer gets might be a
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.480]   half of a half of a half.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.320]   So do the math on that one of the actual sale value of the
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.040]   product.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.240]   Whereas when you buy directly from the developer from their
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.680]   website, well, they get the entire amount.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.000]   And so it's kind of an interesting little age we're
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.360]   moving into when I look at the actual profit breakdown
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.640]   between internet sales and retail sales.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.000]   The internet sales are really accounting for a
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.440]   significantly larger percentage of the total cash
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.280]   revenue to Laminar Research than the retail outlets.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.800]   And it's partially because the volume is so good at
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.840]   Explained.com.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.960]   The web just does a good volume.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.200]   It's also partially because when you buy from Explained.com,
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.480]   I get the entire amount.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.320]   When you buy from Walmart or something, I get a half of
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.760]   half of a half.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.480]   So we're really, really seeing the sea change here.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   And I'm absolutely seeing it in the bottom line.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.160]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   Wow.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.680]   You could have, you actually could have made a pick.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.440]   You could have picked your new segue.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.720]   My segue scooter, do you mean?
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.840]   I don't have that anymore.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.640]   Oh, you don't have it?
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.400]   I sold it.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.200]   It was too dangerous.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.240]   Okay, so I got to, people that know me know I'm a
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.600]   Corvette maniac and a light airplane maniac as well.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.680]   And you might think that a segue being the least
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.520]   powerful, slowest moving of all my things would be a safe one.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.280]   But the problem about a segue is if you fall off of that
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.200]   thing, you might fall off into traffic, you know?
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.480]   And at this point, you're going to get run over by an SUV.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.480]   I can at least have an accident in my Corvette.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.240]   No, I'm fairly well protected.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.960]   It's just not the same with the segue.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.960]   And at high noon, you don't see all the little dips and
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.560]   rises and undulations and the pavement.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.680]   You don't see the shadows.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.000]   And so at high noon, if you ride a segue over a bump at full
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.840]   speed, well, you know, 13 miles an hour, doesn't sound fast.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.080]   Oh, I crashed more times than you can imagine.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.280]   And then I had to take the segue to like family reunions
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:23.760]   and stuff.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.880]   It was like a blood pack.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.920]   All my little cousins are coming out of the place
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.440]   behind their parents.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.080]   And then I'd lend it to friends.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.480]   And the thing would come back after I'd lend it to friends
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.160]   that come back, look like it had been through the battle of
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.400]   the bulge, you know, like every part scraped.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.320]   Oh, I mean, run ending at a church pews, parked cars, you
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:40.840]   name it.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.520]   My segue has been run into it.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.720]   So, you know, on the bright side, all the injuries have been
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.400]   very, very minor.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.520]   But on the down side, there's plenty of little scrapes and
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.320]   bruises.
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.200]   And it only has to happen once that you get pitched off of
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.480]   the segue in front of a moving car and then it's no fun
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.440]   anymore, right?
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.120]   So I actually did sell the segue just because there's a
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.760]   little dangerous for my taste.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.040]   I'm just curious.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.200]   Did you give this rundown of accents to the new buyer?
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.000]   I try to always be positive on my site.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.440]   Let the buyer beware.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.560]   But I didn't mention anything.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.360]   I know, I know.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.200]   But go ahead.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.560]   I was going to say, you just told the buyer to try out
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.800]   explain for a few minutes.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.360]   And that'll give him a good idea of what it's going to be.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.240]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.560]   So before we wrap up, I just want to mention that Thursday,
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.200]   the Copyright Royalty Board is, according to Fortune, is
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.720]   going to rule on the request by the National Music
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.280]   Publishers Association to increase royalty rates.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.720]   It'll come on Thursday for online downloads.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.880]   Now, remember, they're talking also about raising the
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.680]   rates for internet radio.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.720]   The music industry just apparently seems to be gluttonous,
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.040]   greedy, and frankly, to the point of self-destruction.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.960]   Now, the Music Publishers Association is asking that the
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.600]   Copyright Royalty Board raise rates, royalty rates, on
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.200]   online stores from $0.09 to $0.15 a track.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.480]   $0.15-- this isn't the record companies, by the way.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.120]   These are people who own the publishing rights.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.880]   Apple has submitted a statement saying, if the iTunes
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.240]   music store were forced to absorb any increase in the
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.480]   royalty rate, the result would be to significantly increase
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.920]   the likelihood of the store operating at a financial
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.920]   loss, which is no alternative at all.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.160]   Apple has repeatedly made it clear that it is in this
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.560]   business to make money and most likely would not continue to
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.640]   operate the iTunes music store if it were no longer possible
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.400]   to do so profitably.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.600]   So, Apple's telling the Copyright Board, if you were to
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.040]   adopt this increase in royalty rates on Thursday,
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.080]   we'll close the iTunes music store.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.440]   That would be one way to get the music industry.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.440]   And I believe what we're talking about here is I think
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.240]   the National Music Publishers Association, I think, is
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.480]   different than the--
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.640]   Not the record industry.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.880]   It's not the record industry.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.400]   These are the people who are publishing rights, which are--
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.440]   the way we handle rights is so messed up in this country.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.360]   So, all of this stuff is all broken up into a whole bunch
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.080]   of different groups.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.560]   And so, these guys, this is a different conversation from
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.920]   the ones they need to go through.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.160]   Stop the RA, right, exactly.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.640]   I don't know-- I haven't seen any indication on how likely
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.800]   the Copyright Royalty Board is to approve this rate increase.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.840]   They did improve the rate increase requested by the
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.680]   record companies, even though it was a significant
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.320]   increase and perhaps will put internet radio out of business.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.440]   You have to think these guys are shooting themselves in the
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.640]   foot here.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.240]   If Apple were to close the iTunes music store, it would cost
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.400]   them far more than they stand to gain from this--
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.760]   If these guys push the price up and Apple had to close the
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.800]   iTunes music store, I really wouldn't feel bad about
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.240]   torrenting stuff.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.720]   I just want to say that.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.120]   Doesn't sound like the--
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.760]   I'd be like, that's their problem, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.760]   I'm just wondering if we could have a show of hands.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.880]   How many people actually believe that Apple would
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.280]   actually close the store?
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.320]   I believe they'd close it if they were forced to lose money.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.120]   And I don't think they would just raise the prices.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.320]   I mean, they were talking about--
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.560]   they are like the--
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.160]   aren't they now the biggest music retailer in the world?
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.000]   Or something like that?
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.200]   Number one in the US beating Walmart.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.880]   But yeah, so that's a good point.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.840]   They do have the option just to pass along with the consumer.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.880]   It sounds like an way more empty threat than iPhone
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.360]   developers threatening to stop developing for the iPhone.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.920]   Would it kill the iPod if Apple stopped the--
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.440]   I don't think so.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.720]   I mean, I buy almost all my music now on Amazon.com.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.240]   It wouldn't.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.160]   You'd still have iTunes.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.720]   You just wouldn't have the store.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.560]   Right.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.080]   I'm looking at it this way too, though.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.840]   The store is obviously so--
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.720]   so it gives Apple so much power.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.960]   I think that they're probably bluffing a little bit
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.560]   when they say they wouldn't be willing to take a loss on it.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.920]   Because even if they had to somehow work in some kind
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.440]   of subsidizing of the store with their iPod prices
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.720]   or something like that, then it seems like this sort of strangle
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.680]   hold they have over online music is going to continue to serve them.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.240]   Presumably they'd still said movies and TV.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.320]   I don't know if they have that strangle hold, though,
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.240]   because I think that the music industry has pretty much said to Apple,
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:26.880]   "Screw you.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.360]   We're not going to let you sell DRM-free cuts.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.400]   We're going to let everybody else do it."
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.960]   I could see Apple saying, you know what?
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.280]   This business is not as good as it once was.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.400]   You don't see Apple just raising the price a little bit.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.320]   I mean, we're used to paying $0.99 or $9 or whatever at the iTunes.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.160]   If it were anybody but Apple--
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.240]   If it were anybody but Apple, I'd say, yeah, sure.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.880]   Of course they would.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.440]   If it were Sears, of course they would, but Apple, I don't know.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440]   It is a problem.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.120]   Steve Jobs has a history of making point 21s too, obviously that.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   Exactly.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:03.040]   Now, he wanted to be able to land his helicopter in certain places
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.560]   in the Bay Area, and they said he couldn't,
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.960]   and he said, "Well, I guess I could just move the company."
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.720]   And he would too.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.320]   Well, we'll see.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.240]   Maybe it's an empty threat.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.320]   Maybe it's a real threat.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.720]   Certainly it's a scary thought, and we'll find out on Thursday
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:19.400]   if the copyright royalty board does raise those royalties.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.880]   I think, of course, Microsoft and at Zoon Store,
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.000]   they'll just raise the price.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.160]   Rhapsody, they'll just raise the price.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:31.200]   But Apple, I could see Apple saying, we wash our hands of it.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.520]   Well, I think in some ways they've
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.400]   had what they needed to get out of it.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.320]   As I said, I've moved on.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.720]   I don't buy-- I still buy some knee jerk stuff.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.320]   Like, oh, I just want to listen to this right now.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.520]   And if I want to do it quickly, I'm still
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.400]   going to buy it from iTunes.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.040]   If I'm trying to show someone something or I'm going for a trip,
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.720]   I'll grab 10 or 15 songs that I just want right now.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.680]   And I don't want to deal with dealing with the Amazon store.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.440]   But generally, for stuff that I want to keep,
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.040]   I'm buying everything from the Amazon store.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.360]   It doesn't mean that I'm going to buy another player.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.040]   And that's where Apple's making its money.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.720]   I'm not going to go start playing it on some little mp3 player.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.440]   I mean, I have a bunch of iPods in my iTunes,
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.680]   and I'm still going to use those.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.720]   So I don't know.
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.760]   I'm sure that it gives them a lot of leverage.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.920]   But they may be getting to a point where the music industry is
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.080]   becoming more trouble than it's worth to them.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.760]   I think that you're right that they've already gotten so far
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.080]   along that they can maybe afford to suspend the iTunes
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.200]   store or something like that.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.680]   But there's a lot of-- I think there's
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.000]   a lot of rippling effects of power
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.920]   that having users already in the pattern of shopping
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.440]   on the iTunes store gives them.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.920]   And they're obviously getting more and more interested
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.080]   in things like movies and the app store selling apps.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.640]   And who knows where this is going to go?
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.360]   Maybe they'll start doing more desktop selling, desktop apps
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.160]   through the iTunes store.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.280]   It's sort of like their version of the Walmart store.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.400]   And they're getting a lot of people coming into through the doors
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.720]   because of that music store.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.560]   And they already have their Apple ID.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.200]   And they're already ready to then just one-click purchase
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.040]   something.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:10.400]   So I think that it would be a very sad, disgraceful thing
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.120]   for Apple if they suddenly gave up on this flagship product
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.680]   for their store.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.120]   And it might prevent a lot of people being sort of ready
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.560]   to pull the trigger on other products that
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.080]   are for sale there now and other things they might have coming up.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.960]   That's a good point, too.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.400]   It might send a chilling effect to the rest of the market, huh?
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.600]   Well, I think that also-- one of the things I'm interested in
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.800]   is to see-- I think that Apple is really missing
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.760]   one big opportunity, which is tying the distance between
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.280]   or shortening the distance between people
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.880]   who are developing on their software via Final Cut Studio,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.760]   iMovie, or Logic, or GarageBand, or whatever,
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.880]   tying that tighter to distribution.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.920]   The idea of being able to publish much more directly
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   and much more easily between one and the other,
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.920]   I think, should terrify Hollywood.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.640]   And I think that if-- and the music industry-- and I think
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.880]   that if Apple gets pushed too hard,
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.600]   I think that that's their next option.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.360]   And I think that if they got good at it,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.400]   I think that they could really start cutting into--
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.640]   I mean, now that they have the largest music store
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.720]   in the world, they could really start
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.160]   cutting into people's bottom line
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:27.480]   by just giving artists a much more direct route to the store.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.520]   We'll see.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.480]   Thursday's the day.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.120]   Copyright royalty board will respond.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.600]   I wouldn't put anything past Apple.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.800]   That works Steve Jobs.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.560]   He can be the petulant kid just as much
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.360]   as anybody, and because he rules with an iron fist.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.600]   Of course, it is still a publicly held company.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.760]   He still has to have to respond to stockholders,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.080]   much as he'd like to pretend he doesn't.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.160]   And with a stock price tanking, who knows?
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.600]   What would happen on the stock market
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.720]   if Apple closed the iTunes music store?
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.960]   Yikes.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.800]   I don't know.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.360]   It would be good.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.520]   It's an interesting question, Leo,
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.920]   because so much of what Steve Jobs seems to skate on
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.960]   is, of course, the products, but also the fact
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.480]   that the stock price has been sailing
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.080]   for the past several years.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.080]   And if the stock depression continues,
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.200]   then he doesn't sort of have that wind in his sails more.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.400]   That's a very good point.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400]   He's not the fair-haired boy.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.240]   Well, we really thank you all for joining us,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.800]   especially want to thank Austin Meyer and Daniel Jalkaud.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.520]   It's really nice to have the developer's point of view on here.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.720]   Austin is at x-plane.com.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.440]   And again, thank you for an incredible port to the iPhone.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.200]   You've got plans for that?
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.680]   Oh, lots of plans.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.400]   And I can tell you what they are if you like.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.960]   So what we're looking for is we want to have lots of runways.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.000]   Right now, there's one runway, and it's great for practicing
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.760]   take-offs and landings and stuff.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.160]   We're going to add more runways and a map functions
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.640]   you can navigate from one runway to the other.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.440]   We'll put in some more airplanes.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.640]   And I think I just may be able to squeeze an instrument
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.840]   panel in there as well.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.120]   So you'll tap a little view menu, bring up an instrument
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.720]   panel, and then you'll actually be able to practice flying
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.120]   really from an aviator's level, where you're actually
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.720]   practicing your instrument landing system
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.480]   and instrument skills.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.240]   And you can sit there on the wing of your airplane
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.640]   while you're waiting for it to get fueled or get maintenance done
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.160]   or whatever, practicing the flight to come on your phone
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.360]   and then just pop off the phone and hop in the cockpit
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.880]   when you're ready to go for the real flight.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.400]   That sounds very cool.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.160]   Exciting things coming up.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.760]   Right now, the phone is a great--
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.680]   or x-plane for iPhone is a great technology
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.480]   demonstrator for how cool the iPhone is
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.320]   and how powerful it is.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.240]   And it flies just like the real airplane.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.320]   But once we get in maps and airports and instrument panels,
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.600]   then it's no longer just a demonstrator showing
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.880]   how cool the iPhone is.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.240]   It's no longer something you can just play with for fun,
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.480]   like you can now.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.240]   But it actually becomes a flight training and flight currency
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.440]   tool that is available for so little money so conveniently.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.200]   And you've got it at your fingertips everywhere.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.160]   And so that's really going to be a fun little sea change
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.560]   for aviation when you get out into the airplane
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.240]   and the transition between the simulator
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.760]   and the real airplane actually becomes kind of razor thin.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.280]   You just kind of effortlessly transition from one
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.760]   to the other.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760]   What we look forward to, will that be a free upgrade
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.400]   to people who have already bought?
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.760]   Oh, yeah, as much as possible.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.280]   Definitely.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.160]   The stuff I just described will be free updates.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.600]   Now, I've got more products lined up as well.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.480]   And some other stuff that is not going to be free.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.280]   But the things I described just now
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.000]   are very natural increases to the x-plane version that's
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   out there right now that would absolutely fit
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.760]   within the free upgrade idea, for sure.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.400]   Well, very good.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.200]   We'll look forward to it.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.360]   Thank you, Austin.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.240]   Next-play.com and go to the Apple--
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.200]   as long as you can, go to the iApp store
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.720]   and download a copy.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.640]   It was at $9.99.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.600]   It's really a worth--
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.320]   Yeah, $9.99.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.840]   It's a really great deal and a very worthwhile purchase.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.280]   And don't forget, prices are going up at x-plane.com.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.440]   Quick, get your simulator right now.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.480]   Daniel Jalka, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.600]   red-swetter.com.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.280]   This is the day of the dashes.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.040]   Indeed.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.240]   I guess it's hard to get domain z's.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.200]   domain names these days.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.240]   Of course, Mars Edit, there's the crossword program
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:06.960]   you're working on.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.720]   When are your iPhones?
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.520]   App's going to be out, you know?
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.920]   Oh, as soon as I possibly can get them done.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.440]   My work is definitely cut out for me.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:19.040]   It's great to have a couple apps that people are just
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.800]   ceaselessly reminding me that they're waiting for.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.000]   And so that's really cool.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.640]   And I'm just working on it as much as I can
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.320]   and getting things closer.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.840]   But if you don't mind, I would also
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.480]   like to drop a quick plug for a podcast I do.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.080]   No, not at all.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:35.680]   Go ahead, please.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.320]   And it's a little-- it'll appeal to other developers
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.160]   who might be listening and also to anybody who sort of wants
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.960]   to take a peek into developer lifestyle.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.120]   I guess it's developer lifestyle podcast.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.920]   It's called Core Intuition.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:53.240]   And I do it with my friend, Manton Reese, who does Wii Transfer.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.520]   And it's at coreint.org.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.240]   And I hope some of you guys will check it out.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:58.640]   Cool.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.280]   Coreint.org.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.120]   So it's for developers or would non-developers be interested?
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.080]   I've noticed over the years blogging, talking to people,
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.560]   power users, they're sort of like this group of people
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.680]   who are not necessarily even developers,
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.080]   but they're just sort of fascinated by the development
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.440]   process.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.920]   They sort of-- they want to know what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.360]   They want to see what's behind the curtain.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.720]   And it's not really-- it's nothing too technical.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.160]   A lot of us just talking about sort of how we're taking in
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.400]   the developer landscape and how things are progressing for us,
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.480]   how we deal with things like customer support.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.320]   Oh, that's great.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.080]   I want to listen to it.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.440]   That sounds really interesting.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.720]   Yeah, I hope you check it out.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:44.360]   Coreint.com.org.org.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:44.920]   Coreint.org.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.320]   Thank you, Daniel.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:50.120]   Twipphoto.com is a place to go to get all your photography
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.560]   information, find out why the 5D Mark II isn't
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.640]   going to kill the D3, and find out what--
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.840]   all great tours in the Yosemite tour.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.880]   I'm excited about that.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.240]   That's coming up the week after Macworld.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.600]   Scott Born is the host there.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.480]   We open up that contest at F64.com this weekend.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.240]   Leo, you cannot buy your way into this workshop.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.200]   You have to be invited or win a seat.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.880]   Somebody invited me.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:14.440]   I invited you.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.400]   I'm excited.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.480]   Is it OK if I bring my mark, too?
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.360]   You can bring anyone.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.800]   I hope I have one by then.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.320]   I may bring my son, actually.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.960]   He's very interested in photography,
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:28.840]   and he loves Yosemite and loves the snow.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.920]   So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.480]   Bring anybody and everybody you want,
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.280]   and we're going to have that contest open up this weekend.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:34.880]   So check it out.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.440]   That's at F64.com.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.000]   F64.com.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.240]   Very good.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.600]   Thank you, Scott.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.200]   I hope the stock market goes up for you.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.040]   Me, too.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.080]   Yep.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.480]   Alex Lindsey, he's ready.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.600]   He's going to the farm.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600]   He's got the generators.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.520]   You know I got a Bible.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.080]   I got it some guns.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.080]   Yeah, I should admit.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:55.840]   I got my bitterness.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.040]   I'm going to go into this thing.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.800]   He's clinging to his guns and religion.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.320]   Out there.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.120]   By the way, I just want to let people know
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:06.240]   that we've got a really cool class coming up in October.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.920]   We've got Dan Ablin.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.600]   A lot of people have been wanting to--
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.760]   have been asking us to do some 3D classes, actual sit down
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.320]   classes.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.200]   And so we brought in one of the top modeling trainers
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.960]   in the world, Dan Ablin.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.560]   And he's going to be teaching a class on Modo, which
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.320]   is the modeling app, one of the modeling apps.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.200]   We use Modo and Cinema 4D and XSI.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.600]   But Modo is one that we like to do a lot of modeling in.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.160]   And so anyway, he's going to be doing that end of October.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.880]   I think it's October 20th through the 24th.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.600]   And people can find out more information at pixacore.com.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   Com.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.840]   You can find the shows at dot TV and theclassin.com.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.240]   Easy to remember.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.200]   Gosh.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.280]   Alex Lindsey, Scott Born, Austin Meyer, Daniel Jalkut.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.400]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.040]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.280]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.640]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
