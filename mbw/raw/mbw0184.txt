[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   where we talk about all things Apple's starting off in the left corner, Mr. Alex Lindsey of thePicksacord.com.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Hey, Alex, how are you?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I'm doing great.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We can all do this show like this.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We're going to do the whole show like this.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It's going to be fantastic.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Also with us right now, Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Mufflin Mann is seated at the table in the laboratory of his utility muffin lab.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I'm doing great, Leo.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's great to be here, and Skype is going, working great.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, actually, we love Skype.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Skype's really kind of the empowering technology that makes it all possible here.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And the person who loves it the most is actually Andy and not go.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Let's say hi to Andy over there in Boston.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   From high atop the melody of all room in Castinot del Nevada.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's a 7% radio show starring Bobby Masterson, Bill Murray, Follies Follie Fosason,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and of course he'll bring his nash-coutie ramblers.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And now he'll talk.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I love that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I love that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You see, he was going 70s.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I was going 30s and 40s.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I like it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I like it.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You know, we're jumping all over the place.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We got a little time machine here going on the show.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hey, big story.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Big, big, big story.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Big story.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Steam.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Steam.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's coming to the Mac.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Are any of you gamers?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You're kind of a casual gamer.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I only played plants and zombies.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But the...
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I had to actually go find out what Steam was.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Oh, I'm a PC fan.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's much more of it.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So I didn't really know what it was.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I was like, what is this?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I better know this before the show starts.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So really you're able to down...
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's really changed PC gaming entirely.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's completely reinvented PC gaming.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You create a Steam account.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I think it kind of came off of the MMORPG kind of things or the online gaming thing.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But they said, wait a minute.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   What we'll do is create a server.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Valve owns it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We'll put our games on it, but you don't even have to own the games.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You can buy the games online.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You can download them from us.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Steam does some really amazing marketing stuff.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You'll get a weekend deal on a game for $10.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's just it is really transformed PC gaming.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And of course, PC gaming is on Windows only and Mac people.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I think we've kind of felt left out.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I think that had a lot to do with Mac people being more productive.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Well, forget it because...
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Angry cranky.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Forget it because your productivity is just and it's late in the gentleman.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I saw that it had civilizations which is...
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I had a friend that I was staying at his house and he had civilizations and I stayed up.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The reason I don't play a lot of games is not because I don't like them.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's because I like them too much.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And civilizations is on here, I guess.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It's really addicting.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Andy, are you a gamer?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I can't remember if you...
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Not really.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm in that category of...
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Kind of like Alex Sperts.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I make my living, spending many, many hours a day doing this.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And if I spent more...
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Those hours a day doing this instead, it would have a dual-prong negative effect which is that there would be less hours I spent actually doing my job.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And also eventually I would need to help her monkey to do my keyboarding for me.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And that's to not happen.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Right.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   But yeah, I'm more of a more of like an iPhone gamer and a PSP gamer.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I think we've all become that way with age maybe.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Merlin, you're Mr. Productivity.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You probably don't know.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Well, why am I Mr. Productivity?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Because I'm totally distractible.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.260]   I don't play a lot of these really absorbing games.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.880]   I played the legend of Zelda once,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.220]   and I made a horse gallop in a circle for half an hour
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.360]   when my wife yelled at me.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.060]   Copped him to the wee...
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.340]   "Tick-a-tock-a-tock-a-tock-a"
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.980]   for 30 minutes.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.400]   They were just like, "D you like to hit the thing?"
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.240]   (laughing)
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.340]   "But she's a good manlands gamer."
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.180]   No, not really.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.120]   Which you knew that you were supposed to hit the thing.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   Well, is this, let me ask you this.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.940]   So this is the kind of game, is this game benefit
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.280]   from that kind of network effect
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.540]   where like, when more people...
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.140]   Oh, well, "Prince of Persia" was a good example,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.220]   it was a network game.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.260]   But all games now, very few games are single player only.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.740]   Well, this improved the gameplay for people
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.060]   to have Mac folks coming in.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.060]   Is it changing for the folks who are already playing it?
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.500]   What Steam says is they're going to start with Portal 2.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.580]   Portal's that great orange box thing
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.520]   that our friend Jonathan Colton wrote the song
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.220]   still alive for.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.140]   And what a great game that is.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.980]   It's really fun.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.820]   But it's a puzzle game.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.500]   It's kind of game you guys would actually like.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.180]   It's more of a puzzle game than a shooter,
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.140]   that a quick twitch shooter.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.780]   But Valve also does Counter Strike, Half Life 2,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.220]   and a lot of those games are going to be on the Mac.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.300]   And what they say is they're going to start doing...
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.220]   This is, you know, what's happened is that
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.300]   PC gaming has been struggling.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300]   Most of these companies have been doing console versions,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.660]   simultaneous releases of console versions.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.060]   That's really where they make their money.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.300]   And I think they see Mac...
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.040]   Once they've got that kind of pipeline going
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.820]   of multi-platform development, now they can say,
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   "Well, we'll just add the Mac."
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.060]   It's like we're doing an Xbox 360, a PS3,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.620]   a Windows and Mac version, and we'll release small settings.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.940]   And a lot of times what they're doing is they're using
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.020]   a coding shell.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.300]   So once you do that, they kind of start going through that.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.620]   They still do all their programming,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.940]   and it all sits inside of something
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.460]   that's been abstracted from the Xcode.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.100]   So the Xcode just holds it there,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.540]   and then everything exists inside of that.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.660]   I don't know if that's how they're doing it,
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.980]   but that's the easiest way for them to port
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.820]   from platform to platform is not try to interact
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.820]   with the platform very much.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.900]   And a lot of these multiplayer games are not...
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.380]   You know, they're not...
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.180]   A lot of the games that I saw that they were showing
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.540]   are not massive, you know, need every CPU cycle.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.860]   - Portal no, but Left 4 Dead,
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.140]   which will be the other title that will come out,
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.140]   is a pretty good Twitch gaming game.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.900]   It's really fun.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.140]   This will be in April.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.580]   It says, "Steve's director of development said,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.820]   'We are treating the Mac as a tier one platform.'
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.660]   So all..."
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.620]   This is such good news for Macintosh users.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.740]   And you know, for Apple in general.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.940]   So all of our future games will release simultaneously
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.180]   on Windows Mac in Xbox 360.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.020]   That's huge.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.980]   - Just think of playing civilizations on an iPad.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.180]   That I really can't ever install that.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.020]   That's all I gotta say.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.860]   - Oh yeah, you know.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.540]   - I see myself on that train going through
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.540]   four or five stations past my house.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.380]   - Where am I?
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.700]   - Yeah, wherever I am.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.540]   - Looking up.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.380]   - I'm a Connecticut.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380]   - I thought I was in the 13th century.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.220]   - I'm invading.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.060]   - I'm invading.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.380]   - Yeah.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.100]   So what's also cool is Mac and Windows players
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.220]   will be in the same universe so that the servers
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.500]   will be the same, the lobbies will be the same.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.180]   So this took a lot of time.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.540]   It took a lot of work for them to get it done.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.180]   And they said they got a lot of support from Apple
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.020]   to get it done.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.860]   - They'd have to.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.860]   It shows that OpenCL and OpenGL platforms
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.020]   on the Mac have parity.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.940]   The Mac hardware is up there that they can play these games.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.420]   And by the way, PC customers who've already purchased
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.300]   a game for the PC, which includes me, I buy a lot of...
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.980]   You know, for the most part, PC gamers now, it's Steam.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.620]   And if it's not on Steam, I kind of...
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.580]   But it almost always is.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.940]   - So it's a platform, it's not just a game,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.780]   it's a platform.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.580]   - Yeah, oh, exactly.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.900]   It's a lifestyle.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.380]   It's a hat.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.260]   - Steam has a wonderful plan for your life, Merlin.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.580]   Give yourself to it willingly.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.180]   - You log in, run your Steam client,
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.420]   you log into your Steam, it'll show you
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.060]   what games you have installed.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.900]   Now you still install them to your desktop.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.260]   I mean, not playing the game online,
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.420]   you're playing it on your desktop,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.660]   but it connects through the Steam servers.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.940]   So if you buy a game, you download it, and it's big,
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.540]   just like you're, you know, it's gonna be gigabytes,
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.500]   just like it's on a DVD.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.100]   But the games are cheaper.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.420]   If you have it, oh, this is, I love this.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.500]   If you buy it on one machine,
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.780]   and then you log in on another machine,
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.780]   you can say, oh, I'm gonna download those same games.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.020]   And they're gonna do that with PC customers,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.980]   you'll get the Mac version of the game as well.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.180]   - So you have to have a connection, so it can check.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.060]   - You know, well, this was a big story, actually.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.740]   Assassin's Creed II, Ubisoft, this crappy DRM in it
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.700]   that required you, even if you're playing the single person,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.300]   Steam, you don't, I guess you could play it single person.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.700]   I did Bioshock that way, but most games now,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.220]   it's the online play that's critical.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.860]   Anyway, Assassin's Creed II, which has both online
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.220]   and single player campaign,
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.300]   you couldn't play unless you were online.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.580]   So you had to get online to verify the DRM
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.100]   and their servers went down this weekend.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.180]   So people had the game and couldn't play it.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.700]   - I bet you that didn't go very well.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.380]   - I'm not going for one.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.580]   And well, and the irony is that the DRM,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.580]   which was much loathed, was cracked within 24 hours anyway.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.780]   So the pirates can continue to play just the legitimate users.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.620]   - Exactly.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.220]   - There's a point there somewhere, not that we want to make it.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.740]   - No, well, we did, I think.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.500]   - My friend Chris Coljourne used to have this great line,
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.340]   my friend back in college, and he would always say,
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.020]   what his quote from his dad, he'd say,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.300]   the main thing you gotta do is you gotta keep
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.700]   the honest people honest.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.180]   You know, it's like latching the screen door.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.940]   It's not, it's gonna keep the cats and the--
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.780]   - Well, that's a good deal.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.980]   - And the drift result, but it's not gonna stop somebody
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.340]   who really wants to get in your house.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.300]   And you're never really gonna stop somebody
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.100]   who really, really, really wants to get in your house.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.940]   And all you're gonna do is really
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.540]   inconvenience your family, trying to get in and out.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.380]   - The difference is that you incent honest people
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.420]   to become thieves when you do this kind of thing.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.380]   And that's the real problem is that,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.940]   you know, for, so let's say you have Assassin's Creed 2,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.140]   you can't play it, well, what am I gonna do?
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.140]   I'm gonna go look for the crack so that I can play it.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.660]   - What if I lock myself out of the house?
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.500]   What am I gonna do?
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.900]   I'm gonna kick the door open.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.900]   - Oh, I guess maybe that's just me.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.740]   (laughing)
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.580]   - Well, also I mean like, wait, just as--
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.420]   - Wow.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.220]   (laughing)
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.060]   - I think we've all learned something today.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.300]   Mainly don't lock the door.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   (laughing)
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.300]   - You went from the Starsky and Hudge School of Locksmithing,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.740]   obviously. (laughing)
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.140]   - Anyway, I'm just, I think that one of the things
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.420]   that's held Mac adoption back considerably
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.460]   is the lack of good games on the Mac platform.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.740]   I mean, whenever anybody asks me, should I buy a Mac,
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.620]   I would always say yes, unless you're a gamer.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.860]   Now we don't have to say that anymore.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.700]   I think that this is, this is parody.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.700]   - Is there something on it?
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.300]   - Sorry, go ahead Andy, sorry.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.140]   - Sorry, I said.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.620]   - Oh, there's something that, this is kind of related
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.500]   to something, we've mentioned in the advertising thing,
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   when we're talking about advertising,
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.780]   about how advertisers wanna go after people,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.860]   that don't buy their product,
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.660]   not people who already have it, by and large.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.020]   And it's interesting, I think one thing that,
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.740]   from a consumer standpoint, we're always surprised
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.660]   when we hear something like this.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.380]   And we go, oh gosh, that's really crazy.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.820]   We didn't think that was possible.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.700]   But you know, the name of the game
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.180]   in corporate America is growth.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.300]   I mean, whether you wanna grow or not, you've gotta grow,
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.860]   especially if you're a public company.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.940]   And you know, I think that's such an interesting thing
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.020]   about the Mac now, is now that the technology is caught up,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.180]   now that there's enough of a base to make it interesting.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.260]   There's a, we're gonna see, I think we're gonna see
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.220]   all kinds of things, where this is gonna be
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.540]   where the growth is.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.220]   And you know, and as a company, you, I think a smart company
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.060]   tends to look not at the thing that's just profitable
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.100]   right now.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.460]   You know, this is why it's so interesting
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.940]   to compare Apple to Microsoft in terms of growth,
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.180]   rather than in terms of just straight dollars.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.180]   'Cause the trend lines are really interesting,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.300]   when you look at growth rather than just straight dollars.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.420]   I also think that as you look at communities
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.260]   and systems that are like steam,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.660]   when you start adding the efficiencies that those allow,
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.300]   of having people who are, you know, you have the entire
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.900]   community of people who are willing to pay for it.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.980]   And people, you can start lowering the cost,
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.020]   'cause a lot of what we pay for is piracy,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.260]   the inefficiency, shipping, you know, advertising.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.580]   As we get more and more people in that community,
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.980]   a company can become more efficient if they want to,
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.180]   by making it less expensive and thereby lowering
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.220]   the incentive to pirate it.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.500]   Because, you know, that's what they're kind of overcoming
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.340]   by the price.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.180]   If it was efficient, if everyone would pay something for it,
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.420]   they could make it a lot less, you know, cost a lot less,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.340]   if they were thinking kind of long-term
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.780]   and not short-term as far as their quarterly reports.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.460]   - Yep.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.300]   - Yep.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.580]   (laughing)
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.420]   Sorry.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.260]   - Yep.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.340]   - All right, follow that one under,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.340]   don't get me started.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.820]   - Don't get me started.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.660]   - So I'm just checking.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.820]   - Let's figure out how to make my stuff harder to get.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   - I'm just checking the $91,000 Oscar gift bag.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.220]   $91,000?
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.300]   - Well, part of it is because there's like a $85,000
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.380]   African safari with a personal chef in it,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.860]   a $14,500 stay in Monaco.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.380]   - Is it the same personal chef, Leo,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.620]   or will they have to, I mean, he'll be doing a lot of trouble.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.300]   - You have to share it with Jeff or Aniston, apparently.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.580]   No, anybody who goes to like presenters, losers,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.780]   not obviously everybody in the audience.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.260]   - You said?
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.660]   - But everybody goes up on stage, I guess, probably.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.500]   - Gets one.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.340]   - Gets one.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.180]   - That makes sense.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.020]   - And here's an interesting prize,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.700]   a $7,000 trip to Connecticut.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.660]   - That's the one that you are?
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.500]   - No one asked me.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.340]   - I would have been by New York.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.420]   - I would have bundled our software in there.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.700]   I would have just said, you know, here, I'm a deep man.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.900]   - Well, the reason I'm looking is 'cause usually
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.300]   there is an Apple product or two in there.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.940]   Let's see, gift carts for online shopping,
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.860]   gourmet chocolate, indoor skydiving,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.820]   experience and fitness classes, what a lot of crap.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.140]   Free altoids.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:53.900]   - Also known as Brian Austin Green's personal assistant gift bag.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.860]   - Yeah.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.180]   - I know, I do know one person who works for somebody
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.300]   who is like kind of a high profile holiday person
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.340]   who gets these gift bags.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.220]   And he always, every time he reads something like that
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.460]   on gawk, or he's like, okay, I wonder if this Christmas
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.460]   I'll be getting the body bath gel or the set of $80 oven mitts
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.020]   or the, I bet I'm not gonna get the offerings so far
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.860]   or the iPhone because--
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.500]   - We like to call it trickle down economics.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.340]   - Yeah.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.180]   - It's a regift bag.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.180]   - Regift bag.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.100]   Well, here's what you might be getting.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.140]   Electronic cigarettes, I think that's,
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.540]   we'll give those to Andy.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.780]   - They're better because they're digital.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.620]   - They're digital.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.460]   - They're fingers.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.100]   - Red eye removal surgery worth $8,800 bucks.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.100]   (laughing)
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.780]   I think we have cameras to do that now.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.140]   - There's a plugin for that I think.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.580]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.580]   Premium gaming apparel.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.860]   - You're just making these up.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.100]   - No, I'm not this.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.380]   No, I wish I were this from the Daily Beast.com.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.700]   - Okay, so I just wanna be clear.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.180]   There's two axes here that I wanna explore.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.700]   First of all, there's a close you wear to play a game
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.700]   and then you can buy nice ones.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.140]   - This is close to where--
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.340]   - Medium gaming apparel.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.540]   - They're in the very comfortable ones.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.420]   - Hey, if you're gonna play for 16 hours straight
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.260]   without going to the bathroom, there is some gear that you need.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.100]   That's all I'm thinking.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.460]   - Yeah, sure, you want the catheter suit.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.780]   I understand that you're using your video game chair
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.620]   and with your catheter suit.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.620]   - We don't like to call it the catheter suit.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.700]   We like to call it the necessary equipment.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.660]   - I think there was a little upset
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.020]   because at the Golden Globe Awards,
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.860]   they handed out pigs, micro pigs, small,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.380]   really small pigs, but you had to attend
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.340]   an hour long seminar on how to--
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.980]   - On how to care for the pig.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.300]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.460]   But I don't see-- - You're not making a mess.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.900]   - You know, traditionally the iPod was a very popular item.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.740]   There's a flip cam.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.100]   I just, I don't see any apples to it.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.060]   I think what you should try to do, Leo,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.420]   is like get those like a Twit, like window vinyl clings.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.260]   - There you go. - You try to get those
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.740]   to get those in. - So that's like
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.260]   the $30,000 cruise, $80,000 diamond-studded wristwatch.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.740]   Oh, and some sort of Twit logo, cling, wind go cling.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.300]   If that winds up on the online, that's good publicity, sir.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.580]   That's $18 well spent for the whole thing.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.420]   (laughing)
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.220]   - I think so, unless it's a regift.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.020]   - Spend money to make money.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.580]   - April 3rd, that, you know,
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.940]   they should have put iPads in there.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.540]   - Yeah, wouldn't that have been a great--
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.820]   (laughing)
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.060]   - Well, maybe they don't have any.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.420]   - That would have gotten me a little bit upset.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.860]   - Now, why Andy, are you waiting for your iPad?
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.300]   - It's not April 3rd, so yes, I'm waiting for my iPad.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.220]   - You're not gonna get an early edition, hint, hint.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.060]   - I don't know.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.620]   - If you did, you couldn't tell us.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.540]   - If I did, then I'd be like polishing my, like,
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.860]   you know, Charles Nelson-Rally.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.100]   (laughing)
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.100]   I can tell you definitively that I do not have an iPad
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.460]   and that I do not know if I will be getting one early.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.740]   - Do you know if anybody has one?
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.660]   - Does a Walt or David or Wally or Fred or--
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.820]   - Don't answer, don't answer, Andy,
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.180]   don't answer, he's trying to trick you.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.540]   - Well, David usually takes his kids out to play dates
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.260]   on Tuesdays from two to eight.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.180]   I was there in his house last week
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.660]   and he's a little bit behind on his Netflix returns.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.180]   There's a Bree in the fridge that's going to go a little bit
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.260]   gaming, I didn't see any evidence of an iPad.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.940]   - Oh, dear, dear, dear.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.060]   - You can't cut a better source than a David Pokes donker.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.900]   - Yeah.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.740]   (clearing throat)
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.580]   You know, Steve was at the Oscars.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.580]   - Did he have an iPad?
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.060]   - Keep you track of it?
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.980]   - I don't know, let's see.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.900]   - Oh, well, he really was.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.380]   - He's not wearing a funny hat.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.180]   - Well, he's just--
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.580]   - It's funny thing is he's got a turtleneck on him
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.420]   to do there.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.780]   It looks like he's wearing a dinner jacket
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.940]   based on the other guy. - He's a nice dinner jacket.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.860]   Fits beautifully, he actually looks pretty good.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.700]   - That's fantastic.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.260]   - And he's got the security goons right there next to him.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   Or maybe that's an Israeli producer, it could be either.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.660]   (laughing)
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.500]   - I don't know which--
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.540]   - Yes, most producers are X-Massad.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.660]   - I think that's definitely Massad, whoever it is,
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.500]   is Massad. - It's like a hard part
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   of the-- - It's just gilled over there,
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.660]   you have to, you know.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.900]   - Don't mess with Massad.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.780]   - Here's a knife and three toothpicks.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.860]   (laughing)
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.380]   How many border guards can you take out?
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.220]   - He actually looks pretty good.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.340]   - No, he was a Pixar.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.580]   - And then--
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.900]   - So he's-- - But it was nominated.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.220]   - Wasn't that a little bit of a surprise though?
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.420]   Doesn't he like not want to go out for these sort of things?
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.180]   Because, you know, and it's got the impression
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.180]   that he only will do an event where there's gonna be lots
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.980]   of photographers and lots of publicity
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.140]   if he can promote Apple's businesses there?
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.100]   - Well. - Or it could just simply be a case
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.540]   of he just wants to support the film
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.100]   and support the people who work for a better business.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.140]   - But think about it now, what is Steve's big push right now?
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.180]   Where's he been lately?
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.140]   Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.620]   He's pushing content.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.340]   - Ooh, he's got to, he's got to start mixing.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.580]   - He's got to have to start actually talking to him.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.660]   - I think this has something to do.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.900]   You know, so you're absolutely right
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.580]   that Steve is very focused on his business.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.740]   - And this is his business right now.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   - That's what I'm doing. - He owns 7% of Disney.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.660]   - Yeah.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.140]   - But I don't think he's there as a mogul or to hobnob.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.420]   I think he's, he's, I think you're exactly right.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.260]   I think he's trying to--
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.260]   - Well, the truth is, I mean, like, you know,
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.340]   not to be too meta about this,
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.780]   but just showing up at the Oscars, you know,
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.620]   of course we got a new T-Vos
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.060]   so we could record the Oscars.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.380]   We, we watched the whole thing,
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.500]   the red carp at the whole night.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.900]   - I love it. - The coverage is insane.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.740]   - I love it.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.500]   I just, I'm sorry, I know it's trashy.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.980]   - But it's the thing, I'm saying it's publicity too.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.500]   It is, it is, I mean, I know he doesn't need the publicity,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.580]   but you know, as he moves closer and closer into the,
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.980]   if you like kind of consumer mainstream,
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.660]   you know, just showing up there, you know,
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.660]   and also, I mean, in fairness,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.460]   he does have that other company that he works with.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.660]   So it is, perspective, it's insane.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.860]   - And it wasn't nominated for,
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.380]   it did win a best animated film.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.220]   - It did, didn't it?
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.500]   - Yeah. - It didn't, it was nominated
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.660]   in the best picture as well.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.940]   - Yeah. - First time, I think,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.780]   in a while on that.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.940]   - It would sound knowing how people at Pixar,
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.580]   I've done a lot of talks at a lot of places and,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.420]   there's four or five that really stick out in my mind
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.620]   in terms of the employees that I met,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.580]   but by an order of magnitude,
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.700]   Pixar is like wall to wall with incredibly intense people
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.260]   who care deeply about doing great work.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.860]   I've never met anybody on the level of even,
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.860]   whatever you do at Pixar,
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.300]   whether you're like cleaning up trays,
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.940]   everybody there is completely engaged.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.500]   And I wonder if it would kind of also send
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.820]   kind of a bad message, you know what I mean?
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.460]   In a place, at a place that really where people care
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.580]   that much if the head dude wasn't there
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.140]   to celebrate on their behalf, you know?
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.380]   - Yeah, maybe, but I wonder if he's been there in the past,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.020]   I mean, they've been nominated many times.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.700]   You know, John Lasseter was featured, they did,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.140]   - Right, in the best short subject,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.860]   there was a pack, there was like a little mini-document package
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.740]   in which established directors talked about
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.820]   the importance of short films,
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.180]   and John Lasseter was part of that package.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.180]   - Yeah, it was really neat.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.620]   It was really nicely done, I thought.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.980]   - You see, I think of the shorts and documentaries,
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.700]   I think nine out of 10 were using Final Cut.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.500]   - Nine out of 10 used Final Cut.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.540]   - What was the 10th?
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.380]   - Sure was Evan.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.740]   - Who doesn't use, I mean, you think Evan?
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.500]   - Oh no, yeah, it's scissors.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.140]   - Yeah, yeah, right, glue.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.980]   - Dave, I lost my tape.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.300]   - What's up, Ben called Alex the big thing,
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.700]   the hamburger mister, what's it called,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.420]   the giant machine these two edit films with?
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.260]   - Oh, I just, the sinning.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.660]   - That's before my time.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.260]   - No, my pal's were in film school,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.540]   they had to go to the giant machine,
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.740]   the giant machine for it, yeah.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.940]   - I, in my time, it was all audio,
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.900]   since I was in a radio station,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.780]   it was a lot of war, war, war, war,
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.260]   to find the beat, but that was about all I had to worry about.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.900]   - Credit to Jim Dowerimple at CNET,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.620]   he went and actually talked to a lot of these filmmakers.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.940]   He says to talk to Matthew O'Neill,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.740]   director of China as a natural disaster,
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.260]   the tears of Sichuan Province, one of the nominated pictures.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.980]   He says, "No, Neil says we switched over entirely
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.100]   "to Final Cut Pro and forced any holdout editors
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.380]   "to switch to because it made more sense economically
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.580]   "and allowed us to do everything we need."
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.980]   - One of the things that Final Cut did early on
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.460]   that I think that Apple did early on with Final Cut
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.860]   is that they didn't restrict what resolution
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.460]   you could work at for a certain price.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   And I think this was where it really,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.220]   Avid kind of didn't make the switch fast enough,
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.220]   and they still really haven't made it to the way
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.060]   where they need it.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.280]   With a Final Cut, you can have uncompressed
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.020]   4, 4, 4, you know, HD for $1,300 plus the machine.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.940]   With an Avid, you know, it's a quarter million dollar
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.340]   nitrous system, I don't know if it is now,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.420]   but it used to be this huge expensive thing
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.220]   just to be able to edit HD and HD came on too quickly
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.780]   and Avid didn't react and Apple,
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.700]   that really caused a massive expansion.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.460]   And then of course, the real, when Cold Mountain
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.740]   was edited by Walter Murch, that was the beginning
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.020]   of the end because suddenly all these editors were like,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.380]   ooh, he's using, what is he using over there?
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.460]   And that gave it some legitimacy that it didn't have before.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.580]   And then it's just a matter of the economics
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.620]   that just make way more sense.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.100]   - Dan Wilkin, the online editor of Food Incorporated said,
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.940]   Final Cut Pro can do almost everything
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.340]   the million dollar systems can do
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.700]   and it costs you below 15 grand,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.900]   including the cost of the Mac, Final Cut, and video cards.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.100]   Truth is, for several projects I've worked on,
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.020]   we could do everything with the same gear you use at home.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.620]   - Yeah, that's significant.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.460]   I mean, that's huge.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.500]   - I mean, that's what's happening across the board.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.780]   - By the way, Final Cut Pro, not quite 50% market share
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.420]   in the nonlinear, edited space.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.140]   - Better than Avid.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.500]   - Well, and Avid's more expensive.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.780]   Avid will say that they're not trying to get
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.340]   to the same number of people.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.980]   What they want is the, they still really cater.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.020]   And to be fair to Avid, I still don't think
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.580]   Final Cut handles large numbers of what we call objects
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.420]   very well.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.780]   So you tend to break up a large Final Cut project.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.220]   One that, you know, you break it up into reels
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.460]   because with an Avid, you know, we had,
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.700]   - You could do the whole movie in one project.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.900]   - Well, in all the extra takes, I mean,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   there was a movie that I worked on
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.500]   that had 750,000 objects in one project.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.940]   And I would hesitate to put more than 10,000
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.740]   into a Final Cut project, one Final Cut project.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.180]   And so now admittedly the Avid wasn't built for the 750,000
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.420]   and it actually crashed once a day,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.540]   but 150,000 is pretty, 100, 150,000 is what it's really
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.380]   specked for.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   And Final Cut, you really can't do that.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.940]   So you really have to think about breaking the movie up
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.300]   into scenes and into reels and so on and so forth
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.620]   so that you, in the smaller sections
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.820]   in Final Cut, in my opinion, to efficiently work.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.180]   So one may know more than I do,
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.300]   but we have found that we put that much in
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.860]   and things get real heavy.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.860]   - We're gonna take a break just a bit.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.220]   We'll talk a little bit about the first iPad commercial,
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.380]   which also happened to be on the Oscars
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.980]   in just a second before we go much farther,
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.660]   though I do want to mention our friends at Citrix,
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.860]   the makers of GoToMeeting, that great online meeting software
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.940]   that makes it so easy for you to avoid business travel
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.660]   and yet get more done.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.620]   I bet you a lot of movies are done with GoToMeeting.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.180]   I mean, what a great way to collaborate,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.620]   to work together for product demos
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.780]   and sales presentations too for training.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.980]   Any kind of conference call is more visual,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.140]   more effective and more affordable
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.180]   'cause you don't have to do that expensive business travel.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.020]   My first GoToMeeting was up and running in minutes.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.220]   Of course, I didn't really remember that
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.300]   'cause I've been using it for so long.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.140]   You can try it right now.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.660]   You could see how fast you can get it running
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.140]   before we're done, I'm sure you'll have it.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.220]   It takes a minute.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.580]   Go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.140]   By the way, this is free for 30 days.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.540]   If you decide to buy after your 30-day trial,
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.940]   $49 a month for as many meetings as you want
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.020]   as long as you want and that includes free teleconferencing,
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.260]   both phone and voiceover internet, free.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:05.100]   Gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.460]   I love it, I know you're gonna love it
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.060]   and I think you'll think of a lot of ways to use it.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.260]   So give it a try.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.340]   Gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.980]   So finally, ads for the iPad.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.820]   Coming.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.580]   Anything to say about that?
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.540]   You wanna see it?
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.380]   Let's see them.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.220]   Let's take a look.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.380]   Let's go to the video.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.540]   There were two of them, right?
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.300]   This is the first one that's on YouTube.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.580]   Let me get the high resolution version.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.620]   So they're showing the bookstore,
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.100]   they're showing the film, they're showing the Google Maps.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.260]   There's a reader.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.260]   I mean, it's really going very quickly.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.500]   It's only 30 seconds.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.500]   And I think the point of it,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.260]   the thing that I get from it is that it's more about,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.260]   look at all the things it can do.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.820]   Yeah, I think it really looks like
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.060]   they're not trying to sell this as an e-book reader
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:00.980]   or as a content device,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.980]   they're trying to plant that seed
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.140]   that this could be your next laptop.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.980]   And--
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.820]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.660]   I think so.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.060]   Also, I was anonymous, I swear to God,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.700]   anonymously invited to take part in a survey.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.300]   About Apple products, it was like an email survey.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   As someone who has registered in iMac,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.500]   would you like to take part in a survey?
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.380]   And of course, it's an alternative
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.860]   to actually having to sit down and write things.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.340]   When you, anytime you're given a survey to do,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.140]   you know that the first third of the questions
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:29.940]   don't mean anything,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.620]   the last third of the questions almost don't mean anything.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.740]   They're usually just trying to figure out
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.860]   who is giving us the answers to this questions
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.740]   that we really want.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.300]   And the important ones are always sandwiched in the middle.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.780]   And there was a set of questions
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.180]   that's all about attitudes about the iPad,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.860]   about do you see this as a business tool?
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.340]   Do you, have you spent this much money on business things?
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.260]   How many people are running in your business?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.500]   Was the last time you traveled and did you take,
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.060]   what sort of stuff did you take?
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.460]   There seemed to be a real focus on
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.300]   not how interested am I in the iPad
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   as a movie viewer and as a music player
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.460]   and as a game machine
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.420]   and how interested am I in something
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.140]   that could compete with a $500 Windows Notebook.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.980]   - Right.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.820]   - Huh, that's interesting.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.660]   'Cause that's, boy, that's not the space I'd wanna compete in,
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.100]   especially with now Microsoft
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.060]   and the Courier looking more real.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.700]   That's the two screen booklet thing.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.420]   And then HP's got a slate.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.660]   I mean, there's a lot of companies going out
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.420]   to me in that computer space.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.820]   - Well, we should talk about all three of those
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.940]   because those are interesting,
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.580]   very different, very interesting demos.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.580]   Courier is still just a flash animation
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.780]   of something that may or may not really exist.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.420]   I thought that was one of the oddest demo videos
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.260]   I've ever seen because I am the biggest nerd ever.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.340]   I will see the potential in just about anything
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.860]   because if it's new and interesting
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.060]   and has a different approach,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.740]   but even the whole demo was about,
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.700]   I'm a interior designer.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.060]   I've just got this new contract.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.780]   It will be the focus of my life for the next three months.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.700]   So I'm gonna create a new notebook.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.020]   This fabric looks okay.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.700]   I think I'll take a copy of that for my notebook journal.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.660]   And it was great if you were in the business
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.260]   of being an interior designer.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.660]   It didn't communicate the idea that anybody
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.380]   who uses handheld digital devices
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.780]   can find a use for this thing,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.580]   which is exactly what the point of the iPad video was.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.020]   They're not there to tell you,
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.580]   they weren't showing you a single use construct.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.900]   They're trying to give you enough imagery
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.300]   and enough information to make you think
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.420]   that no matter what it is that you do,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.300]   you will be able to find a use for the iPad in your life.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.340]   - I still think, I think that the big thing for the iPad
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.860]   is a laptop for people who don't want or need
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.340]   the complexity of an operating system.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.620]   And I don't think that the Windows 7's kind of right.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.380]   - And that's the issue is this.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.500]   - I take it back, career is not.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.220]   Career is the Zoon OS.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.100]   Career is Windows Phone 7
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.700]   on a different kind of hardware platform.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.420]   - It looks like it's based on,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.620]   the Zoon operating system I believe is based
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.740]   on Windows CE as a matter of fact.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.780]   But with just a lot of really cool things added on to it.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.620]   - It's like QI.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.380]   - And a lot of great hardware, right, that makes it work.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.860]   And last week, I think we talked a lot about how really cool
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.860]   the new Windows Phone operating system looks like.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   I'm giving them 10 points out of 10
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.620]   for going a different way.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.540]   I think the courier could be a really cool tool
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.060]   if they had the guts to commit to the idea of,
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.740]   we don't want to build a new laptop,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.300]   we don't want to build a new media reader.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.820]   We want to build a digital version of electronic journal.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.780]   That'll be perfect for anybody who needs to collect.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.420]   - That's kind of what this is.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.820]   - Right, so if they stick to that
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.580]   as opposed to trying to then say,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.980]   then if you use the bottom screen,
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.060]   turns into the keyboard,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.620]   the top screen turns into an op-acadocument window,
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.220]   you can run a mobile version of Office.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.540]   I don't know if that's going to work.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.780]   - They do say that like Apple,
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.420]   they're going to do dedicated apps,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.940]   not quite a few dedicated apps for the courier platform.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.540]   It's supposedly running the Tegra 2,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.220]   which is a very nice, powerful system on a chip.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.180]   It's impressive, but you know, these are, as you say,
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.740]   Andy, these are not even prototypes.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.140]   These are flash videos.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.700]   - Yeah, and the other thing to cut my eye
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.420]   is that it even seemed kind of cumbersome that you have
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.740]   a white silhouette of a hand like holding a stylus.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.660]   This sort of backs up the comment that Bill Gates said earlier
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.180]   that I'm not impressed by the eye-pags.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.340]   I think that you're going to need a stylus
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.660]   to make real use out of a tablet.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.780]   And you can just see all the different places
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.340]   where the little cartoon hand has to switch between
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.300]   tapping things with her fingers
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.740]   and actually having to basically have to twirl
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.980]   the thing in her fingers in order to get back the stylus
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.980]   so as to get them right things by hand.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.140]   So I'm not sure how well that will actually work.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.540]   That doesn't really grab me as,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.140]   I really want to spend an hour switching between tapping
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.260]   and dragging and having to hand write
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.900]   different notes and different things.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.940]   - One note's very popular with students though.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.180]   I mean, Microsoft does have a--
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.020]   - It's popular with everybody.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.900]   I know I know reporters that just swear about it.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.740]   - Yeah.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.660]   And so this, if this has a, I'm sure it will,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.740]   a one note like application running on it.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.540]   - I think still the A-in or Pound Gorilla
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.060]   is still an iTunes music store.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.900]   - Yeah. - Or the iTunes store
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.740]   is that the iPad is going to connect
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.220]   to 100,000 applications in the--
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.100]   - But remember, Microsoft does have the Zoom marketplace
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.260]   and it's pretty sophisticated, pretty nice,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.860]   and it has as many songs.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.300]   - There's many songs, I mean, I'm talking about the applications.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.500]   You know, the thing is, you know,
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.980]   the thing is is that there's a pipeline
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.540]   that's already built up in that area
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.260]   and that's going to be the real challenge.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.100]   - And I--
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.660]   - I saw something really different in that commercial,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.500]   I guess.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.580]   I saw what, if we're thinking of it as movie trailers,
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.860]   like a lot of times you'll see a movie trailer
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.220]   for like a chick flick and it really,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.180]   the idea is to tell you what the story is.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.100]   That was like a trailer for a Michael Bay film.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.700]   They just want to show you how cool the stuff is
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.340]   that blows up. - The iPad one.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.340]   - Yeah, and what they ended up showing in that is,
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.580]   I saw two levels of stuff going on in that.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.060]   No matter who you are, no matter how much you know
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.380]   about what this thing is,
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.460]   as long as you believe credibly that that is a real demo,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.700]   it's mind-blowing. - Yeah.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.740]   - Just because of the speed and just the sense of like,
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.780]   they really get you that sense of affordance,
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.740]   as Jacob Nielsen would say,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.980]   that you can just grab stuff,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.700]   sort of like you're saying when changing the styluses.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.060]   So on two levels, on the one hand,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.620]   if you're an iPhone user and a group
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.100]   or mention this once, everybody does this, right?
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.980]   You grab your iPhone and you're at the top of the page
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.220]   and you're reading and you just start doing that thing
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.140]   where it goes, "Fluka, fluka, fluka."
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.780]   Just 'cause it's fun to do.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.060]   You know, you do this in Tweety
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.220]   and it makes a clicky noise and loads more tweets.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.780]   It's really fun to use that interface.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.100]   And if you see that as an iPhone user,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.820]   you're gonna be like, "Hell yeah, I'm gonna buy one."
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.780]   But if you're not an iPhone user and you don't know that,
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.260]   boy, that feels really different than your newbie
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   or your chubby or like,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.900]   now when I use my newbie or my chubby,
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.580]   I feel like I'm wearing like boxing gloves
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.780]   and trying to punch numbers.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.100]   - Right. - You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.180]   - No, I'm with you. - I'm with you.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.140]   - I'm with you. - That was all sizzle, you know?
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.300]   - But you gotta say, like, you open up a Kindle
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.860]   and you immediately touch the screen and you go, "Erm."
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.980]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.340]   - Alex, first hour I had a Kindle,
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.740]   I thought it was defective.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.580]   (laughs)
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.220]   - The game's just-- - The screen doesn't work.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.340]   - It was absolutely true. - It was absolutely true.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.100]   I was getting a briefing a few months ago
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.140]   from Sony about their entire e-book line
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.580]   and they have touch models and non-touch models.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.900]   And after like going through a more affordable ones
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.020]   that don't do touch, going through the touch models
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.340]   and going back to the non-touch ones,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.060]   you just instinctively wanna tap parts of the screen.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.500]   You know, and so that's a pretty big deal.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.900]   But I really do think that my initial read on this is pretty,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.420]   I'm sticking to my initial read,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.620]   which is that Apple really wants to make sure that,
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.020]   no matter who comes through the Apple store
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.500]   to take a look at an iPad,
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.060]   they will be able to sell them an iPad
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.060]   for whatever use case they're gonna present to them.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.860]   - That's my thinking. - It's like C3P is saying--
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.340]   - People will find use for this.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.500]   It's one of those things that's like, anytime,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.980]   it's one reason I kind of have a beef
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.100]   with these productivity tools
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.060]   that are like a fricking pinball machine.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.500]   People like using them.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.420]   And if there's a tool that you enjoy using,
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   whether or not it ends up being,
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.620]   and this is not a criticism, it's just an observation,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.780]   but like you will find reasons to use it.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.140]   Whether or not, it's like sort of like
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.620]   the nail and hammer analogy.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.540]   I totally agree with you,
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.820]   I think people are gonna see this thing,
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.460]   I think it's the Starbucks scenario.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.060]   People are gonna see people flying around
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.980]   and pages flipping by and all this stuff.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.820]   And regardless of what any of us think about
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.420]   how usable that might be,
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.260]   they're gonna see that.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.100]   And they're just gonna be like,
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.300]   that is minority report.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.620]   That is the coincidence.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.740]   I'm gonna be four hours on a plane the day after
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.340]   the iPad ships flying to Boulder
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.820]   for the Congress on World Affairs.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.940]   I am pretty much resigned to the fact
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.420]   that I'm not gonna be able to sleep on that flight
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.180]   because I'm gonna be giving iPad demos
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.980]   to the entire cabin for all four and a half hours.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.540]   - That's the best thing about owning a new thing
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.300]   is that you get to show off in the plane.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.980]   You kinda hope you get to go to the plane
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.820]   so you can show off.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.220]   - I don't know flight attendant.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.140]   I'm not sure if this empty mug
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.940]   that should have tequila in it will affect
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.500]   (laughing)
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   - Let's see if you can do it.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.460]   - This thing works a lot better
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.660]   if you put some little bottles at the culeons too.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.140]   - I could use it as a stand.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.100]   So the real test I think of the success of the iPad
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.700]   will be in the first week
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.900]   and how many you see in Starbucks.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.220]   And I predict you're gonna see,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.380]   they're gonna be like mushrooms.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.540]   They're gonna be popping on.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.660]   - I think the big question is really
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.660]   if Apple can make them.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.780]   - Yeah, 'cause I think that if they only get 300,000 out
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.860]   they'll sell all 300,000 in the first day.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.540]   And so then it's just a matter of,
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.980]   I've committed to buying three
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.300]   because we're giving one for myself.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.220]   And then on Twitch on Sunday we picked a random person.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   - That's great.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   - You know, 'cause Conan did it.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.980]   And he got 15, this random woman,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.900]   he just picked her and got 15,500 followers.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.180]   So Kevin Rose and I said,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.420]   well, maybe we could do that ourselves.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.300]   So Kevin picked a random,
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.060]   he did a search for I Hate Technology.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.900]   And found a woman who had just joined Twitter
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.220]   who had three followers, two posts,
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   the second of which was I Hate Technology.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.700]   So we said, oh, everybody follow her.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.220]   She's in New Zealand.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.860]   And I started to feel guilty when I realized
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   that she's now received 13,242 unsolicited emails
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.220]   from Twitter saying we're following you.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.580]   And so I said, well, we're gonna give her an iPad,
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.340]   even though we'll have to buy it here
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.060]   and ship it to you. - Sure, so you can read 'em.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.540]   - And then we're gonna give one of these followers
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.020]   at random we'll pick and we'll give them an iPad.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.420]   So Lisa tickled Pink if you wanna get in on this.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.020]   We'll announce a winner, we'll find a winner
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.380]   and announce it on April 3rd.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.180]   - She decides to use it as a cheese board.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.340]   I'm gonna be so happy.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.060]   - No, I talked to her this morning in New Zealand.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.660]   She got on the Kiwi FM WAMO radio in New Zealand
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.900]   and I talked to her.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.820]   And she's a very nice design student
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.580]   at a university in New Zealand.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.620]   She created the account 'cause her instructors said,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.420]   okay, everybody has to try social media, create an account.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.660]   And she said, I thought I broke it
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.180]   when I started getting all these emails.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.660]   I couldn't, I don't know what happened.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.060]   And I said, I am so sorry,
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.460]   I really should have warned you ahead of time.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.700]   But she's very happy about it.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.260]   She's really happy about getting an iPad.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.060]   I think that took a lot of this thing out of it.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.820]   - And then my professor said, oh, come on,
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.700]   I've gotten like 40,000 of those.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.980]   You've just won a free email,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.020]   click email of the iPad, everybody got just deleted.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.100]   - Just deleted, forget it.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   So 13,242 followers right now.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.780]   There's only 50,000 Twitter users in all of New Zealand.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.140]   So I think we're gonna get everybody in New Zealand
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:54.980]   to follow her anyway.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.980]   Lisa Tikold Pink, if you want to follow her
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.060]   and get in on that iPad giveaway.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.260]   Let's take a break, come back with more.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.700]   You're listening to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.940]   Andy Anaco is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.180]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth from 43folders.com
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.660]   and the fabulous, funny, you look nice today,
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.300]   podcast Mr. Merlin Mann and Alex Lindsey,
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.220]   who hosts about 8,000 podcasts
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.460]   on Pixelcorpixelcorp.tv.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.060]   Back to the conversation in a moment before we do though,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.620]   I would like very much to mention our good friends
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.460]   at Squarespace.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.780]   In fact, you know, Dane went out to Squarespace headquarters
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.300]   in New York City.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.340]   They're beautiful Soho offices
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.500]   and went and met some of the Squarespace people.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.940]   And I thought we'd be kind of fun for you
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.140]   to get to meet them as well.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.780]   So here is our first look into the Squarespace office.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.540]   - My name is Anthony Costlinan.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.180]   I'm the founder of Squarespace.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.780]   I started Squarespace about six and a half years ago
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.860]   from my dorm room.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.220]   I started it originally because I needed a website for myself.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.860]   It was originally just my homepage
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.380]   and I wanted to have a blog, a photo gallery,
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.500]   a couple of pages, statistics system,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.780]   and I wanted to be able to update it really easily.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.500]   And I found that there was one or two programs
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.140]   that would let you do one fragment of that,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.700]   but there was nothing that would let you do all of it
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.540]   in one package.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.140]   And I'm really sensitive to interface and all that.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.620]   And I really didn't like when I put all those programs together
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.220]   how disjoint the interface was,
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.140]   how I had to go to all these different vendors.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.780]   So that was the original incarnation of Squarespace.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.580]   Just trying to solve that problem.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.860]   And through doing that, I think when you end up
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.540]   binding together certain features like that
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.980]   into a unified platform that's hosted,
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.940]   you get these kind of unexpected side effects
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.780]   that are very, very good.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.300]   Like for instance, if you've got one system
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.220]   that manages your statistics and your website,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.300]   that statistics platform can know more
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.740]   about what's happening on your website
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.540]   than if you were to just dump in Google Analytics.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.620]   Or if membership systems are unified
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.980]   against multiple platforms like your photo gallery
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.460]   and your blog and other things,
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.820]   you end up being able to do much more with those packages
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.380]   than if they weren't integrated.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.300]   - Anthony is really one of the great people at Squarespace.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.020]   They do such a good job.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.140]   If you have, this is, these are their beautiful offices
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.180]   for people watching on video.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.340]   I mean, really is spectacular.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.940]   If you would like to set up a website
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.100]   with just the most amazing server,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.060]   the most amazing software, the most amazing technology,
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.140]   I wanna give you a chance to do that.

[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.860]   you could actually go to squarespace.com right now,

[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.740]   - Better buy it.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.580]   - Yeah, you usually don't.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.380]   - Oh, anytime we think of, oh, we're gonna do an insight,
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.340]   we're like, yeah, and we'll, let's get an insight.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.940]   - We're converting the tech eyesight over.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.780]   We did our inside-twit blog over there.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.740]   I mean, it's just really great.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.380]   - Well, it's just so great to be able to a whizzy wig
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.580]   get things behind it and just have it done.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.860]   - Anthony really, it's neat to hear the story.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.140]   Because it's cool and started it.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.740]   Then they've made a great company out of it.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.540]   squarespace.com/macbreak,
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.500]   use the promo code MACBreak if you decide to sign up.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.180]   It's a little as $8 a month, but you'll get 10% off,
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.980]   which if you only do the $8 a month, is only 80 cents.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.180]   But, (laughs)
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.980]   so it's really not such a great deal, come to think of it.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.060]   But 10% is 10%, it adds up.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.900]   - Yes.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.260]   - You know, that's $9.60 a year.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.460]   - You're gonna get a back?
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.340]   - You're not made of money.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.060]   - Yeah, exactly, I mean, you have some other coffees.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.540]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.020]   squarespace.com/macbreak,

[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.820]   Moving right along.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.420]   What else is going on in the MAC Awards?
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.780]   - Oh, the Oscars, I was gonna talk, let's see.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.820]   No, we did that.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.220]   We talked about the iPad announcement.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.420]   - Do the iPad announcement.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.540]   Gentlemen, if you got anything to say for yourselves,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.900]   are they still there?
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.220]   - No, no, I'm looking at the--
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.060]   - Yeah, I'm looking at the--
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   - The stores. - Yeah.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.060]   - It's funny.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.340]   - Usually, we talk about the new MAC Heist.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.660]   - Oh, you know, and this is the last day, when is it in?
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.500]   - Is it the last day?
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.140]   It's tomorrow, I think.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.260]   - I was gonna make it my pick,
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.980]   but you know what, we should probably mention it.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.940]   We've talked to Philip Ryu before about MAC Heist.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.500]   There was a little bit of concern about it.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.700]   Was it John Grubber that was a little critical of MAC Heist?
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.060]   Because it seemed like it was just too good a deal.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.980]   This is an amazing deal.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.580]   The latest one is $20 for just a bunch of stuff,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.140]   including a number of things we've recommended,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.140]   like Andy, you recommended Rip It.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.700]   That's $20 by itself.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.740]   - Well, I've made my piece with it.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.260]   I've decided it's Walmart. - Are you okay with it?
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.620]   - It's Walmart, well, no, I'm not.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.980]   I think it's Walmart for MAC indie developers.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.500]   You can't afford to do it and you can't afford not.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.820]   - You can't afford not to do it.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.700]   - And it's like if you read the stores about Snapper
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.860]   or of Lassick or any of the companies that work decades
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.180]   to build a brand, and they're like,
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.900]   "Well, I gotta go make a version for this,
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.140]   "that doesn't actually make me that much money,
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.700]   "but it's gotta be in that store."
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.020]   So I mean, it's nothing, you know, particularly against them.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.020]   - It's a very powerful marketing tool.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.860]   - And the thing is, the thing that we got wrong,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.580]   I think, in sort of the telling of the story before,
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.500]   was that nobody had a gun in their head to do it.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.340]   - Right.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.180]   - And they knew what they were getting
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.020]   or not getting out of it.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.660]   And the people who don't wanna do it don't do it now.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.620]   And the people who do do do.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.820]   And it's just a question of where you are in your business.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.060]   And if you're bootstrapping and you have the opportunity
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.940]   to get your product in front of all those people.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.180]   - Yeah, I don't think those checks are insignificant either.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.260]   For a lot, especially it's probably the biggest signal
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.540]   for a little. - Especially for Phil.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.820]   - So I have Phil makes some money on it,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.980]   but you know, he gives a lot of money to charity.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.860]   - Oh, well, you know.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860]   (laughs)
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.260]   I think that's so funny when people say it.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.780]   - Are there no prisons?
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.620]   Are there no work houses?
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.540]   (laughs)
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.700]   - It's like when it's like, and that's Simpsons,
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.980]   when Lisa's on the tour and what is it the woman says
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.900]   something like, you know, a percentage of all proceeds
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   go to charity and she goes, what percentage?
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   She goes zero.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.740]   (laughs)
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.780]   - That's a percentage.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.100]   So it's eight App's Mac Journal, Rippick, Clips,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.300]   Cover Scout, which is 40 bucks.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.500]   Flow, which we've talked about,
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.980]   Tales of Monkey Island, I didn't even know
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.460]   that was still around, Rapidweaver, which is fantastic.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.500]   They just added that 1995.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   Tweety will be unlocked when they get to 56,789 bundles.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.620]   Wow, they sell a lot of them.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.300]   So do some math.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   They've sold almost, let's say they've sold 50,000 bundles
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.300]   at 20 bucks, that's a million bucks, right?
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.580]   - Yes.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.080]   - And they're gonna give $258,000 to charity.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.080]   There's one day left.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.280]   Oh no, a quarter of a million to charity, that's not bad.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.320]   And how much do we, we don't know
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.920]   what the developers cut is, do we?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.760]   - We don't know.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.280]   - But even if the developers, let's say the developers
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.080]   get another quarter of a million, that still leaves Philip
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.160]   and his grew a half a million bucks.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.320]   Maybe the developers get more.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.800]   - Playing and marketing, I mean, you can't deny it.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.480]   The way it's, you know, it's really, it's brilliant.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.120]   And the way that it's got that kind of network effect to it,
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.960]   you know? - Right.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.160]   - And if it very serves, I think it doesn't automatically
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.280]   tweet when you buy it, doesn't it automatically--
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.640]   - Encourage you to, in which case you get air-bushed
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.280]   extreme tracks and burning monkey solitaire if you tweet.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.120]   And that's brilliant, of course.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.440]   Good marketing. - It's silly, yeah.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.280]   Yeah, it's really--
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   - They get better at it every year.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.440]   I mean, it's, you know, they keep on tying it all,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.400]   you know, tying it all in.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   And I think that for someone, if you're listening to the show,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.880]   I mean, 1995 for all these apps is a pretty good deal.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.360]   - No, I've resisted.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.920]   You've resisted. - I'm kind of with you, Merlin.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.240]   I feel dirty.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.640]   - I can't put my finger on it, Leo.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.480]   Bugs me, I'm sorry.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.240]   - I don't know what you mean. - It bugs me.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.680]   You know, and the thing is, there's this really neat thing
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.520]   you can do if you really want to give money into charity.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.960]   There's this thing you can do which is giving money to charity.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.320]   If that is due to charity, give it to charity.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.160]   - No, I agree with you on that.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.720]   - Just becomes a way of going, it's like this whole green thing.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.920]   It becomes this way to go like, oh, it's okay that I'm going
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   to go spend money on this thing because a portion of it
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.600]   goes to charity.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.400]   And it's like, I think that has become like the starving
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.840]   black child of, of like, you know, why we buy what we do.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.160]   And you know, why don't you just own it?
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   Why don't you just go buy it because you want to buy it?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.760]   I just, I really, you know, it's--
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.200]   - Well, I think Philip did this in--
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.000]   - And gave away a portion of charity
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.440]   that everybody would forgive the Gulags.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.400]   - Right.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.440]   - I think though that that's, Philip did that
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.880]   when he was getting-- - Okay.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.920]   We managed to avoid Godwin there.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.680]   - No, Stalin's good, Stalin's good.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.920]   - No, that's good.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.840]   It's called, "Golwin's Corollary."
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.760]   - Just pulled out at the last second, that was good.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.000]   - Like on now, I was thinking, Matt,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.240]   I don't think anybody is buying this package
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.240]   because they care about whatever causes
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.040]   are being helped by the bundle.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.000]   I think they're buying it because, hey, 20 bucks,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.880]   there are at least two apps there that I was thinking of buying
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.960]   and if I just get these four others for free,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.560]   that's still a good deal.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.360]   I mean, it's money for, it's, I keep coming back
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.760]   to something that an organizer told me about 10 years ago
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.840]   that said, getting money is better than not getting money.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   And the alternative for, if it's nice that some part
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.880]   of this is going towards a designated charity,
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.360]   that there has to be oversight
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.680]   and this is not gonna be a successful thing for them
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.920]   unless they make sure that they make it very, very clear
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.880]   at the very, very ends.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.440]   They're, well, here's how much money was raised.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.360]   Here's how much, what percentage of that went to charities.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.840]   Here are the charities we gave it to
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.640]   and here are how these charities have been ranked
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.160]   in terms of their ability to take the money
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.600]   that is given to them and turn it into social change
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.680]   or the programs that we're trying to apply.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.640]   - I just think that becomes, that becomes for businesses,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.080]   especially for corporations, that becomes grandma's funeral.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.200]   It's like every time somebody wants to say something
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.480]   and not be, not even wanna say criticized,
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.960]   but anytime somebody wants a free pass
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.680]   do whatever they want, you just say,
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.280]   oh, it's grandma's funeral, right?
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.880]   It's giving money to charity.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.000]   And it's like, that's so weak, you know?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.600]   - Okay, but have they ever said,
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.160]   it was just in reply to criticisms,
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.640]   not replying to the criticism itself,
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.440]   but saying, but hey, man, it's all for charity.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.160]   - No, every time, well, it's happening to clients.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.120]   - That's a valid point, if that's what they're doing.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.040]   - Well, I think it's a significant amount.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   I mean, I think there's a lot of companies
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.240]   that talk about 1% or 3% or whatever.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.760]   They're giving a pretty significant amount of money
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.240]   to charity, but I don't think people are doing it
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.080]   because of charity.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.280]   It makes them, everybody feel good.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.600]   They're saving a lot of money.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.120]   The thing is, is they're also a member
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.320]   that Photoshop did not become ubiquitous selling it 695
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.040]   or 795, which is what it came out at.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.760]   The retail was 695, 795, but the reason Photoshop
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.120]   became ubiquitous is because it sold OEM at $99
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.240]   or $100 to the scanner manufacturer.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.080]   - That's true.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.160]   - So the reason Photoshop is the standard today
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.720]   is because they sold it at one, at 15% the price,
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.040]   and it came free with every scanner that you had,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.600]   and now they own the market.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.360]   - And we look at this all the time.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.000]   We bundle stuff, we do sales,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.320]   we bundle stuff with our other stuff.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.680]   We do this all the time.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.840]   We would have been in the Mac Heist deal
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.120]   if they had sent us an email,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.080]   like as one of the unlocks for a $200,
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.040]   I would have done it in a heartbeat.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.720]   - What would you, how much money would you expect from it?
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.280]   - I don't, it's just another marketing,
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.600]   another making sure people know about our product.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.360]   I bet you we would get a check
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   for somewhere between 30 and 50,000.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.680]   - So you don't really care,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.400]   well that's actually not an insignificant amount of money,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.840]   but it's less than you'd get if you'd sold them,
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   and you wouldn't sell that.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.120]   - But you wouldn't, it's not a lost sale,
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.920]   it's a different opportunity,
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.000]   it's a different set of people that weren't buying it before.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.120]   And it's a one time, what makes it work
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.200]   is that it's a one time sale,
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.240]   it's not all the time, it comes out.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   People aren't gonna wait another year to buy a conduit.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.760]   The people are general clientele,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   aren't gonna wait another year.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.720]   Oh, I'm not gonna key anything,
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.240]   'cause I gotta wait for the next Mac Heist,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.040]   and they don't even know if we're gonna do it the next year.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.520]   - And so the thing is, is that, that's the issue.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.280]   - That's true, it doesn't cost you sales,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.120]   and it's not involved. - It's just,
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   it's a lot of people that aren't involved.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:00.960]   - The only problem is,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.800]   you also run into that thing
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.480]   with the 99 cent app race to the bottom kind of stuff,
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.560]   where I buy a lot of stuff on the iTunes store,
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   from my phone, and I'm starting to notice that,
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.800]   I mean, you guys probably noticed this a long time.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.080]   - The price are going up.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.480]   - Well, that, but also, there's a lot of apps
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.640]   that I'm kind of like, wow, I can't believe
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:20.280]   that's only 99 cents, but I think that 99 cents barrier
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   is, I guess 99 cents,
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.320]   that must be the least you can charge, right?
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.160]   - Yeah.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.520]   - Because wow, I mean, there are a lot of apps for 99 cents,
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.120]   because, you know what I mean?
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.320]   It's like, if you, that, you're gonna compete on volume,
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.840]   you're gonna get more volume at 99 cents than you are at $1.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.080]   But the other thing is, this is an engineering problem.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.560]   There's also a cost associated with support.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.400]   So, like Gus Mueller, I'm just looking at this post,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.480]   Gus Mueller had a few years ago about Mac Heist,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.680]   just talking about what it means for somebody
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.880]   who's trying to bootstrap a company.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.200]   But I also think about something like,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.600]   there's so many places like, you think about
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.480]   Buzz Anderson or the folks in Omni Group,
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.880]   and like, they're really dedicated
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.560]   to a certain level of support.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.400]   And if you're giving it away for, you know,
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.560]   two bucks a copy, and then you agree to support it
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.320]   for the rest of the, you know, life of that, I don't know.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.480]   I'm sorry, I don't mean to say I'm ganging up on these guys,
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.920]   but I just, you know, I see people who've worked really hard
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.520]   at this to like, be able to charge a premium
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.000]   for what they do, and then to feel like they've got
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.720]   to essentially just sort of give it away.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   - Well, and I have to admit that the,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.880]   that my reaction is also that I got a lot of those
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.600]   Stern talks when we released a Keir,
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.080]   a professional level green screen Keir for $200.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.800]   I had companies that sell their product for $600
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.360]   and $1,400 and $800, furious.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.960]   You know with us, you know that we were gonna sell--
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.000]   - Well, Chair, Chair, I have an account at Dreamhost,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.960]   like not the Slam Dreamhost, but have you ever gone
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.160]   to like a shared service where they go,
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.800]   they say, oh gosh, don't listen to all those other guys,
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.040]   you don't wanna go someplace where you got
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.640]   a metered bandwidth.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.240]   I can't believe you're gonna go to parrot.com
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   where you get only whatever two gigs a month.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.640]   We'll give you unlimited bandwidth.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.120]   Well, a lot of those places will give you unlimited bandwidth
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.720]   as long as you never use it.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.160]   And there is called overselling.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.320]   And if everybody in, had one of those quote unquote
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.640]   unlimited accounts, you used it at the same time,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.720]   everything would go down.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.160]   They don't have that much pipe.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.480]   - But people don't.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.840]   - But they don't, but they don't.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.800]   - But they don't, but if you buy it because you can,
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.160]   and then everybody does, I'm just saying it's, it's,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.480]   - If everyone who signed up for a gym actually went
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.400]   to the gym, it would shut down.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.840]   - Right, everybody does that.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   - It's like almost on your flight.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.240]   - Yeah, it's just what everybody does.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.200]   You have to do it, otherwise you're wasting.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:26.080]   I share your, kind of gut misgivings, Merlin,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.440]   but it's hard for me to find an intellectual reason for it.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.960]   And the other reason I don't buy it is 'cause I don't want
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.520]   to fill up my hard drive with a bunch of crap I don't want.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.600]   - A lot of it's good.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.440]   It really is, there's an article, I think I wanna say
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.920]   in the Atlantic or Harper's a few years ago about Walmart.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.360]   And it wasn't a hit job, but it was a really good article
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.280]   where they went out and talked to these companies
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.920]   that, and the ones that come to mind was plastic.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.920]   The article opens by talking about plastic pickles.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.720]   It didn't used to be, you wouldn't find pickles
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.960]   in the refrigerated area of the grocery store.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.840]   They were one of the first companies to put a giant amount
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.720]   of money into building this brand around paying
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.600]   a little more for pickles.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.560]   Now sure, you could say that that's a rip off,
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.240]   that they're charging more, or you could say that,
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.840]   oh, I'm gonna go buy cheaper pickles,
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   but it kind of sucks that in order for them to compete
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.400]   in the marketplace, they've got to go to Walmart.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.280]   And Walmart says, okay, here's what you're gonna do.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.320]   You're gonna make a five gallon thing of pickles.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.200]   It's gonna be $10 and you're gonna lower that price
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.240]   every year, or you're not gonna play here.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.080]   Levi's, you're gonna have to come out with a new
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.760]   kind of blue jeans to sell in here
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.360]   that you can't sell anywhere else.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.960]   - But this isn't quite that, because you don't have to sell
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.800]   on Mac Heist.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.720]   There's no leverage.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.200]   - You don't have to be a Walmart either.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.040]   - Yeah, but this is a tiny, this is a tiny segment.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.360]   This is like, it's not the same.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.720]   It's not anywhere near the same.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.080]   - Independent Mac software, this is tiny.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.520]   - I mean, it is, but the thing is,
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.640]   if I'm making something, if I'm an independent developer
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.840]   that's not developing something that directly competes
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.720]   with the seven things or eight things that are here,
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.240]   it doesn't really affect me at all,
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.600]   because when I'm paying $20 or $30 for a piece of software,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.000]   I'm handling a niche need that I have.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.400]   If it's not one of those things,
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.440]   I'm not gonna, it's not gonna matter.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.920]   - I was just picking back on what you said though,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.120]   and I guess I'm agreeing with your competitors.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.200]   If you're a company that's not charging $200
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.800]   for a green screen app,
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.240]   there might be a really good reason for that.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.520]   And maybe you just can't compete.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.960]   - Well, here's the deal, is the differences,
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.080]   is that they have a different business model than me.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.520]   Mine is we develop software because we use it,
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.280]   and then we pay off the engineering by selling it.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.160]   And so the thing is, is that I don't need,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.800]   I don't need to build the business the way they did,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.520]   so I have a much more efficient system to do it.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.800]   I have made, we support it, we're able to support it,
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.880]   we're able to do it at a much more efficient reason,
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.720]   and I don't feel like I have any,
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.520]   I don't owe them anything, I don't know these guys.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.320]   You know, I don't know these guys,
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.200]   I'm not gonna sit there and protect their market,
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.920]   because just because I'm much more efficient than they are.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.080]   - You know, and that's the thing, and the,
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   you know. - Yeah, but if a place moved
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.520]   in next door to you and started selling what you do
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.560]   at a tenth of the price,
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.440]   even though, 'cause they could get the work,
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.040]   even if it, I mean, there is something to be said,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.680]   and I'm not talking about like unionization even,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.320]   I'm just saying that, like in order for,
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.960]   and this is totally selfish, okay, I'm just gonna admit this,
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.840]   I have a lot of friends that are independent Mac developers,
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.120]   and I like to see them thrive.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.920]   A lot of them charge a lot for a product,
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.200]   because they put an extraordinary amount of work into it,
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.880]   and I think when people start giving this stuff away,
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.440]   and start basically cheapening the idea,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.720]   that the basically software is this thing
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.160]   that has no marginal cost, because it's just software.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.760]   Well, you know, if you support your product,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   and you really treat it like an adult,
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.280]   would, it costs a lot of money.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.040]   If you pay your employees health insurance,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.800]   that costs a lot of money.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.960]   And so-- - So you're right,
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.560]   there is a cost to discounting and low-balling.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.880]   - I don't know if it's the simplest thing,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.720]   I'm just gonna charge less,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.880]   'cause I don't need the money.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.840]   - Right, the developer of our primary product,
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.680]   just I just wanna put it in perspective,
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.560]   the developer of our primary green screen product
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.800]   makes more money, made more money last year than I did.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.400]   So I mean, I just wanna make sure that it's not,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.520]   we're not talking about low-balling anything.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.080]   You know, the thing, at the price that we're selling at.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:53.920]   And he's happy.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.280]   - Also-- - I think he's happy,
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.360]   I hope he's happy, 'cause--
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.560]   - Also, look at these apps that are being built,
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.640]   they're not really being done by even middle level software
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.120]   companies, they really do seem like
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.040]   your basic kitchen table software company,
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.480]   where there's two or three people associated
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.720]   with developing this app and supporting this app,
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.960]   and that these are people who are exploiting themselves,
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.360]   or they think else. - Right.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.400]   - And are, a lot of these-- - They should not be allowed
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.520]   to exploit themselves. - Exactly.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.880]   - And I have to admit that my model for everything,
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.640]   every business that I wanted to get into
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.080]   was me sweeping the floors to get into radio,
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.920]   that's how I got into-- - Right.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.360]   - And then I output them-- - Me and everybody there
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.800]   until they let me in.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.840]   I mean, I was told that I was being taken advantage of
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.040]   all the way to working on Star Wars and ILM.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.240]   You know, the thing is, is that it's not,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.320]   it is, you know, I did whatever I needed to do
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.160]   to move forward, and I looked at everyone else
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.400]   waiting for everything to be fair, as, you know,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.920]   people that I pass by on the way through.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.720]   And when I got to ILM, I found a whole bunch of people
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.720]   that were just like me.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.560]   (laughing)
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.160]   You know, so-- - That's how you get there.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.520]   - That's how you get there, you know, and it's,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.000]   and when we started our company,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.320]   our company has been very successful in this software,
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.640]   because I feel like I felt like I was--
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.320]   - The reason we wrote our own software is I got tired
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.720]   of paying for their software.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.360]   I was like, this is too much money for what it does.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.680]   - You know what's good news?
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.080]   And I have to commend Apple for this.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.520]   They dropped the price to become an Apple developer.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.840]   - Yeah. - 99 bucks.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.280]   - 99 bucks. - That's so cool.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.920]   - Apple Developer Connection Selector Premier Program
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   was $4.99 and $34.99 a year in the past.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.200]   Now you get it for, do you get the same thing
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.040]   you'd get for the Premier?
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.600]   No, probably not.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.440]   I don't know.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.480]   - Yeah, I have to imagine like in terms of like,
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.680]   getting into like WWDC and stuff like that,
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.280]   I imagine that's gotta be, do you know much about that?
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.920]   Well, actually, do you go to WWDC and Alex?
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.240]   - I have spoken there. - I have spoken there once
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.320]   and I've gone a couple times.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.080]   It is one of the best, it is incredible.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.920]   Incredible.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.120]   I mean, and it'll sell out this year.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.920]   It'll, because of the iPad, it will sell out
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.320]   like two days after it opens.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.480]   - I think it's to go to conference.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.040]   I've never had to pay to go, but I mean,
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.600]   I understand for the folks who are gonna be there.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.440]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.120]   It's pretty costly.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.240]   - Yeah, I mean, historically,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.880]   there's always been that firewall between,
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.560]   well, not just the expense of going,
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.120]   but also the fact that you have to be member of a club
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.200]   in order to get in.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.840]   And there's at some point someone who says
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.760]   that you can come and you cannot come.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.720]   So that's always, I think the end effect of that
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.080]   has always been that you don't get,
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.520]   I'll use the word riff-raff because it's two syllables
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.360]   instead of like the four sentences it would take
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.160]   to explain the idea of people who are there
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.080]   because they're interested as opposed to their,
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.480]   people who are there to learn or there
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.160]   who have information to share.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.840]   So I don't think I've ever spoken to anybody
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.160]   who's attended WWDC with a goal in mind
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.840]   who did not find those goals, man.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.760]   - It's $1,200 to get a WWDC ticket,
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.520]   but you don't get that anymore.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.520]   That's not part of the deal.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:42.080]   And you also, you don't get the hardware discounts,
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.920]   which were significant.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.520]   You only get 10 support incidents,
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.720]   but 10's enough for a lot of people.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.400]   - What I wanted to check is do you also get seeds of betas?
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.240]   You do. - I'm upcoming
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   at West really- - It looks like you do.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.600]   You get- - I think, I think,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.000]   this is a lot like the earlier days in the developer program.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.640]   I joined the developer program initially
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.920]   because I just wanted to get access to betasies.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.000]   I wanted to get access to information
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.880]   you couldn't get access to elsewhere.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.600]   That was like, it's sort of like AppleCare++.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   And I think a lot of people are gonna see that 99 bucks
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.200]   as interesting people who are operating at a certain level
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.600]   are gonna buy that extra $99 package
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.120]   just to get access to the new proceeds.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.040]   - Yeah, I did it for leper.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:20.880]   - Sure.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.760]   You get pre-releases, technical documentation, Xcode 3.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.080]   You get that for free.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.680]   Development videos, member only developer forums
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.160]   and two technical code level support incidents.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.640]   An additional incidents purchased in muddles
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.920]   of two for 99 bucks.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.560]   - And it's $99 a year, right?
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.400]   - Yeah.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.760]   And remember the iPhone developer program was 99 bucks as well.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.640]   So essentially they eliminated all these fancy programs.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.200]   If you're gonna go ad hoc, if you wanna buy more support,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.360]   you're gonna go ad hoc if you wanna buy hardware.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.560]   You'll pay for your ticket to WWDC.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.400]   I think this is great.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.480]   I think this is what Apple should do.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.880]   This is how you get developers involved.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.720]   Did you make it that you lower the level
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.400]   to get-- - I think they could get,
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.320]   I mean, I think that if Apple wanted to,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.640]   they could make WWDC nearly the size of Macworld.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.480]   And there's so many people who wanna go up.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.560]   - Yeah, I wonder why they don't, you know?
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.040]   I'd just be something else they have to manage.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.480]   They don't really, you know, that's not.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.400]   Maybe they should, who knows?
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.880]   Maybe we should do a conference before it.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.960]   - I have to say for 99 bucks, I think I will join.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.000]   I mean, why not?
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.840]   - I bet.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.360]   - We should do Twitworld both the week before that show.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.280]   - Twitworld.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.200]   What we were talking about.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.880]   You know what, Alex and I are really excited about doing this.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.840]   You know what, big nerd ranches?
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.000]   Oh yeah, I went to college with Aaron.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.600]   - Aaron Hilagas wrote-- - He's the best.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.680]   - The bestest book on cocoa development,
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.120]   which I have in a love. - I'm dying.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.080]   - And he created Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.920]   which is kind of, it's in Atlanta area.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.600]   - It's out of Atlanta, yeah.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.440]   - Do you stay there?
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.840]   - I think you stay there.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.480]   You stay there, you know, you're in a cocoon of coding.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.800]   - We met the Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.640]   - Cacoon of coding.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.680]   - We met the guys at Macworld, and when I met him,
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.520]   I said, you know, I've always wanted to do a Twit
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.560]   like week at, because they do week.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.440]   You go there for a week to study development.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.560]   So I always wanted to do a Twit week at Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.360]   And so I think we're gonna do that in,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.440]   we don't know yet, maybe June, July.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.440]   We have to figure it out.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.360]   Yeah. - But I figured it out.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.320]   - And we'll have a few to give away.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.240]   Alex and I'll go.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.320]   If you guys wanna go, please,
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.720]   we'd love to have you guys go.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.560]   - When is this, when do you wanna do that?
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.680]   - Well, we don't know the date yet.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.520]   We're talking about it.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.640]   - We don't have the dates yet, but we're talking about,
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.280]   it's like, they have a course,
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.120]   it's a great course on iPhone development,
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.720]   and it really starts you, you cover Objective C
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   for a couple days, and then you dive into
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.560]   developing-- - Yeah, you have to know
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.400]   Objective C first, right?
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.280]   - We have to know some programming first.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.560]   And then scripting programming, some C,
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.360]   but then you go in and they'll cover Objective C
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.360]   for two days, and then iPhone development for five days.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.040]   And I know that I just wanna have,
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.560]   I just wanna know enough to fiddle,
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.280]   'cause we have people that we work with
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.720]   to actually do the coding, heavy coding,
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.320]   but I wanna be able to fiddle with building
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.680]   my own little iPhone apps that are silly.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.280]   - Me too, that's what I want.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.720]   - Yeah, and so I think this is gonna,
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.560]   I almost went, when we started talking about,
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.400]   I got so excited they had won next week,
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.800]   it's so loud. - You almost just went.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.640]   I almost just paid for it,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.400]   and I was just like, I'm just gonna go down there right now,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.240]   and just-- - I think it would be
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.560]   so much fun. - Yeah, I'm very excited about that.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.400]   - So I think we're pretty sure we're gonna do this,
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.960]   they've agreed to do it, so we just have to figure out
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.240]   a date that-- - Just our dates,
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   'cause we kinda have to shut down--
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.320]   - So I mean, everybody on the team,
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.000]   I always felt like the best teams that I've been on,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.120]   certainly there's a certain degree of specialization,
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.040]   but also the really best teams were the ones
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.280]   where there was a little bit of overlap
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.880]   between the different jobs people had,
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.320]   where you kinda could, you understood enough
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.840]   about what other people did,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.400]   that you could speak intelligently and have some empathy
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.120]   for what their problems were,
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.360]   what they're different from yours,
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.520]   and getting your hands dirty with that stuff
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.520]   would really help you understand,
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.640]   I cracked up gonna open Xcode the other day
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.680]   just to kinda go look at what would be involved
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.040]   in making an iPhone out,
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.920]   and it's gorgeous, (laughs)
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.320]   I have no idea where to, I don't know if it's a view-based--
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.480]   - I think we could do it. - I think we could do it.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.520]   I think yeah, there's a hump,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.560]   and if we got over the hump, then we could all--
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.960]   - Then we could do it. - It's terrible podcast
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.520]   on programming. - I think it's smaller.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.360]   - I think it's smaller. - Yeah.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.200]   - It's all nice, all nice, all nice.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.040]   - I think it'd be valuable if there were,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.920]   if anybody were ever to do a developer camp
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.600]   that was more like iPhone developer fantasy camp,
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.600]   or iPad developer fantasy camp,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.000]   for guys like us who are not thinking
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.560]   that we're gonna be building the next Photoshop
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.280]   for the iPad or for the desktop,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   but we just wanna understand all the technologies
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.120]   that make this sort of work,
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   and if we were to ever work with programmers,
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.040]   and they would say, "Well, we've got the NS class view,
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.640]   "but unfortunately we can't do a web kit view
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.720]   "inside the text view unless we render the site
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.360]   "as PDF beforehand, which means we're gonna need
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.560]   "to have four different versions of this PDF
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.120]   "just to make sure that the scaling works,
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.840]   "and we'll be able to not and actually understand
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.680]   "what's going on.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.520]   "We won't be able to write the code,
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.760]   "but we'll be able to maybe understand the frameworks
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.600]   "and how they operate."
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.680]   I think that'd be something I would definitely sign up for.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.280]   - By the way, they had a new web sign up
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.560]   if you haven't been there recently,
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.000]   and it's beautiful. - Unbelievable.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.160]   - And they're building a new, say,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.960]   a monastic learning center that encompasses
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.800]   Aaron's vision for where it takes a little time.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   - I wanna do this title, I'm afraid.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   - I was in a band with Aaron, Aaron Play, Saks.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.840]   We were in a really crappy scott band together.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.240]   I think it was called Dog School,
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.280]   and I play guitar and he played Saks.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.840]   He's the real deal, he's such a great guy.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.040]   - The thing that won me over is--
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:56.960]   - Very tall, very tall.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.800]   - Is he?
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.360]   In the forward, I guess this must be him right in the hat.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.760]   Here, the cowboy hat, is that him?
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.000]   - Yep.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   - He looks tall.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.160]   He also looks like he's got a small head
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.520]   or a big hat, one or the other.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.200]   The thing that won me over is he says in the forward,
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.440]   he says, "Coffee is not a substitute for a good night's sleep."
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.040]   (laughing)
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.560]   He says, "You must get a good night's sleep
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.320]   "if you come to Big Nerd Ranch."
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.640]   (laughing)
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.320]   I am seeing it as Nerd Fantasy Camp.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.360]   I am not seeing it as like I'm gonna become a pro.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.000]   I'm seeing it as Fantasy Camp.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.840]   - Totally.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.680]   - Totally.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.760]   - So that's what we're gonna do,
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.000]   and we'll tell you the details.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.320]   - Would it be just the Twitch folks?
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.800]   Only thing I'm thinking, and not some kind,
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   but if there's folks there who do know it,
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.160]   would it be dragging down the more experienced folks?
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.240]   If there were a bunch of noobs there?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.360]   - That's up to the Nerd Ranch folks,
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.040]   but I think that we would try to take over
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.520]   the ranch for a week, basically.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.640]   - Smart, ah, that'd be awesome.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.400]   - Yeah, I think that's the plan.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.720]   - It'll be like Regis and Cathy Lee
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.560]   when they go to--
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.400]   - Disneyland.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.240]   - They go to Bush Gardens.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.080]   - Yeah, yeah, Bush Gardens.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.200]   - What the dungeon dice?
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.520]   - Yeah.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.040]   Yeah, we could play "Wear Wolf at Night."
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.840]   It'll be fun, it'll be really fun.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.680]   I can't wait.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.720]   - Can we try this fair, talk about boys.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.360]   - Yeah, that'd be great, I can't wait.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.400]   Yeah, I'll give you my--
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   - It's still the mainstream.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.520]   - My I am handle, if you give me yours.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.960]   So anyway, that's just something we're playing with,
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.560]   but obviously now we're gonna get a lot of email,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.400]   we better do it.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.760]   - Yeah, now it's where we're committed.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.600]   - Yeah.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   - We're committed. - Never share a good idea
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.680]   before you realize how much work is gonna be involved.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.960]   You're talking to a person who twice has suggested,
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.320]   you know it would be a great idea,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.600]   a great seminar for me to do,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.160]   three hours on networking,
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.320]   on a cruise ship with no network of its own.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.160]   - Yeah.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.000]   - Yeah.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.440]   - Great idea, but four months in advance,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.280]   when you're packing up,
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.120]   I didn't tell you-- - Seems like a good idea.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.000]   - If you need to develop it, yeah.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.680]   - Yeah.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.200]   - Oh, well.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.920]   - So folks, we're gonna take a break
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.360]   and get our picks of the week.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.280]   Here in just a little bit,
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.680]   there's a lot more to talk about,
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.200]   but as usual, right up against the wall
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.360]   and we ended up rat-holing our way out of existence here.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.760]   So let's just take a little break
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.080]   and get our audible pick of the week,
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.720]   and then we'll get to your software
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.560]   or hardware picks of the week with our panelists,
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.000]   Mr. Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.400]   Mr. Merlin Mann from 43folders.com,
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.480]   and of course, Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.640]   First though, let me tell you about audible.com.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.400]   It's a great place to get books, audio books,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.600]   audio entertainment of all kinds.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.520]   They've also got comedy performances,
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.720]   radio shows, classic radio.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   Audible.com, take a look.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.520]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.000]   you can sign up for the gold account.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.800]   That'll give you a book a month.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.840]   And the first one's free,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.360]   yours to keep you can cancel at any time,
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.560]   but I'm telling you,
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.200]   audible has just changed my life.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.760]   I started listening to audiobooks many years ago
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.360]   when I had a long commute to tech TV.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.560]   I was getting cassettes.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.440]   And then I discovered Audible about 2001
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.880]   and 400 books later.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.760]   I am just the biggest audible nerd.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.720]   I listened to at least a couple of books a month
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.800]   and I love it.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   Take a look at audible.com/macbreak,
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.160]   sign up for your first book.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.400]   There's some good stuff on the front of here.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.240]   What are you listening to these days, Andy?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.080]   You got anything for us?
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.680]   I was thinking this, the Hugo,
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.040]   the rise and fall of the worst car in history.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.400]   That might be good.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.640]   (laughing)
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.680]   - Well, you know, the Hugo did give the Travanta
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.240]   run for the time there.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.480]   It's good to see competition
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.640]   in the former Soviet Republic marketplace.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.480]   (laughing)
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.320]   Yes.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.400]   As they learned capitalism from the bottom up.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.880]   Actually, the book that I literally bought
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.120]   just about a half an hour ago
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.080]   was something I've been sort of eyeing for a little while.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.360]   Audible lets you maintain a wish list
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.720]   so that there are things you're eyeballing it
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.720]   and then you'll put in the wish list.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.960]   And then my process,
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.000]   'cause I get that one credit a month off my gold plan.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.760]   And then the next thing is I'll read some reviews
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.320]   and then usually I'll download like the free preview
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.760]   you can get like on Kindle, even on through Kindle app.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.920]   And I just find myself,
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.240]   when I find myself rereading the intro to this book three times,
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.800]   I realize that, okay, I'm gonna need to buy the audiobook.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.600]   It's called "The Big Burn, Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.800]   That Saved America" by Timothy Egan.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   - Oh, how interesting.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.760]   I was like, "Somethin' that I wanna get that."
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.720]   - It was about this wildfire in the early 1900s
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.440]   that grew to the size of the state of Connecticut.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.000]   And eventually it would destroy enough,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.560]   the same amount of land
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.480]   as is currently in Yellowstone National Park.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.640]   And just to, if you have an iPhone
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.960]   and you have the Kindle app,
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.560]   I guarantee just download the intro to this
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.480]   in which he opens up by explaining
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.320]   what it was like in the small town.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.960]   They know that this fire is coming.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.120]   They don't know whether they need to evacuate this town
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.560]   that they've already rebuilt once after wildfires 20 years ago.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.000]   They're hoping that they don't lose their town
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.840]   a second time, but they know here are the plans,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.160]   what happens if it turns out
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.880]   that the fire is still advancing.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:43.040]   And the description is so vivid of what that day was like
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.440]   that you could almost be certain that no,
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.240]   this is 1941 and the army is advancing
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.960]   on this small, small village
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.400]   because that's what the fire was like.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.360]   It was the great enemy.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.520]   It was being fought by military people.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.160]   It was fought by civilians using every implement
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.000]   they could have at hand.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.360]   The women and children were being put onto trains,
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.720]   told that no, you cannot take your pet parrot with you.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.000]   You have to just leave everything and just count it.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.240]   Being destroyed, you'll be lucky to leave with your lives.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.880]   And that's really the only recommendation
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.240]   that counts for any book.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.720]   It is so well written.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.920]   But the larger story is the context he puts it in
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   about Teddy Roosevelt who, as he's starting his presidency
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.040]   as really big on conservation,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.320]   is really, it's killing him that all these land barons
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.680]   are stripping natural resources of America,
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.040]   bear for minerals and all this other resources.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.840]   And he really has it on the back of his mind
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.040]   that I really wanna make sure
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.000]   that we can start protecting this land.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.120]   So he started the Forest Service with the one
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.360]   of his trusted guys and all the different
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.880]   congressmen who were worried about,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.960]   who were essentially in the timber
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.920]   and the metal industries, pockets are like underfunding
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.200]   and trying to undermine it wherever, however it happens.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.000]   And then there's this incredible wildfire
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.240]   that is not just destroying natural forests,
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.880]   but it's destroying every town that's been built.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.280]   That we're trying to claw our way west
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.640]   to actually expand the country,
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.560]   drive the rail spurs west,
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.480]   take advantage of the resources of this land,
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.360]   hopefully in a manageable way, but either way.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.640]   And suddenly it becomes such a popular cause
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.120]   aided and abetted by journalists who bring home
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.320]   all these reports of the desperate situations
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.480]   of these towns that unfortunately the congressmen
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.520]   realized that they cannot stay at the pork trough
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.080]   if people will vote them out of the office
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   and being voted back in office means
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.760]   making sure this would never happen again.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.720]   So it almost feels as though it may be a cheap way
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.880]   in my mind that it's kind of similar to the Iraq war
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.960]   in many ways because if not for this big huge disaster,
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.040]   this plan that was in the back of these guys' minds
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.680]   who probably would not have been able to get funding
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.280]   for this thing they wanted to do,
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.360]   suddenly had their reason to leap this forward
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.600]   because finally this was something that could get
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.920]   everybody's mind on this one problem
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.720]   and how we can actually address it.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.600]   And it steered the focus of the world's attention,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.280]   excuse me, of the country's attention
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:01.080]   towards the importance of maintaining the forests,
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.960]   making sure that if whether you're on one side or the other,
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.840]   when you're on conservation aside or geez,
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.960]   we need all these minerals and all these resources,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.200]   either way you want the wildfires to stop
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.360]   because you cannot get resources out of a land
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.800]   that's if all the rail spurs,
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.360]   of all the roads and all the people who are there
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.800]   to help haul that ore out of the land are just burned to death.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.120]   So, but what a compelling, compelling opening couple
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.520]   of chapters, like I said, I've read it twice.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.760]   I've read those things twice already
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   and that at that point it started to feel like a bum
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.200]   who's just sort of saying, okay, look,
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.080]   - He worked awfully hard on that.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.760]   I think you should give him some money.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.880]   - Either the freakin' bogg.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.080]   - Roosevelt was the one who started the National Parks, right?
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.560]   I mean, so this is how the National Parks got their start,
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.400]   really.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.320]   - Yeah, and that's really, if there's any way that really,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.880]   the book makes the statement that if there's a reason
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.440]   why we have a National Park system,
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.480]   if there's a reason why all this forestry land
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.640]   is absolutely owned by the people,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.360]   available to the people, cannot be exploited by other people.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.160]   And no, that's not negotiable.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.760]   It was this fire that gave the people who were on this side,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.080]   the political power to say, nope, we own this,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.480]   we're taking this land, we cannot develop it,
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.200]   we cannot put more people on it,
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.680]   we're gonna staff with lots and lots of new rangers
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.320]   and lots and lots and lots of new resources
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.480]   so that anybody who wants to enjoy that land for private
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.360]   use can do it for their own, in a public way can do that.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.720]   But nope, it's locked down,
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.640]   you ain't get into Yellowstone, that's it.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.400]   - Yeah, boy, that would have been horrible, wouldn't it?
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.120]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, just tear it.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.680]   - I mean, it was, again, the descriptions
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.080]   of what was going on from the people
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.160]   who were fighting this fire,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.840]   and they're taking prisoners out of prison cells
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.240]   and putting a shovel in their hands
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.360]   and saying that you can either fight this fire
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.760]   and die on your feet as a hero,
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.320]   or you can run and we'll shoot you in the head
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.640]   and you'll be burned anyway.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.000]   (laughing)
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:45.840]   - They've never done that.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.880]   - Yeah, exactly, that was exactly it.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.640]   They were told that, you know what?
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.080]   You have a slim chance of survival
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   that is in helping us fight this fire.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.680]   If you try to run, you know what?
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.360]   We'll just, there ain't gonna be a body left autopsy, son.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.200]   We'll just pretend that you just got caught up
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.040]   in the flames.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.360]   - Sounds like a Quentin Tarantino movie
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.680]   in the making there, I think.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.520]   - Yeah.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.360]   - It's the main option this way.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.600]   - Various firefighters.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.800]   - Yeah, I'm glorious, firefighters.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.920]   The Big Burn, Teddy Roosevelt and the Roosevelt
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.120]   and the fire that saved America, Timothy Egan, the author.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.800]   Yes, this could be yours, absolutely free,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.720]   as with many of our Audible books,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.440]   all you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.720]   and get a credit towards your first book
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.760]   and it's yours to keep even if you decide
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   to cancel at any time.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.440]   Really a great, I love Audible, a great service.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.400]   I'm listening to three different Audible books right now.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.480]   It's so funny.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.720]   The Time Traveler's Wife, which I love is very romantic.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.840]   I didn't see the movie, but I love the book.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.280]   Demon by Daniel Suarez, which is incredible,
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.640]   incredible story.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.600]   And The Black Hole Wars by Suskind,
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.640]   which is about physics in black holes.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.800]   See a little non-fiction, a little fiction?
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.720]   A couple of little fiction sci-fi, I just love that.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.200]   I've been dabbling with the super-frickinomics.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.000]   That's a good book, except there's some issues on the climate.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.960]   Is that the one where you shoot the hose into the sky
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.360]   to make global warming go on?
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.680]   Yeah, yeah, that's exactly.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.280]   There's a little bit of a problem with that chapter,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.680]   but other than that, and the kids
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.200]   stays in the picture I took from Andy's--
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.160]   What a great book.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.600]   That is Robert Evans.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.840]   Oh my gosh, it is so good.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.320]   Oh, I'm so good.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.400]   See, this turns you back on to books.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.960]   In the same way that Napster got me back into music.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.880]   Right.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.400]   Absolutely.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.560]   I've been trying to find a way to write about this
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.320]   so that when people yell at me that I'm an idiot,
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.520]   that at least they'll make points that are absolutely fair,
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.160]   as opposed to points that are just unbalanced.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.960]   Because I honestly-- I'm almost at the point
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.640]   where if independent bookstores die,
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.400]   I'm kind of OK with that.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.080]   Because so much of the content now is digital.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.920]   I'm reading way more books, both through electronic means
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.200]   and also through listening to them
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.680]   by audible than I ever read when I always
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.480]   had to be carrying around hard covers wherever I went.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.120]   And I also had a bad experience with a really great bookstore
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.200]   in San Francisco that announced to me
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.840]   that they do not carry PG Woodhouse because the buyer does not
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.600]   like him.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.280]   At which point, I just turned-- I wasn't angry, but I'm like,
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.840]   but that means that I can't trust any of your decisions
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.600]   and any kind.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.640]   And you're the city-like bookstore.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.040]   You want to like the five famous books or--
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:09.560]   Exactly.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.640]   That's shocking.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.240]   No, we don't carry wood.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:12.760]   And I think--
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.600]   Would you like to throw in Giddy?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.240]   Well, the folks who work there were actually apologetic.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.720]   They're like, no, Paul doesn't like him.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.120]   I'm like, wait, Paul doesn't like who?
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:20.640]   Woodhouse.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.880]   I'm like, Paul is the name of your spaniel dog?
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.960]   A little bit of a mask.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.400]   No, he's a human being with eyes and ears and a brain.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   Oh, OK.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.240]   It's really weird.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.000]   City lights is like one of those places where you go,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.240]   and the hamburgers are good as long as you like it exactly
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.440]   like the other makes it.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.280]   If you don't want an egg on it, you should go somewhere else.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.120]   And that's fine.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.200]   It's just to realize that as a consumer myself,
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.240]   that means that if the city lights bookstore were
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.960]   close at shop, there'd be tens of thousands,
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.440]   hundreds of thousands of words written about what a damn shame
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.800]   it is and how this illustrates the problems
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.920]   of independent bookstores.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.640]   But I'd be like, oh, well, that was a bad store.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.320]   Anyway, who cares?
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.000]   I would never split foot back in there.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   By the way, there's a great bio of Teddy Roosevelt
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.280]   on Audible called Theodore Rex, which I read some time ago.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.200]   Really great story.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.520]   He was a character.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.280]   Yeah, character.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:06.800]   He got shy.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.360]   And then he gave a speech.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.160]   I mean, he had a bullet in him.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.560]   And then he gave a speech.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.080]   And that's what I call--
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:15.680]   He's also a situation.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.280]   He's also a situation.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.200]   You don't make guys like that anymore.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.520]   We're so used to understanding all of these false dichotomies.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.440]   In the last 30, 40 years, it seems like,
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.760]   there's so many--
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.600]   you've got to be this way or you've got to be that way.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.240]   And in retrospect, he seems like such a--
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.480]   he was a complex character.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.200]   But there's so many things.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.080]   He loved to hunt, but he was also like--
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:33.600]   Conservationists.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.160]   He's got to be one of the greatest conservationists.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.160]   And my dad was in Ducks Unlimited.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.120]   Yeah, they're conservationists because they
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.440]   want to save the ducks.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.760]   We're going to save them so we can kill them.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.960]   No, Ducks Unlimited is great.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.360]   They do a lot of great work preserving
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.120]   the duck environments in this state.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.280]   I think that we wouldn't have a lot of the environmental stuff
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.440]   we have at the work of the duck.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.600]   I should do something like that with Steer and Lobster.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.800]   Lobster Unlimited.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.640]   I just want to make sure they're always there.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.280]   I just want to be fun-limited.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.080]   All right, let's--
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.720]   There's a reason why the Lobstermen have to measure
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.160]   the baby lobsters and throw them back in with their cod.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.360]   It's not because they don't want to kill baby lobsters.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.720]   It's because the baby lobsters aren't as tasty.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.120]   Man, that's right.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.520]   I'll see you again soon enough.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.160]   Put on some bean mats.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.560]   Put on special exercises we just got.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.640]   A couple more LPs, and you'll do nicely.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.760]   They're just big bugs.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.000]   All right, let's say it's time now ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.560]   Big tasty bugs.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.760]   We love them.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.200]   Hello, buggy.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.720]   It is time for our pick of the week.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.960]   Let us start with you, Mr. Alex Lindsey,
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.080]   since you're sitting right here.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:41.760]   I have two picks.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.400]   Two picks?
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.760]   One hardware, one iPhone.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.240]   All right.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.160]   So the first one-- and I'm only recommending this.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.920]   I've had this for a long time, but I'm recommending it
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.760]   because three times in the last week,
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.000]   so I put a smart card into my computer, my older laptop.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.560]   And someone said, how did you do that?
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.120]   And this is what you need.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.600]   I have one of those, and I love it.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.720]   You've been express card.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.320]   This is Sandisk makes it.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.360]   That's the one I have.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.480]   It's the express card adapter for SDHHC, multi-media card,
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.080]   MMC+, memory stick, memory stick, memory stick.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.520]   You don't really need that anymore.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.360]   And the newer ones.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:15.800]   The newer ones.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.400]   But if you have an older one with an express card
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.800]   and you're trying to figure out how to have something portable
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.280]   that you can just absolutely pop--
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.920]   I just keep it in my computer all the time.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.480]   And I have to admit, I really like this solution better
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.320]   than the one that Apple came up with, which is only
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.280]   have an SD card reader.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.440]   I love having my express card.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.640]   Yeah, get the flexibility if you need it.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.200]   We have gears and all kinds of other stuff
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.240]   into my laptop through my express card.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.960]   And it's actually why I'm hanging onto this laptop,
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.240]   specifically so I can have my express slot.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.320]   But most of the time, 90% of the time,
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.360]   all I need is an SD card.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.520]   And so that is--
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   That's my hardware.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.360]   Well, they have one for compact flash, too.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.720]   They have one for compact flash.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.560]   It sticks out a little bit.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.600]   Yeah, it sticks out a little bit, which
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.040]   is a little bit of a bummer.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.720]   I have the-- when I bought my 15-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.840]   the first unibody, which didn't have the reader,
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.280]   that's when I bought it, I bought the reader.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.440]   Because it's so convenient to pop that right in there.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.480]   I just use it all the time.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.880]   And as I said, people were like, what is that?
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.440]   How are you doing that on an older computer?
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.680]   And that's how I do it.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.800]   The second one is just a fun--
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.160]   It was about 30 bucks, as I remember.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.440]   Yeah, like 25, 30 bucks.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   It's not the major.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.560]   The second one is music.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.200]   So I'm trying not to play as many games.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.200]   And I got this thing called digital baseline.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.080]   Have you guys seen this?
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.000]   Let's see if I can-- I don't know if it's going to have the one.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.080]   I just-- yeah, it might have-- here we go.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.960]   So here-- so silly.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.800]   So you can have your own theme song, basically.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.160]   As you walk through the streets in the city--
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.680]   I'm walking on a city.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.680]   So this is a sequencer.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.400]   This is a DB303 sequencer.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.000]   And I can play with the distortion.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.440]   And I can do all the-- this isn't a very good one.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.520]   I was just playing.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.760]   But the point is, is you have all the basic sequencer stuff
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.720]   that you would normally have on one of those things.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.440]   And you can put it together.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.480]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.840]   And it's really-- it still has the ammo.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.760]   Can you do anything with it or just play it?
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.840]   Well, no, you can build stuff.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.960]   So you can-- so I can go.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.800]   And then-- well, I'm glad you can do that.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.640]   Well, I'm working it.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.280]   I'm adding-- it takes a little while to take notes.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:20.960]   Oh, I'm just teasing you.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   Come on.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.800]   It's just giving you a high salary.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.440]   And carrots are just the base of a soup by pure profit.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.000]   Not going to just be salary-incare.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.600]   It's not going to be a boring soup.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.840]   $4.99, it is really cool looking.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.680]   Because you've got to--
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.040]   You've got to--
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.680]   Seems to have slowly--
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.080]   So you can slowly--
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   So you get a key board, too?
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.160]   And then you can add them together.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.000]   And then I can go back to play.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.520]   Sorry.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.840]   It doesn't-- it-- no, it just has this little--
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.440]   it has this little dash where you're adding things.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.160]   So you basically have a 16-beat measure that you are slowly
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.920]   adding what is it going to do for each note.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.920]   So you keep on building up these different layers.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.360]   And so--
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.520]   Sure, that's good stuff.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.080]   Mighty good stuff.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.240]   Anyway.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.560]   I like it.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.000]   So anyway, digital base--
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.960]   Base line for $4.99.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.720]   I got into this thing where I downloaded a whole bunch of them.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.520]   See, this is--
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   But you can download--
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520]   Is my base lines for it?
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.440]   No, I downloaded a whole bunch of sequencers and so on and so forth.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.280]   And I feel like this is part of my job for this
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.840]   is to go buy a bunch of these and play them all.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.120]   And that was the best one.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.920]   So I thank you.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.360]   So that's what I'm trying to do more of,
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.880]   is get a bunch of them, play with them,
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.520]   and not go into each one of them.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.200]   But of all the ones that I played with,
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.680]   that is the best one I could find.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.400]   Very cool.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.600]   Muylin man, you're pick of the week, Si.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.080]   He's gone.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:36.580]   I'm here.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   He went to get his pick.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.280]   He's got his ability up.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.240]   The invisibility cloak is amazing.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:42.920]   Let me be honest.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.440]   Let me be honest.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.560]   I just ordered a pizza.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.160]   It made me--
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.320]   The guy came.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.640]   I had a call to confirm my order.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.600]   And that's what happened.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.880]   Oh, hey, that's the most important thing.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.160]   In fact, we'll be right there.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.440]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.680]   What did you get on the pizza?
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.240]   Seriously?
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.320]   I think I got-- it's a little meaty.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.000]   Is that OK?
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.120]   No, I love meat.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.120]   I got sausage, mushroom, linguy--
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.760]   you know, the Portuguese sausage.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.440]   How do you grease it?
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:07.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.760]   And extra cheese.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.040]   And then I got some hot wings.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.480]   And what I do is I'll eat the wings.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.360]   I'm like an old person.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.880]   And then I have a little of the pizza,
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.000]   and then I save it in the refrigerator.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.640]   I can have more.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.840]   So, my mozzarella to Buffalo in West Portal.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.440]   Look it up.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.320]   Ooh, it sounds awful good.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.240]   It is awful good.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.040]   And you know, the thing is these shows go on.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.440]   And I figure I've got to take care of myself.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.640]   Otherwise, I can't help you guys.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.120]   Right.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:29.320]   Right.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:29.760]   You know what I mean?
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.120]   No.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   I like to get my help off.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.280]   I'm not going to be doing your own mask before you try to assist
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:33.840]   others.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.360]   Exactly.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.200]   Exactly, Andy, precisely.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.960]   I have-- gosh, I don't know how to--
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.360]   I guess kind of one and a half or two and a half
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.400]   picks that are very related.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.440]   I discovered something as I've been writing more
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.200]   as a thing that I do, that I tend to work in different modes
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.600]   that all sort of work in conjunction.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.480]   In other words, when you're thinking about writing
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.000]   and you haven't done a lot of writing,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.160]   you think you sit down and type.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.560]   And you can do that.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.880]   And some people can pull that off.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.640]   But the truth is-- and obviously, that's
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.320]   the important part is as Andy says, moving the cursor
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:07.960]   to the right.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.440]   But another big part of it is I think in terms of outlines.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.280]   Sometimes I'll just kind of work freehand.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.040]   It sounds really crazy until you actually do it.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.320]   But I sometimes need to get out of a certain way of thinking.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.360]   And that really actually really kind of stokes my productivity.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.760]   And for myself, things like mind maps and outlines
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.520]   are really, really helpful.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.920]   Now, if I'm doing a mind map on the Mac, gosh,
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.520]   there's at least half a dozen fantastic apps for doing that.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.400]   If I'm doing outlining on the Mac,
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.080]   I've got a text mate and on the outliner.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.120]   But on my iPhone, I've got--
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.520]   I perceive that I have fewer options.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.080]   That is a very long-winded way of saying there
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.840]   are two apps that I have found in this last week
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.080]   for doing outlining and mind maps.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.160]   And I've looked at a lot of both kinds of apps.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.600]   And I've finally found two that I really like.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.960]   Do you have a preference on where I start?
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.560]   How about I start with the mind mapping?
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.360]   OK.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.880]   For those of you who aren't familiar,
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.040]   I think the term was coined by this guy, Tony Boozan.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.200]   And it's basically that notion of you start by writing--
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.880]   usually with markers is the best way to do this.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.160]   You write something in the middle of the page
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.120]   and then just create branches.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.080]   And once you kind of let yourself
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.560]   kind of disappear into this process,
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.280]   it's a tremendous way to find connections between things
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.080]   and to sort of figure out what you know about something.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.240]   Most of you have probably tried it.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.120]   And I have to say doing it with markers on paper
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.840]   is far and away, like by orders of magnitude the best way.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.720]   But it's actually also really fun to do on the phone.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.560]   And there's a couple pretty good apps for this.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.480]   I have tried-- we'll find this one.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.760]   I have so many applications.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.800]   This is so embarrassing.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.720]   This would be good on the iPad, because I think a little bit
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.520]   bigger screen would be nice for a--
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.360]   I mean, my mapping tends to use a screen space pretty well.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.760]   Well, that's what's neat about this.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.920]   I wish I could show it to you.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.280]   For my mind mapping omni-graffle.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.120]   That's kind of my--
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.760]   I've been using Nova Mind on the desktop.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.560]   What is Nova Mind?
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.120]   The rest of the--
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.400]   Free Mind is-- Nova Mind and Mind Manager
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400]   are both really good but cost.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.920]   Free Mind is open source.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:00.040]   And actually, if you can stand the kind of Java swing-looking
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:00.560]   interface--
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.400]   I see I don't want that.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.640]   Very powerful.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.080]   Well, then let me tell you about an app for the Mac.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.440]   Oh, just as it also ran, Headspace for the iPhone.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.240]   If you like what a kind of interesting interface, Headspace
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.320]   lets you basically move--
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.800]   you can drag things into other things and move them around.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.440]   And the distinguishing thing about Headspace
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.400]   is it's kind of 3D looking, because it's pretty neat.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.480]   But in the end, I went with-- for the mind mapping part,
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.560]   I've ended up really liking this app called--
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.040]   it has the name of--
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.240]   it is an app.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.520]   It gets in the scrolling.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.720]   These are so important.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.680]   All these are so important.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.520]   I know in my computer, omni-graffle--
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.880]   I think I spend more time in that than I spend.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.240]   I use omni-graffle instead of Illustrator now.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.680]   I've got to get good with omni-graffle,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.960]   because I pay for the pro and everything.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.880]   And I just--
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.840]   I just think in it.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.480]   I just think in it.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.720]   I'm like, oh, and then I'll connect this,
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.480]   and then I'll do this.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.080]   I need a little in-service.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:56.400]   Go ahead.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.920]   Let me get you a quickie on omni-graffle.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.040]   And again, I work with those.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.120]   So disclosure, I do some--
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.360]   they're pals, and I work with them.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.680]   But it has a built-in outliner.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.720]   A lot of people don't know that.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.560]   Oh, I got to use that.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:04.600]   It has this--
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.480]   Anzac outliner.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.240]   So you can outline, and then it turns
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.800]   into a semantic drawing as well.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.160]   See, I fired it up, because I wanted
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.760]   to do diagram my social graph.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.840]   Like, what goes to-- not the graph, but the programs.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.640]   What platforms go to what-- so I could figure out
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.720]   where the loops were, so I could actually
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.800]   get a workflow going, where I tweet,
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.720]   and then it goes to buzz, and then it goes to friend fear,
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.400]   whatever.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.080]   And I thought omni-graff would be perfect for that.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:26.640]   But then I guess--
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.440]   Yeah, it would all almost be like a non-functional version
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.000]   of pipes.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.640]   It would be like--
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.160]   Yes, exactly.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:30.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.240]   Well, the name of the app is--
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.280]   there's the mind mapping app called Mind Node.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.680]   And I learned about it as an iPhone app.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.920]   And I mean, for the folks who are watching this on the video,
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.720]   I can at least show you that you can go in and pinch.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.440]   You can't see this.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:46.920]   Who am I falling?
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.720]   It's too bright, yeah.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.920]   But you can pinch in and out.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.200]   You run around and basically creating a new node, which
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.040]   is what they call one of those little branches.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.160]   You just take it and grab this little plus sign.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.600]   Oh, and it drags it around?
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.040]   Yeah, and then by just holding it and scooting it,
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.440]   you can move it into another area.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.920]   Oh, this is pretty sweet.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:02.600]   It is pretty neat.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.560]   It gives you a basic outline view, a textual outline view,
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.400]   that you can jump around with.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.520]   But you can't really do much with the outline.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.840]   It's really mainly to just kind of get you somewhere quickly.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.960]   But you'd be amazed if you sit there with this thing
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.120]   for a few minutes.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.160]   You get pretty fast at it.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.760]   Now, what's your use case?
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.040]   How do you use it?
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.680]   I am at the stage with my book where I know everything
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.240]   I want to say, and I've written a bunch of what I want to say.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.840]   And now I'm sort of doing the masonry of how it all fits
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.600]   together.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.040]   It's perfect for that.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.400]   I write in box zero in the middle of the page.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.040]   And then I create a new branch called introduction.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.720]   I'm actually at that weird stage where I'm actually
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.320]   kind of thinking about the order of it.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.400]   And so I'll go introduction.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.200]   OK, introduction.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.840]   Then branch one of introduction, Richard Scary book
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.480]   of the future.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.200]   Branch two of introduction, one knowledge
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.680]   of what goes hard, branch three, white email, sub branch,
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.320]   three things about email, and why it's hard.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.120]   And you can reattach and drag around.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.160]   So you have this kind of--
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.240]   anywhere, anywhere.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.360]   And you can pinch to zoom way in and way out.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.640]   Now, I have to say, again, this is going to sound crazy
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.800]   if you think this sounds like kind of like hippie artist stuff.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.040]   But these different modes, like typing versus long handwriting
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.800]   versus talking to people, these all really, I think--
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.640]   I'm not a neuroscientist, but it kind of
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.040]   stimulates a different part of your brain.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.720]   You start thinking differently.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.920]   So I love that.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.320]   I can do that.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.640]   Now, what's neat about that is there's
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.440]   standard that I had mostly known of for RSS feeds, which
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.720]   is called OPML, which is something
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.360]   the outline markup language.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.400]   And basically what it does is it's just XML for outlines.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.000]   So when you're done with your little--
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.240]   or for now, when you're done with this,
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.360]   you can actually go fire up--
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.120]   That's cool.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.640]   If you get MindNode Pro for the Mac, which is a desktop version
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.320]   of this, you can just pull it right over.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.560]   Or you can just open up the little port on your iPhone
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.760]   and download it as a free mind, OPML, ping, or whatever.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.200]   And it can turn on your Mac.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.320]   So it's really great.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.960]   No, no, that alone is great.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.560]   But that's not really an outliner.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.200]   And outlining is different from mind mapping.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.880]   For outlining, there is an amazing app--
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.040]   well, I don't know if it's amazing.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.440]   For the iPhone, it's amazing.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.440]   It's nothing compared on the outliner, in my opinion.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.320]   That's kind of a granddaddy of desktop.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.080]   Well, you know, and I can't wait to see what-- well, anyway.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.680]   I love this app called ZepdoLiner.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.600]   Z-E-P.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.800]   I didn't name it.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.120]   I don't name these things.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.480]   They be NCBD+.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.720]   I don't know where they come up for the names.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.080]   ZepdoLiner.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080]   ZepdoLiner.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:22.560]   ZepdoLiner.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.160]   Yeah, come on liner, exactly.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.000]   Exactly.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.640]   He's the one who was just in the first couple.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.480]   Went into management.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.080]   Poor Zepo.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.640]   It's painful.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.680]   He's an animal cracker, right?
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.520]   He just has like a really lame part.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.080]   He's the Mark's brother who didn't really have any talent.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:40.680]   No.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.480]   Whoa.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.640]   Now, ZepdoLiner, here's what I love about this.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.480]   Now, there's a special challenge that's obviously
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.240]   the iPhone.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.800]   And what I love about ZepdoLiner is it's pretty fast to just--
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.160]   what do you do with an outline?
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.000]   You create these spawn new entries very quickly,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.440]   and then you move them around by indent and out-dent,
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.840]   and then you rearrange, right?
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.320]   Right.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.080]   All of those things are super easy to do in this.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.720]   If you just want to make a sibling of whatever level
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.040]   you're at, you just hit the plus button.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.520]   It creates a new one.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.600]   And then you can-- if you pause for a second while you're
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.320]   holding down an entry, you can out-dent, indent, or out-dent.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.240]   And then it has-- what do they call it, hoisting?
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.200]   They call it an on the outline.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.720]   Or where you can just see this one area.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.120]   You can close up all the other ones.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.480]   Also, this works with OPML, and you
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.960]   can pull it over to your Mac.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.880]   And with OPML, basically, you can round-trip
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   between all of these apps.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.440]   It's not--
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.280]   That's kind of neat.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.080]   So OPML can describe an outline.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:32.840]   That's right.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.000]   Well, that's the funny part.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.160]   It sounds like you know it like I do,
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.240]   which is a way to move between news readers.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.440]   But I think-- I don't know if it's Dave Weiner thing or what,
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.040]   but if it started out, basically,
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.880]   as a way to express outlines.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.480]   Because it's really just parent and child relationships
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.360]   and siblings.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.200]   So anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.160]   That's a very long-winded.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.400]   But if you're like me and you think in outlines,
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.880]   I think this is a pretty great-- and there
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   are other good ones out there.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.720]   You should look around.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.240]   There are tons of them.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.000]   But I found this one very easy to use.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.240]   And the fact that you can pull any of the stove--
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.960]   I mean, how much is this like a thing now,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.240]   with things like pay spot, and all these different apps
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.120]   where you can throw things at your Mac and back?
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.040]   Zephtho liner is-- I don't know what it cost, Dane.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.840]   What does it cost, Dane?
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.880]   It's something like $8 maybe?
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880]   $8.99.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.840]   $8.99.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:22.240]   And then I went ahead and bought the $19 pro version of mine--
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.520]   Is that all it is?
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.320]   Well, for the desktop app of MindNote--
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320]   MindNote regular--
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.000]   They have a free version.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.440]   MindNote Prime is free.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.280]   And MindNote Pro is, I think, $19.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.360]   And the iPhone app is--
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.400]   $4.99.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.520]   $4.99.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.520]   But--
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.720]   Well, that's a pretty good-- for $25,
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.120]   and you get a pretty good set there.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.320]   If it helps you finish, my book gets worth everything.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.640]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.120]   No kidding.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.520]   I might take a look at this.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.000]   I've tried all the mind mappers out there.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   But this one looks very clean and simple.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.040]   Well, you know what's funny, Leo?
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.800]   It really is-- this is-- boy, if there's any application
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.440]   where I think probably IDEs and editors
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.560]   have got to be up there in terms of how it feels to you.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.840]   But I mean, there are some where you can open it
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.400]   and instantly know this is not for me,
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.120]   regardless of the features.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.840]   But I mean, some people swear by mine, I actually bought--
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.600]   I don't want to sound like Richie Rich or something.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.920]   I bought a copy of Personal Brain just because it is--
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.440]   Right.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.480]   Technologically, one of the most amazing applications.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.840]   I don't find much use for it.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.440]   But they use your field, so you kind of need to--
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.720]   Yeah, I can defend these ridiculous purchases.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.680]   Right, right.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.480]   You know what's funny is with mind mapping,
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.240]   I got to tell you, this sounds squirrely,
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.680]   but go buy a giant S36 pack of Pentel markers.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.400]   And a giant S piece of paper.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.760]   And if you do, follow Tony Boozans actual directions
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.840]   for doing a mind map.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:46.000]   You know, here, this is the first version of the Inbox Zero
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:46.160]   book.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.680]   And you can see I did all the actual stuff
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.320]   with like chains--
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:49.840]   It's pretty--
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.880]   --so as of the different colors and everything.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.240]   There's like a whole method on it.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.280]   And you're likely in order to vent you, you write backwards.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.560]   So I think that's kind of cool.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.000]   I do.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.200]   Yeah, I mostly have a dextrous.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.040]   You know, like the two Gershwin brothers.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.440]   Wow.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.240]   Yeah, Zepto Liner-- I'm sorry, that was so long.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.600]   Zepto Liner in Mind Node.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.240]   Andy in a hot call, you're pick of the week.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.320]   This is a little exercise in personal humility.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.800]   Because sometimes you see a product that comes out,
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.800]   and you're like, this has got to be about the single most
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.520]   useless thing I've ever seen.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.120]   That was actually brought to marketplace.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.880]   But then you realize later on that it wasn't
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.040]   that it was a useless product.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.280]   It was because either you didn't have the imagination
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.960]   to really figure out how to use it and what it meant.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.320]   Or it was useless for its time, but then it became
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.800]   a totally different thing as the world sort of changed
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.960]   a little bit around it.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   And so my pick is--
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.880]   you'll recognize this.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:44.400]   This is the from 10/1 design, the Pogo sketch stylus
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.680]   for the iPhone.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.520]   And here's where you start off with the-- this is useless.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.560]   Andy, you don't need a stylus for the iPhone.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.640]   It uses your-- you got gave you--
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.480]   Or you can use sausage or G sticks.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.480]   Exactly.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.720]   But there are two changes to that.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.280]   Number one, in cold weather, this will work through--
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.920]   even if you're holding it in your gloves,
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.720]   these will not work until you take your gloves off.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.600]   Given that I've just seen two documentaries about failed
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.680]   Everest missions in which the people who are survivors
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.280]   of the failed expeditions are gesturing like this.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.920]   And that's about as far as their hands go
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.440]   because their fingers got cut off because they took their gloves
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.440]   off from the cold.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.880]   Having one of these in cold weather
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.200]   is probably going to be better than taking your gloves off.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.680]   But the real big deal is that now that there are really,
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.000]   really good sketch programs for the iPhone,
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.400]   I found this is one of the best 15 bucks that I spent.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.680]   You can get them at any Apple store.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   Because I had this little moment where last week,
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.200]   I think I was recommending layers as a sketch program.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.360]   I've actually moved on to Autodesk's sketch program
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.880]   because it's a lot--
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.080]   I've learned how to use it better than my initial impressions
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:50.520]   of it.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.720]   And I found myself-- I was at a little--
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.160]   like one of those little outdoor malls where
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.080]   there's an Apple store over here and there's a little burger
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:56.640]   joint here.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.240]   So I was sort of curious about this as chiefly
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   as my second official iPad accessory.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.800]   I bought my Apple wireless Bluetooth keyboard
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.240]   as my first iPad accessory.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.600]   But I figured that this is probably
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.360]   going to be interesting for sketch programs on the iPad.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.120]   But I found myself just like as I was waiting for my food
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.360]   to be ready, just sitting there, like at my window seat,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.120]   and just like taking out the sketch program
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.040]   and just drawing what I was seeing throughout the window.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.240]   And I was really surprised at how quickly I was really
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.920]   getting into it because I was starting thinking,
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.760]   well, I never had any sort of color sense.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.440]   Also, managing watercolors and managing colors
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.080]   is not an easy thing to do, like in the field.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.480]   But it's like, OK, there's a blue sky.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.120]   So let's just do the top half of the screen as blue
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.480]   and the parking lot is sort of gray.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.640]   So let's pick up a gray.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.360]   Let's start filling the gray in the bottom.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.480]   And on the distance there, you see the line of stores.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.440]   It's sort of a sandstone.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.880]   Let's find a sandstone color.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.800]   Color that.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.200]   And I kept getting into, well, OK, now let's put in the details
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.480]   for this bush here and this other store here
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.160]   and this awning, which is purple.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.360]   And my burger arrived and was getting cold
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.520]   because I just found myself really getting into just drawing
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.640]   with this thing in my hand in a way that
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.520]   drawing with my fingertips just never really happened.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.560]   And it was really a lovely little moment
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.960]   because it underscored the reasons why the iPhone is
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.720]   one of my favorite pieces of technology
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.920]   because I find that we talk often about apps that really
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.440]   work well for those idle moments.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.000]   But you just have five or 10 minutes
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   and you don't need to spend three hours working on a game,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.520]   but you do want to spend a few minutes just being distracted
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.200]   or something.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.920]   And it turns out that the more I use my iPhone,
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.200]   the more I'm filling those idle moments with creativity,
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.920]   with creating things, doing things
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.120]   that I would not be doing otherwise,
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.520]   I will not show you screenshots of my art skills
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.200]   because it's just pretty pathetic.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.880]   I mean, this is something that this is--
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.520]   this is-- well, if you hold up really, really close,
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.560]   you'll see that this is an absolutely perfect--
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.080]   It's beautiful.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.040]   It's a photo realistic, but I wish I could show you
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.320]   the rest of the screen because the rest of this painting
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.520]   is just beautiful.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.720]   I mean, but that's not a--
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.360]   Hey, Andy and Arthur, call that a detail.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:01.880]   Detail.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.360]   Exactly.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.760]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.960]   The jicily prints will be available in 30 days for $800.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.360]   But the point is not that it's great art,
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.280]   but the point is that instead of spending five or 10 minutes
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.960]   this morning watching TV or just doing something silly,
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.280]   I was just like, yeah, I think my iPhone,
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.120]   the thing was next to the stylist was next to the thing.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.200]   I wanted to see if I could figure out
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.760]   which app I was going to show off today.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.240]   And I was finding myself sketching and doodling,
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.480]   and then fast forward 50 minutes later.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.760]   I've been using various parts of my brain that otherwise
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.120]   I don't normally use.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.480]   So this is going to be a really--
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.600]   I really do think this is going to be a very, very cool tool
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.440]   to have when you get your iPad.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.360]   But also, it's such a wonderful enhancement
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.120]   to any drawing app that you might have.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.400]   The other thing is-- but they do have two different kinds.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.160]   They have the Pogo stylus and the Pogo sketch.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:59.160]   The sketch is the only one that has this shirt clip,
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.400]   this pocket clip, which is absolutely essential,
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.800]   I think you have to agree.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.680]   As it is, I was sort of disappointed
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   that it doesn't come with a cap, because the way it works
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.240]   is that you get this little conductive tip,
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240]   looks like a--
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.080]   - It's flexible.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080]   - --seeker it, right.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.920]   And I can just imagine having to buy a new one of these
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.760]   every couple months if I'm always carrying this around with me.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.840]   And I'm like, geez, you know what?
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:24.680]   For $14, even an 89 cent big banana pen
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.320]   gives me a plastic clip like a snap on the end of it
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.520]   to protect, it's 2 cent tip.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.880]   So that's the only disappointment about it.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.840]   But honestly, if I have as much fun with this,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.320]   like over the next month as I did over the past two or three
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.680]   days, I could definitely see myself just having a couple
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.040]   in the drawer and replacing them as I get worn out.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.280]   It really did make my iPhone a lot more fun.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.400]   - More-- - And also just for what it's worth
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.720]   theoretically, theoretically.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.680]   In the next three hours and 24 minutes,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.520]   you could buy it for $13.49 and have it tomorrow from Amazon.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.200]   - Just cool. - FYI.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.200]   - And I think somebody might have--
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.800]   - Which is that would improve plants versus zombies?
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.680]   It's gonna come faster than your pizza at this point.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.520]   - Geez, I don't know what's taking this guy so long.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.360]   I'm so getting this, that is so cool, Andy.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.560]   - Yeah, I wanna buy one too.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.040]   - I just buy everything everybody recommends.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.000]   I just go around, I'm really glad Scott's not here anymore
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.880]   because I was just getting-- - He was getting a mortgage
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.960]   on the house. - It's getting bright.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.440]   We'll get Scott back just so that you can spend more money.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.280]   - I know.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.040]   - Hey, before I get to my pick, I just wanted somebody
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.920]   in the chatroom sent me a really interesting link
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.240]   from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.760]   Fred von Lohmann, who's one of their attorneys there,
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.520]   did his legal analysis of the iPhone developer program
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.760]   license agreement.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.880]   You might say, "Well, wait a minute, how do you get it?"
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.160]   Turns out NASA, the National Air and OX
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.560]   and Space Administration, did an iPhone app
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.880]   and is required by the law of the land
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.040]   when given a Freedom of Information Act request to pony up.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.400]   - Wow. - So the EFF did an FOIA request
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.920]   to NASA. - Wow.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.680]   - NASA sent them a copy of the March 19th,
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.520]   March 17th, the '09 version of the iPhone agreement
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.760]   and it is amazingly draconian.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   (laughing)
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.480]   I mean, you couldn't get Nastier
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.800]   and it's well worth reading at EFF.org
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.280]   in their deep links section.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.880]   And we'll probably talk about it next week,
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.760]   but you know, it really is kind of a germane
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.720]   to the conversation we were having
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.720]   about the Mac Heist and developers and so forth
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.680]   because essentially what Apple's saying is,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.600]   "We own you, we are the Walmart of distribution
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.920]   "for iPhone apps, Walmart, Tower Records,
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.720]   "Target, JC Penney's all rolled into one."
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.400]   And just, I mean, the things that you have to give up
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.120]   to be an iPhone developer, and people do
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.120]   because there's no other choice are really dramatic.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.120]   Ban on public statements, of course, we knew about,
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.560]   applications have to be distributed in the App Store,
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.480]   no other way.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.240]   There's a ban on reverse engineering.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.040]   You cannot tinker with any Apple products,
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.360]   any Apple products, not just the iPhone
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.640]   or enable others to do so.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.840]   - Tinker? - Tinker.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.880]   - Is that really the language?
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.840]   - No, I'm sure it says you will not quote.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.600]   - You will not, through the use of the Apple software
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.880]   services or otherwise, create any application
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.920]   or other program that would disable hack
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.640]   or otherwise interfere with the security solution
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.040]   or any security digital signing,
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.520]   digital rights management, verification,
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.640]   authentication mechanisms, implement it in
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.520]   or buy the iPhone operating system software,
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.920]   iPod touch operating software, this Apple software,
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.320]   any services or other Apple software technology
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.680]   or enable others to do so.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.440]   Apple can kill your app at any time
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.520]   and they never owe you more than $50 in damages,
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.960]   no matter how badly they screw you.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960]   - It's like the opposite of your ATM card.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.000]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.840]   - Like where you're only ever gonna get $50 right.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.360]   - Yeah, that's the most,
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.360]   I think like your fourth iPad award should go to.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.400]   You're, that run of you like reading that agreement,
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.840]   if someone's gonna auto tune that into a really good song.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:55.120]   (laughing)
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.720]   - If you do a really good job.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:59.480]   - Our affinity is limit to $50.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.680]   - I will give you an iPad if you do a really good job
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.680]   but only as judged by Andy, Alex and Merlin.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.200]   - Well it's the, you know, it's, I always look,
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.440]   I mean, I just look at the kind of stuff
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.640]   like it's the rules of the game.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.840]   I mean, they're setting the rules.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.040]   - When you dominate like this, when you're a monopoly.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.760]   - When you sign up, those are the rules, you know,
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.120]   and they're laying them out.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.560]   So, and it obviously, I think the real prop Apple has
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.920]   is just not enough people are taking up on that agreement.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.240]   I think that agreement's scaring a lot of developers away.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.000]   - Good, well that's why I'm glad Android exists
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.760]   because there is an alternative, right?
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.320]   So meanwhile, let me show you an iPhone application.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.720]   Ubisoft and Game Loft created this.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.920]   This is a game that I loved.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.040]   In fact, I played this with Henry
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.760]   when he was little for a long time.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.280]   It's called Rayman 2 and they have taken the entire game,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.840]   which was a PC game, very elaborate,
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:49.520]   and they have actually ported the whole thing
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.760]   to the iPhone graphics and all.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.080]   And it's really a fun game.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.520]   I mean, I played hours and hours of this.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.600]   It is fairly expensive.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.080]   I can't remember exactly what it's a cost but it's--
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.560]   - It means more than 99 cents.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.600]   - Yeah, more than 99 cents.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.000]   I think it's seven or eight dollars.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.040]   Let me turn up the sound.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:05.880]   - Setting us back.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.480]   - Yeah, but it's a crazy economy
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.440]   that we've gotten into though with the iPhone.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   It's, this is a French game.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.920]   And so it has a very kind of weird look
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.680]   but it's really a fun game.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.320]   And you know, the controls are not too bad.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.200]   - That looks great.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:23.880]   I mean, it's amazing.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.840]   It just shows you what they're able to do
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.760]   on a modern iPhone platform.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.360]   I mean, this was a PC game.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.880]   This was a tough first person shooter PC game.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.720]   But good for the kids.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.800]   I mean, it wasn't, you know, you play Rayman,
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.640]   this cute character.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.120]   You can jump and you can fire fireballs and stuff like that.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.320]   - Really, it really sounds like you're saying
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.720]   Rayman just for what it's worth.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.560]   - R-A-Y.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.400]   - Definitely.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.200]   - Definitely an excellent game.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.520]   Excellent game, excellent game.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.880]   Let me jump through this whole--
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.800]   - And it's the Whoppner.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:51.640]   Oh boy.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.480]   - Oh boy.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.840]   Definitely 52, 52.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.680]   There we go.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.520]   - A water burn baby.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.360]   - Oh boy, here we go.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.200]   - Level up.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.040]   - Level up.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.280]   - It crashes every time.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.120]   - Every time it crashes.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:00.960]   - Every time it crashes.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.800]   - It definitely crashes.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.640]   - That's about $100.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:04.760]   - This is really a fun game.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.400]   I have to say, I spent hours on this on the PC, so.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.240]   - Dang it.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.080]   - Just shows you.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.640]   - That looks like the exact sort of game that I like.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.160]   - Yeah, it's kind of a platformer.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.000]   It's not violent.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:14.840]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.920]   It's very quirky.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.800]   It's some very challenging jumping things.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.520]   It's like, it's basically the first person platformer,
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.360]   I would guess.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.200]   - First watch of this, I just go,
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.840]   when is someone gonna port Marathon to, yeah, iPhone?
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.880]   - Well, we could pull off those graphics.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.040]   - Yeah, it's really remarkable.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.040]   Very fluid, works beautifully.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.880]   This is a cut scene, of course, but it does a great job.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.120]   It wasn't the most challenging game, I'm sure.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.280]   This is a few years old.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:42.160]   He speaks to kind of a weird French pigeon.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.360]   And there's fairies, so that's good.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.840]   Definitely fairies.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.360]   So there you go, that's my pick of the week.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.680]   Rayman to the iPhone, another great time-waster for you.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.640]   As if we didn't need more, I'm still doing plants
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.960]   versus zombies like Crazy Fact.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.680]   Alex and I, for those of you who turn in a little early
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.080]   to wear broadcasts every Tuesday, live.twit.tv.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.680]   Alex and I do a little masterclass
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.280]   in plants versus zombies so far.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.920]   - Yes, we do, and before every show,
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.080]   there's a little bit of a,
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.640]   we chat about the different strategies.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.960]   - Yeah, I show him my current level,
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:14.000]   and he helps me out with the picks and so forth.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.760]   It's really, it's excellent for anybody
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.000]   who wants to become a better plants versus--
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.760]   - I'm like, ah, that plant is in worth $20,000.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.160]   - Yeah, I wasted a lot of money on that.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:23.480]   Save yourself.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.000]   - I have to say, this game has a lot.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.440]   This plant versus zombies, if you're gonna pick one game--
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.000]   - Don't do it. - It's pretty easy to pick up.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:29.840]   I mean, what is it?
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.680]   - Oh, that's the problem.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.520]   - It's way too easy to pick up. - That's the problem.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.240]   It's easy. - It's kind of strangely--
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.240]   - Is it easy to pick up?
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:36.840]   Not so easy to put that hard.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.720]   - I'm getting it right now.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.480]   - Strangely addicted. - No, no, don't do it.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.160]   Merlin, step away from the phone right now.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.000]   - It's too late. - That was me
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:45.840]   with what the team told me.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.840]   - I just have to remember. - I need the zombies
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.680]   are coming.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.280]   You gotta pick your weapons here,
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.160]   so you got the little mushroom
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.640]   and the little free shooter.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.760]   - Just put the needle down, Merlin.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.720]   - Yeah, that's good. - Merlin, I've been there.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.320]   I'm still there. - Yeah, and then Alex recommends
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.280]   a walnut and a shooter.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.640]   - All of your loved ones are outside here.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.520]   We just wanna talk for a few minutes
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.160]   about how you're caving is affecting your relationship.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.120]   - Yeah, no, this is-- - You have to talk.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.320]   We just want you to listen.
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.160]   - This is good.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.200]   Here's a little balloon player.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.040]   All right. - You have to do
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:14.880]   a whole podcast on--
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.720]   - Oh, wait a minute, first is zombie.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.040]   - I forgot to put a lily pad in there.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.840]   See any more slots?
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.160]   So you say live with the fog, is that what you say?
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.640]   All right, a little fog. - I live with the fog.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.600]   I've gotten pretty good at it.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.600]   - Yes, Andy?
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.480]   - I found that the thing was a crutch.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.160]   - You forgot the sign off the show.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.320]   - Oh, oh, oh, golly, maybe I should end the show.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.960]   (laughing)
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.080]   - For I, just so you can plant for zombies,
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.840]   just twips, twips.
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.240]   - Plant, twips? - Twips.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.040]   - Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.480]   We thank you, especially Andy and Aco for suffering
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:48.440]   through the Skype madness, the insanity, to get here.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.240]   It wasn't easy, but Andy did it.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.320]   Worse than a snowstorm.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.240]   That wall needed to hold it in anyway.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.680]   (laughing)
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.160]   - Andy writes with the Chicago Sun times,
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.360]   catches great work there, and of course on his website,
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.960]   cwob.com.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.520]   Thank you for being here, and we'll see you next week.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.120]   Merlin Mann. - Oh, man.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.680]   - You are the man, Merlin Mann.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.920]   - Hi. - The pizza come?
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.320]   The pizza came, didn't it?
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.880]   (laughing)
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.720]   He's gone.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.080]   The pizza came. - Pizza came.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:14.920]   - Pizza's here.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.440]   Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.680]   also the host of the very, very funny and well worth
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.240]   downloading and subscribing to You Look Nice Today.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.480]   Hello, Merlin.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.860]   Was that your pizza? - Oh, hi.
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:26.700]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:30.080]   I was just here looking over some pamphlets.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.320]   (laughing)
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.120]   - Oh. - Pizza got her.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.240]   It's kind of like jerk.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.400]   - Was he? - Yeah.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.720]   - Did you say, "Hey, I'm on the air right now,
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.640]   can you just be quiet?"
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.480]   - You know, that would make me sound certifiably insane.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.400]   (laughing)
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.000]   - Could you deliver my pizza faster,
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.720]   'cause I'm on an internet radio show.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.960]   (laughing)
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.720]   43folders.com.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:53.560]   - I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.080]   I'm so, that was selfish and it was wrong.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.520]   - Show me the pizza.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.520]   - You wanna see it? - Yeah.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.480]   - Okay, hang on.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.640]   - It's a meat buster.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.600]   What do you say?
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.960]   It's a little meaty.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.800]   That's what he said.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.400]   He says, "Little meaty." - That's the word.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.760]   - It's a little meaty, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.600]   Here it is.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.320]   Boy, that's-- - Are you ready?
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.160]   - Okay.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.000]   - Oh, brother.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.400]   Look at this. - Oh, look at this.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.920]   - Oh, man, the meat lover's special,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.480]   linguista. - Yeah, linguista.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.320]   Yeah. - You have this.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.480]   - That's from Portugal. - You know what?
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.800]   I've been inspired, Merlin, because oftentimes,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.160]   I buy things like during the show that have been recommended
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.760]   during these picks of the week segments.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.680]   For counting purposes, I'm gonna say that that was one
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.640]   of your picks of the week, which allows me to buy myself
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.040]   a pizza for dinner. - It is!
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.280]   Merlin's pick.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.720]   - Based on Merlin's recommendation.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.200]   - Yes, linguista.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.040]   - Yeah, you know, and it's only like,
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.800]   one-eighth of an Alex?
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.720]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.560]   That's a good deal.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.000]   - I think we're down with it. - That's good.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.200]   - One day now. - You rescued me
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.280]   from reheated beans and rice from yesterday.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.240]   It was just gotta be, it was my Tuesday night play.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.200]   - You know, Andy, I've been a fan of yours forever,
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.880]   and I just care about the Mac community.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:53.520]   So maybe everybody could get a pizza.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.680]   - He's a giver.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.320]   He's a, you know, with the love and the thing.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.040]   It kills me that no one ever knows about the work you do
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.880]   for your many charitable causes.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.640]   - This telephonic has two different points to it.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.360]   - Alex Lindsey is at the Pixelcorpixelcorp.com
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:10.320]   to join that 3D group of multimedia artists
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.920]   and learn as well as work.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.720]   He also does podcasts, a bunch of them,
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.400]   including this week of Photography,
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.320]   from PMA at Pixelcorp.tv.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.720]   - We got a lot of good response.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.920]   We're starting to get the hang of covering these events.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.600]   So between the Macbreak video and PMA, PMA is a new,
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.440]   people should check it out.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.920]   People, PMA is a slightly different approach
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.160]   where we added two or three segments per,
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.160]   rather than sending out.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.000]   - Not one, one, one, one.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.840]   - We recorded 27 episodes in about three hours.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.440]   And so we were like, you know, let's not put them all out.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.120]   You know, so we clumped them together
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.280]   into some groups that make sense.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.600]   So we'd love to hear what people think of it.
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.120]   So go up to, listen, go to download this week in Photography
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.040]   and then go to Twiplog and tell us what you think.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.320]   - I'll be at South by Southwest this week.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.440]   I'm really excited about that.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.960]   I'm really, are you going this year?
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.520]   - I'll be in my node trying to finish my book.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:47:59.600]   - Oh, so sorry.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.800]   - No, you guys go have fun.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.320]   Now, you know, I think you gotta have a buy year.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.320]   They call it a rebuilding year.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.160]   - It's your buy year.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.280]   - I think that's my buy year.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.440]   I hope you guys have fun.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.160]   - That makes me sad 'cause it's my first year.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.000]   I've never been there.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:09.840]   - And none of us are there.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.760]   - And none of you are going.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.960]   But I'm gonna be there and I have a Gandalf cane,
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.000]   a staff with attached to it, a camera, a light,
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.840]   a microphone, I have on my back, a live streaming.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.080]   - Are you just the weekend or is it?
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.680]   - I'm going Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.840]   and Sunday night, I will be broadcasting.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.520]   Until the batteries die, we're gonna do the live
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.440]   dignity thing and I'm going to nerd surf.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.240]   Kevin Rose has invited me to come up on the stage
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.720]   during dignity on Saturday night.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:36.400]   And he says, we're gonna crowd surf.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.800]   I said, what do you mean crowd surf?
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.960]   You mean like with like, like,
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.360]   Iggy Pop roll on glass?
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.200]   What are you talking about?
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.840]   He says, yeah, Merlin.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:44.680]   - Right here, come on.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.680]   (laughing)
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.160]   - No, listen, you're gonna go out to a pink pop
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.440]   crowd surf, Iggy Pop, broken glass.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.280]   - I'm boring you.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:54.480]   No, no, if I had a piece of pizza down there on the floor,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.240]   I'd be doing the same thing, exactly the same thing.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.760]   - Kevin Rose, he's done some great work out.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.840]   - Anyway, so I'm gonna have my Merlin staff.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.440]   So it will be a very interesting, different kind of coverage.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.960]   All live, we're gonna do cut downs on our specials channel.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.160]   There is a new Twitch specials channel in iTunes
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.360]   and subscribe to that.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.360]   So one channel, because we're gonna start doing a lot of live stuff.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.800]   We're gonna do Dragoncon in September.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.600]   I just agreed to do Lou Webb in Paris.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.120]   - We did a test with the new box yesterday.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.120]   - The live stream. - Yeah, that's gonna be incredible.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:22.960]   - Gosh, it was so awesome.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.080]   - Yeah, and we're great quality.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.480]   - Are you saying that I now have a tax deductible reason
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.560]   to go to Dragoncon?
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.760]   - Yes, you do, sir.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.600]   - Yes, you do.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.920]   - The challenge for our live coverage from Atlanta, Georgia,
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.760]   Labor Day weekend.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.280]   (laughing)
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.560]   - I'm just thinking about the picture I saw from Dragoncon
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.320]   two years ago with the 40 slave leas having a pillow flight.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:45.560]   - Yes, slave leo, slave lea and Leo all together.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.720]   - We're on the sleeve.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.560]   - Oh my God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.400]   slave Leo, slave Leo.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:51.240]   - That's a picture.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.040]   - That's me, I'm slave Leo with the brass bra
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.800]   and the ponytail.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.880]   - Hello, retweet.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.400]   (laughing)
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.520]   - Moitianizing, moitianizing myself.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:05.000]   - No, we realized that one of the things we really do well,
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.160]   in fact, is live coverage of these kinds of events.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:09.240]   So we've got, we're building this technology
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.480]   so that we can do it and we're gonna do more
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.320]   and more of these events.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.800]   Loeb, I just agreed with Loeb to go to Paris
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.280]   in December and cover Loeb with Twit.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.520]   We'll be doing Dragoncon, we'll be doing,
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.080]   I think we're gonna try in June,
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.920]   they're doing a Maker Faire in Detroit.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.760]   It's June or July, we're gonna try to cover that in Detroit.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.040]   I think that'll be really, really fun.
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.480]   - The Maker Faire here is in May, right?
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.240]   - Yeah, in San Mateo, but that's too easy.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.080]   - Yes, too easy.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.160]   - I wanna go to Detroit.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.240]   - You wanna junk it.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.960]   - I wanna junk it, it's all about the junkets, baby.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.280]   - Yeah, and they have great, by the way,
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.720]   great Greek food in Detroit.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:40.880]   I'm just saying.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.320]   - I like it, I like it, I'll eat a souvelock.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.240]   - State theater's great there.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.120]   - State theater?
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.720]   - If there's anyone playing, I saw a great,
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.200]   I saw some fans playing theater, it's great theater.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.240]   - So I think we've really driven this entire show
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.440]   deep into the ground.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.480]   - Let's just start over, Leo.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480]   - Can we just do it again?
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.560]   I think it wasn't, you know.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.400]   - Let's start over.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.000]   - It wasn't quite the way I wanted it.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.040]   - Stupid Skype, guys, darn it's good,
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.720]   I'm starting to go and swag with stupid stuff.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.880]   - Steve Jobs, Ably, you know.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.600]   - Andy started prospector cursing.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.440]   - iPhone.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.280]   (laughing)
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.400]   - Hey, there's a radio.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.240]   - Hey, there's a car, how did that--
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.360]   - He's in a restricted way, it did be.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.080]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.520]   for being here, we appreciate it,
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.960]   and I know you wasted a good hour and a half of your life
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.840]   and you'll never get it back, but hey.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.280]   - You're gonna get help, you're doing something else
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.120]   to make it worth it.
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.160]   - Yeah, we'll see you next time.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.800]   Get back to work.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.960]   Anybody want some pizza?
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.520]   - Bring time, it's over.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:37.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:45.000]   (upbeat music)
