[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for MacBreak Weekly.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Scott Borne is here from the, I don't know what you call
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   the boring labs in gig haba, but that's what I call them.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It's the Born Laboratory.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   The Born Laboratory.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Right here in beautiful downtown,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Gig Harbor, Washington.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   best one-day vacation in America and what they really beat
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   is after a day, you're sick of it.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Not sick, just done.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   There's nothing more to see.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   There's not a lot to see.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We got six restaurants.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We got six restaurants.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Well, then you could stay there three days.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You have two meals a day and breakfast you're on your own.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Gig Hab, I just like saying gig haba,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   even though it's in Washington state,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   has nothing to do with Maine.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's just, I've gone over the entire city looking for anybody
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   that talks like that so far.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Not one.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I know we're going to call it.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   We're going to call it the Born Supremacy in Gig Hab.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Alex is from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hello.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm in the room of silence rather than the con.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I have a whole room.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You do, in fact, we're not joking when you say not only does it
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   a room of silence, it's a room of no color.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And soft.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It is very...
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's 50% gray.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It is.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Well, it's actually 18% gray.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Oh, it is 18% gray.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I actually handed, it's a gray card that you used in film.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   When I handed the guy was going to paint,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I just handed him a gray card and I said, I just wanted to be that color.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.920]   I was talking about that with my friend Scott Wilkinson, who does our home theater stuff
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   on the show.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.000]   And he also has an 18% gray room to review HD TVs.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's the best.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I mean, it's neutral.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So you're not going to...
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You're not going to make it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The windows are all sealed.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Tough getting the white to approve that color choice.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's a little...
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's a little grim.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   A little dark.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I mean, it's a little dark.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I mean, it's a little dark.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean, I like to give it a mix of colors.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'm seeing the new paint color.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It makes colors more vibrant.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   See, because it's the background.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It goes into the background.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm talking about the new...
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Vibrant colors are going to talk about the new Mac books in just a bit.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.800]   But before we do, and I'm still trying to get Andy Inako on, and I'm not sure if he's
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   having trouble.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.200]   He sometimes has trouble with his Skype.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   You know how that is.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.800]   I can virtually hear the howls of pain all the way from Boston.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   But as soon as we can get him on, we will.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Also, I've asked Arnold Kim to join us.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Let me see if he's going to be available.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, he's going to be available.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Let me get him on to talk about the Mac rumors in just a bit.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   What he wants to do, what he did on...
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He, of course, runs MacRumors.com.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He graded the rumors on the laptop.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And I thought that was very interesting.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Who got it right?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Who got it wrong?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   What we can do is from future rumors.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.800]   But before we do that, there's a lot of concern and interest in the internet community about
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.000]   our friend, Liana LaHua.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So we just wanted to give you an update on that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Liana has been on three different Mac break weeklies.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   She was the host of Girls Gone Geek at Girls Gone Geek TV and FitTorn, which is all about
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   fitness, the Apple iPhone show, and also of the iLifeZone.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And Scott, you know her very well.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I know she was a close colleague.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   She is not well right now.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   No, actually, all of us go back with Liana to the time that you and Alex and I did the
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Gear Media Tech Conference.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's right.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And that's where we all got to know her best.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And she stood out amongst many of the students there as a great prospect.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And I took her under my wing and we became great friends.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And you and Alex have both done a lot to help her as well.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And she's propelled to, you know, pretty close to what you call internet stardom.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   She's a good person.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   She's very talented.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Most people don't really know anything about her.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   They think they do because she's such a social butterfly.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   She's really quite a private person.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   But her background is significant.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   She's worked in very significant positions at Disney and at House of Blues.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   She spent a long time working for the Wayans Brothers, the famous comedy team that you
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   see on HBO and Home to Living Color.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And she designed Damon Wayans Online Presents.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   She's got some significant chops.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   People think because she's this little four foot eleven hundred pound girl with, you know,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   she's nothing.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And she runs marathon.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   She's in her 40s and she's going to kill me for divulging all this by.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I had no idea.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   She looks like she's 28.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, she's in her 40s and she's in excellent condition.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   She's a triathlete.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   She's a triathlete.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Unfortunately, Anna is in critical condition in an Orange County hospital in the ICU with
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   bacterial pneumonia.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Now she's probably going to kick my butt when she gets out because she just really doesn't
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   like people in her business at all.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But I just think the word has got out.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   People know about it now.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's just getting too crazy to not talk about it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   There was kind of a misguided attempt to do a marathon fundraiser for the studio that
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   she, does she run the Patango studio?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, I resigned in July and my ex-partners put her in charge of the studio after I left.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I think a lot of attention went to that, but that really wasn't about Leona.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And so, you know, I'm partly to blame for this.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I've blogged about it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And as I understand, Adam has not only stopped the marathon and returned all the money that
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   we all want to focus on Leona.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   She's going to be taking care of what she gets out of the hospital.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   There's nothing to worry about that.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But our real focus right now is on her health and to send her our good wishes.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Furthermore, to raise awareness of this disease because I had no idea, but we talked a little
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   bit about on Twitter, this has become a serious killer.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah, bacterial pneumonia is responsible for a lot of deaths in this country.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and I had no idea.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's like these bacterial resistant staff infections.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now we've got these bacterial resistant, or I'm sorry, antibiotic resistant bacterial bacteria
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   out there that is just deadly.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And you can get it just by a random cough or a sneeze, right?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I mean, we don't know.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You just walk by a person that sneezed that has that bacteria or you, you know, it's often
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   passed, for instance, if you go into a room that's got air conditioning, if the air conditioner
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   has been properly maintained.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.400]   I mean, basically it's easy to get and just most people have the immune system to fight
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.000]   it off for whatever reason, and the honor wasn't able to.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   You'd think she would because, I mean, of all people, she had, she absolutely has.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Yeah, but you know, here's the thing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And if she was here, she'd laugh and be mad at me at the same time, but this is one potato
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   chip eating girl.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Okay.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I mean, to have a food kills, to have a body like that and to be able to eat a whole bag
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   of potato chips at a time, something is very wrong with that.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.880]   I don't know that her nutrition was as good as it should have been subdyes, but I, here's
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.200]   the thing, you know, I've talked with a lot of doctors about this since this all happened
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.280]   and they all told me, look, this could happen to anybody in your audience tomorrow.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   It's just luck of the draw.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.000]   I don't think Leon did anything wrong.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's very fine.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's just the way it is now.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.480]   It just so happens her body is not responding to the drugs and this is her third day in a
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120]   row in ICU and that's not good.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   The good news is that the killers, this disease is a killer mostly for elderly people and
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.640]   weak people and Leona is both young and strong.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   So if somebody's going to beat this, it's going to be Leona.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.840]   And you know, we have had a couple of real good job offers come in for her and those who
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   are worried about her afterwards, you know, give us a job offer.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   If you want to do that, we'll have 12 for her to pick from.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   So that's not a problem.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.640]   I hope we get to that problem.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.120]   She's going to be taken care of.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.280]   There's no, yeah, she's not.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   There's no need to be.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   Her family is with her right now.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.000]   I know Alex, you've been in touch with her and I know you have as well, Scott.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.560]   So we're going to respect your privacy and let her recover in peace, but we will keep
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.760]   you up to date on how she's feeling.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.080]   And we just let's have her back on the show as soon as she's well enough.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   Let's do that.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   Absolutely.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080]   You can.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   We can all laugh about this.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   She's going to want to.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.040]   She's really going to be bummed that she missed the Mac book announcement and she's going
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   to want to get in on.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   All right.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   I'm also going to want to talk about heroes because our friend David Lawrence is the new
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   villain.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Isn't that great?
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.960]   Wow.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.040]   She would have been all over that.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.120]   She would have been at the heroes party last night.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.280]   She would have been freaking out.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   She loves that stuff.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   A bigger villain I can't imagine than David.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   What's really weird?
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.080]   The guy worked for me 15 years ago.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   We did a radio show.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.280]   The first nationally syndicated shows on the real radio about the internet called "line
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.800]   phone line radio" and to have a guy that worked for me now be on TV.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.360]   And he just sat and told me at NAB at April, you're not going to be an actor now.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   He's an actor.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   How do you do that?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   It's truly amazing.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   Well, you worked very hard at it.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.920]   He went to a lot of auditions.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.360]   He actually gave up his radio career to pursue it full time.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.920]   You got to give him props, man.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   He pulled it off.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   He did it.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   I'm really proud of him.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   It's really cool.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   All right.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   I'm going to bring in Arnold Kim right now.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.520]   Arnold is the editor in chief of Mac Rumors.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.600]   We've had him on the show before and still waiting again, Andy and not going, "Hi, Arnold.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.760]   Thanks for joining us."
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.480]   Hey, thanks for asking.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.240]   So we got the new laptops and we're going to give our reviews of the new laptops in
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.880]   just a bit because I know, Scott, you got one.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   I did.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   And I got one.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.200]   I ended up unable to hold back.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.640]   And we should have bought it the day after it was released instead of the day before.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.800]   I waited a couple of days and I had a DOA as a matter of fact, but we'll talk about
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   that in just a little bit.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.480]   But I also want to say, did you get one, Alex?
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.240]   I haven't got one yet, but I'm going to get one of the next two or two.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   I just haven't been busy.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.480]   I haven't been able to get.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.240]   I know Arnold, you've probably seen four or five come through Mac Rumors.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.720]   I just saw them in the Apple Store.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.240]   I'm actually pretty happy with my air, so I'm not going to be good.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   Yeah, you know, if you have an air, I think there probably isn't a lot of reason to go
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.120]   out and run out and buy the new one.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:53.080]   But I thought you did a great article this morning on the Mac rumor mill and a wrap up
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.040]   on the winners and losers.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   First of all, let me ask you.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:04.440]   I know that the guy who I used to do think secret did a kind of a survey of Mac rumor
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:12.560]   sites and found that Apple just wasn't as litigious as they have been in the past about
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   this stuff.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.600]   I think it's really gotten a cease and desist letter in a long time.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.800]   Is that your experience also?
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.880]   Yeah, I think for whatever reason for the past year, Apple hasn't been as aggressive
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.440]   about these product image leaks that have been appearing, which is very different from
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.040]   how it's been in the past.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.760]   In the past, if a legitimate photo appears of an unreleased product, Apple would quickly
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:43.200]   send their legal team to descend on everyone to try to stamp them out with limited success.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.000]   The internet is hard to eliminate all traces of an image on the internet.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.760]   Also, doing so is in a way an admission that it's accurate.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   Sure.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   No, and there was a lot of...
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   It's like, oh, I guess we got it right.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   Right.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.920]   There's a lot of confirmation that comes with the Apple cease and desist because they've
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.200]   never really sent cease and desist.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.840]   I don't know, I mean, legally, they'd have no grounds to send cease and desist on something
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.720]   that wasn't real or that they didn't own the property.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.560]   The intellectual property.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.280]   So maybe that's why they stopped, but I think the side effect of this has been that the
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.800]   rumor mill has been uncannily accurate this year.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.920]   Yeah, I'm not sure if it's related.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.840]   I mean, I think there's two parts.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.960]   There's another part probably to Apple's reluctance to try to do anything is that there's a lot
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.920]   more media attention on Apple and the rumors.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.480]   And then there's corporate back sites like Engadget, which is backed by AOL, who are
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.840]   unlikely to pull photos.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   So it might just be sort of...
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   They'll fight back.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   Right.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.000]   They won't let me know for how hobbyist sites, especially like, you know, the way Mac rumors
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.800]   has had grown and, you know, think secret.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.120]   Nick was a college student at, you know, I mean, he started as a teenager.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   Right.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.440]   He didn't have the resources to fight.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.560]   In a way, it's sad because he's kind of the last victim of Apple's attempts.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   Right.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   I mean, victim.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.360]   It sounds like he was pretty happy with however the settlement went down.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   I don't know.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   I don't know the details.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.560]   Maybe he wasn't such a victim, in other words.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   Right.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680]   Well, people were speculating about why Apple would settle and it seems like everyone sort
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.920]   of came out of winter.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.680]   Is my contention correct that the rumors have been more accurate this year than ever before?
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.160]   One of the things Mac rumors really is kind of an aggregator of all the rumors.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   Right.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.200]   So you'd probably know better than anybody.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   I think...
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.480]   I mean, I think it might be fair to say.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.120]   I think it sort of comes and goes.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.640]   There have definitely been times in the past where everything, you know, things have leaked.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.440]   But it probably would be fair to say that this round, everything was sort of exposed
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.200]   a few days or maybe...
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.760]   Well, definitely by the night before.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   We certainly...
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   We knew pretty much what was good.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   The only thing that didn't happen was the $800 MacBook.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   Right.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.000]   And that sort of came from a...
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.160]   It's a site that never...
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.920]   Yeah, Inquisitor.com.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.800]   It's not an Apple rumor site.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.320]   It's more of a tech and celebrity gossip site/new site.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.200]   By Duncan Riley, who used to write for TechCrunch.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   Right.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.760]   So he has some reputation behind him in that whenever I see rumors coming out of the woodwork,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.560]   a lot of it depends on which site it comes from or which author it comes from.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.320]   Certainly an unknown blog posting a new rumor out of nowhere, you know, it gets a lot less
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.040]   credibility because anyone can set up a blog in five minutes and post whatever they want.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.120]   If there's a name behind it or some form of reputation behind it, I usually look a little
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   more seriously.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.560]   And then I think that's what helped get this $800 MacBook rumor off of the round.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   Because Duncan, people know it.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   Yeah, know him.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   Right.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.960]   Especially amongst the blog, blogosphere or whatever.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.440]   So everyone, I mean, everyone's once they saw it.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.120]   I think all of the non-Apple blogs were right.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   We're talking about it.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.200]   Well, Piper Jaffray also added some...
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   He fueled the fire by saying it's time that they do it.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   It would be...
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.920]   If we've heard a rumor, they'd say it would just be good business to do so.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   I guess.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.760]   It's always hard for me.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.600]   I'm never real happy about analyst reports.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.960]   I never really know what to do with them because they always say things like they know
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.600]   things, but you can't tell whether they actually heard it from someone who's in the know or
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.160]   they just said, "Well, this might be a good idea," or whether...
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.560]   A lot of times they come out with reports that seem to just recite sort of what's the
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.960]   circulating rumors.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   Right.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.520]   I mean, that's fine in terms of...
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.280]   Their audience is the financial people that they're writing their reports for.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.520]   So they may want to know what all the circulating rumors are at the time.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.320]   But from our standpoint, if we hear back sort of what everyone else has already been saying,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   you can't...
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   Is it confirmation?
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.080]   Is it just sort of the same that we've already heard?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.160]   So I can't do much with them.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.240]   But they were definitely one of the early ones to say that Apple's going to be dropping
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.040]   prices on their Macbooks.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.920]   And then it sort of gained momentum from there.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.680]   And that probably paved the way for the $800 rumor because that came out much later.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.280]   Everyone was like, "Oh, if the American...
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.320]   It's going to be $800, not $900."
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.240]   Who else got it wrong?
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.960]   Well, those were...
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   So I would...
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.880]   Those were probably the biggest or the most prominent ones.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.800]   The Inquisitor and the analyst report saying that there was going to be a $900 MacBook
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   Pro.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.240]   There was a few other sort of straggler rumors that were around nothing that gained a lot
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   of facts.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   That was...
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.640]   Well, I didn't hear that report.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.840]   We certainly did.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   And we talked about it.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.680]   He said there'll be Blu-ray drives in them.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   I think...
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.280]   Did you actually hear him say it on the actual podcast?
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   On Ignatian, no.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.400]   But we have close enough relationship with Kevin that I hear it from everybody who heard
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   Kevin.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   Why, you think he didn't say that?
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.040]   Well, I never got a chance to watch it.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   But...
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   I think he said it.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.360]   There was a site that reported on the live report before the podcast went up and said,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.080]   "Oh, Kevin Rose says that Blu-ray drives are coming in MacBooks."
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   And then I later heard from a couple of people that, "Oh, Rose said that this was his,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.280]   quote-unquote, "bad source."
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280]   So what...
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   I'm not sure how much you...
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.960]   Yeah, he did qualify it that way, yes.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.680]   So you know, I mean, to be fair, you know, Kevin Rose has had sort of ups and downs in
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   the rumors stuff.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.240]   I think he's a little more cautious than he had been...
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.800]   He was so right on with the...
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.400]   With the last refresh on the Nano that I think people give him a lot of credit.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.040]   Yeah, and he deserves credit for that.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.440]   Well, he's on the pipeline for this stuff.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   He did not blog about it.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.320]   So to his credit there, he did not...
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   It was only on Dignation.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.400]   But I think Scott and Alex, I think we poo-poot it at the time.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   Well, I tend to look at most of these rumors with a certain amount of skepticism only because
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.040]   I know that Apple does a fair amount of seeding of false rumors.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.760]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.320]   Yeah, they seed false rumors in there.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.520]   And I know that's one of the ways that they search out employees who are in violation
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   of the NDA.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Right.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.680]   Like, let's give Joe Bob over there this rumor.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.560]   And if he's the only one that we're going to tell this to and if it gets out, well, no
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   Joe Bob did it.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.440]   I mean, there's some stuff like that.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.280]   I think that, you know, what's interesting is that this is actually part of Apple's PR
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.280]   strategy.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.080]   They need, you know, our guests' rumor site.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.880]   If they didn't want them, they would simply put them to bed by putting out press releases
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.480]   like everybody else does announcing what they're going to do.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   Right.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.280]   I think it is.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:31.720]   I think the problem, of course, or the challenge really gets into the issue of if the hype gets
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.440]   too big, you know, a lot of times people can feel disappointed, you know, if we're expecting
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:43.680]   to see an $899 or $799 laptop and we don't get it, you know, then the announcements have
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.960]   less impact.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:55.920]   Now, Jason Calicanis also said pretty definitively that there would be an Apple TV with an HDTV
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.560]   with an LCD TV with an Apple TV like capability didn't come true.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.520]   But I don't think Jason said necessarily that would be the announcement this time around.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   You think it's still credible, Arnold?
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   It's possible.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.120]   There's been talk about an Apple television for a while and I don't know how much it makes
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.600]   sense though, I guess.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.680]   Does this Apple really want to get into a television or business for them, isn't it?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   Right.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   I guess anything is possible.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.960]   It's certainly been talked about enough.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.560]   But right, Calicanis didn't say, oh, it's coming next week.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   I'll tell you what, a 24-inch cinema display and an Apple TV is about as close to a television
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.920]   as most people need to get.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   What a great combination.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   You know, I like that news display.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.120]   Does that have HDMI?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   Scott on the new display?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   I don't know.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.760]   I've ordered it, but they're not shipping yet.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.560]   So it's about a month until I get mine.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.480]   I don't know if it has an HDMI port and I know it and I do know that it has some sort of
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.280]   new fangled connector yet another connector to buy.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.200]   But I kind of don't.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.600]   I keep on feeling like the one thing that I'm surprised at is that we don't just see
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.880]   everybody just, I guess it's probably some kind of royalty issue.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.680]   But I just really want to see my Max just show up with HDMI connectors, you know, and
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.200]   the monitors and let's just move past this VGA, DVI.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.640]   I don't mind display port.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.480]   The problem is that no TV is supported.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.440]   It's really kind of more of a computer standard.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   So you'll get a cable.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.560]   You'll like the DVI one.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.560]   You can get a DVI to HDMI cable.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.680]   So now you'll have a display port to HDMI cable that you'll buy separately.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.840]   It's just that it would be nice just people who buy HDMI cables and just, you know, and
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.920]   standardize it with like everything else, you know.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.240]   You talk a little bit of a near article Arnold about how to, what's a good way to vet these
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   rumors going forward?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.880]   What kinds of things should you look for?
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.440]   Well, I mean, I think, like I said, a lot of you.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.160]   You look for, I should say, you didn't get stung, for instance, by the Steve Jobs Heart
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.360]   Attack story that CNN put on his eye report.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.760]   You were quick to turn it down.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   Right.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.280]   You know, I mean, obviously the magnitude of the rumor sort of requires more or less
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.280]   betting.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.400]   You know, someone tells me that the new MacBooks are going to, you know, be 100 megahertz faster
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   than the old.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   It's, you know, who cares?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.880]   No one's, it's not going to have any impact, you know, or if there's like a new mouse color,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.480]   you know, some minor rumor.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.440]   You know, obviously the impact of that's less if you, you know, if you choose to report
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.480]   it or not report it, that's no one's going to care in the long way.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.400]   You may be right or wrong, but you know, it's not going to drop out while stock, you know.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.320]   Steve Jobs having a heart attack and being in the, in the hospital is a pretty major
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   rumor.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.680]   I would have required a lot of confirmation on that before running with it.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.600]   And the other issues, at least I have the benefit of when someone anonymous submits to
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.880]   the side, I know sort of what IP address it came from, and then sort of the story that
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.120]   rumor came from an proxy anonymous proxy IP address that also had been used to spam
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.760]   the forms in the past.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.440]   So I didn't put much credibility into it.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:57.760]   Then I saw that it was being promoted on 4chan as like a, you know, let's get, let's
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   yeah, right.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.960]   Let's, let's, you know, mess with everyone and promote this on dig.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.920]   So at that point, it's pretty much just a lot of credibility.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.320]   So, and then, but beyond that, for the other rumors, you know, like I said in the article
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.120]   is basically, I mean, if, if it comes from another site, you basically have to use that
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.000]   site's reputation as a, you know, as proxy for their sources.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.120]   So you know, some sites are a little more vigorous about their sources and will, you
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.760]   know, care about the reputation.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.880]   Apple insiders does a really good job with it.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.560]   You know, if they say something, it's usually true.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.440]   And you know, no one's 100%.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.880]   But I have confidence that they're not making stuff up just to get traffic sites that don't
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.800]   normally do Apple rumors.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.360]   Inquisitor being one of them.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.200]   And you just got to be on, you know, a little more uncertain because you don't know if they
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.240]   know what they're talking about, if they actually have sources or if they're being duped, like
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.560]   the heart attack story, because it's, for whatever reason, Apple rumors attracts a lot
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.440]   of people who try to try to trick people or try to take people out.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.680]   So I thought it was really surprising how accurate John Gruber turned out to be.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.480]   Not traditionally a source of Macintosh rumors, although certainly a very respected Apple
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   commentator.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   He got it right on.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.640]   He got the date.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.040]   He described the new laptops in great detail.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.760]   He obviously had a source somewhere.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.880]   I think Gruber is well connected in that he certainly has contacts in or around Apple.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.760]   I think he's usually a little more reserved about what he's willing to say publicly, you
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.640]   know, whether that's his own choice or his contacts prefer him not to.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.720]   But he's the one he nailed the date well-headed of advanced, well in advance of the date of
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.200]   the October 14th date.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.240]   He didn't, and then he pretty much detailed everything that was coming out.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.040]   Though that was right at the night before the event.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.280]   So I mean, at that point, the image.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.520]   Everybody had the pictures by then.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.040]   Yeah, a lot of stuff had already come out.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.600]   But I mean, that being said, he knew stuff that was clearly from, and that being said,
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.640]   Apple certainly lets more people know the closer it gets to the event.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.400]   So it looks like the real leaks are the manufacturers in China and Taiwan right now.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.920]   This is where they seem to be coming out of.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.440]   Yeah, that's where the big stuff came out this time.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.760]   And it's always a little hard to tell with internet photos because they never come from
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   the same source.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.880]   So you can't be like, well, these are definitely, this is definitely coming from someone who
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   knows.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.840]   Yeah, there was that one site, Apple.pro, which seems to be a Taiwanese site that had images
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:36.520]   back in July, which turned out to be accurate for the MacBook Pro exterior enclosure.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.120]   But yeah, then they had some other images that were not right.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.840]   So it's always a mixed bag.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.640]   But definitely, I think Chinese slash Taiwanese web forms and whatnot tend to be a major source
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.800]   because obviously these machines have to be manufactured somewhere.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.520]   And as you approach the ship date, someone in China is looking at these things running
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   off the assembly line.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.200]   So they're going to someone might snag one or take a picture.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.280]   How do you vet pictures when you look at pictures?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.400]   It's hard to vet pictures.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.200]   I mean, most, I mean, honestly, rule of thumb is if it's an internet picture is probably
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   fake.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.640]   If you go by that, you're pretty much almost always right.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:21.680]   But certain things like these, some of them are too perfect.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.400]   There are a lot of ad copies, images that look like they're supposed to be the new Mac
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.280]   ad cop, your ad images, ad website images.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.800]   And those actually have never been true.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   I don't know.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   They've always fake.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   In fact, they're so badly done.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.400]   They never use the right font.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.200]   They're poorly grammatically errors.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.760]   I mean, they're obvious almost all the time.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.080]   All your facts are belong to us.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   Right.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.320]   So it seems clear that Apple's ad team or website design.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   They're not leaking.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   They're not leaking.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.480]   I would ignore those.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.400]   They haven't had any turnover there in a while.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.640]   So that's how you know they're not.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.000]   I want to ask a quick question.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   What what what what duty do you feel to report rumors in terms of, okay, do you report all
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   rumors or do you and say, okay, I really don't believe this one.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.040]   But here it is, or do you only try to report the ones that you think have merit?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.600]   Well, I will for the ones that I feel like have merit come from major sites, major sources.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.360]   I'll report those, of course, and happy to report those and certainly give credit to sites
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.280]   that do reliably provide information.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.240]   Like, I mean, nine to five Mac is a relative newcomer to the whole Mac Apple rumor web,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.240]   whatnot.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.200]   But they clearly have some sources that are that are real.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.800]   So I'll be happy to post rumors by them with, you know, with that, you know, for whatever
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   reason.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.080]   The the other rumors that a lot of it depends on where they're coming from and how much
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.400]   exposure they've gotten already.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.560]   Certainly the $800 Mac book rumor, I wasn't real happy about because there were some other
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.000]   issues because it came from, you know, a site that hadn't really been a rumor site before
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.600]   and also had some issues about like that some factual errors in it, like that Apple sends
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.960]   their retailers, priceless 10 days in advance, which is not really true.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.920]   But once again, but you know, I'm not the only site out there.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.200]   So certainly the stories can gain traction without my involvement.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.720]   You know, certainly the end gadget and Gizmodo both have very large readerships and they
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   may post things that that come out that are less credible.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.600]   Now, I'll probably I'll usually if something gains enough traction, I'll post about it
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:36.480]   with some doubts or some, you know, you know, some qualifications depending on on what some
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.160]   what the particular rumor is.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.480]   And then for stuff that comes in anonymously, just like random tips, it that that that that
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.440]   I require a little more fact checking or a little more verification because then I'm
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.520]   putting my name on it and saying, well, this is what I've heard.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.560]   You know, I don't I don't want to put you know, I want to I want to keep some credibility
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.440]   to the site if I if I hear something, I just want to be pretty sure about it before I post
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   it.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.000]   Well, Arnold, we really appreciate your joining us.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I love Mac Rovers.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.040]   We steal from you religiously.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.160]   So I think every once in a while we should really put you on the show.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.280]   Give you some credit.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:18.040]   If you want to know what's going on, MacRumers.com just one last question.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.600]   And Arne just posted a story saying the Mac mini may be dead.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.280]   I wasn't Apple TV kind of then we'd write the obituary for Apple TV a few months ago
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.840]   to do you think a new mini maybe new iMacs anytime soon?
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.400]   The the Mac mini rumor.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   I mean, it's a new rumor today, but it's been talked about Mac mini being just it's do.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.680]   It's the one thing that's really do.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.400]   Yeah, I mean, they've been talking about I mean, but there've been rumors saying that
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.760]   it's going away for over a year now.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   And then there was another rumor saying, Oh, no, it's coming back.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   I mean, clearly, Apple's neglecting that that model regardless.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.080]   So I don't know what to make of it with this most recent report from Gizmodo in that I
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.280]   trust Gizmodo that they've heard that that this is a case that these European retailers
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.080]   are saying you don't expect any more Mac minis.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.240]   But you know, it's been heard before.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.880]   So it's hard to hard to say for sure.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.360]   I don't know if the Apple TVs really at risk of the same fate because I think Apple's
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   jobs have said Apple TV sort of a hobby.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.520]   So I think they can let that go for a while, even if it doesn't take off.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   Right.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   And how about the IMAX?
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.520]   Do you think we'll see new IMAX before the end of the.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520]   That's what they say.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   That's what Apple insider said.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   And it seems.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   They're pretty reliable.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   Seems like they were on on point before.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520]   So although it's surprised to me, it sounds like it'll be a minor update though.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.960]   I mean, it's only been it's it hasn't been that long since they've been updated.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.320]   The kind of adopt the cases are going to get changed.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.240]   It may just be sort of a minor bump.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.680]   Speed bump, yeah.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.200]   Maybe they'll include the Nvidia chips that may.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   That would be a good thing.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.400]   They really ought to do that.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.400]   Right.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   Display port mini display port and sort of consolidate the lines.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.200]   Arnold Kim, thank you so much for joining us MacRumors.com.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   That's the place to go.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Thank you.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   Take care.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   Okay.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200]   And with that, we bring in Andy and Otko.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   Sorry.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.520]   Yeah, I'm sorry to have been a jerk about that.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.280]   But I mean, Kim and I, we have.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.600]   Well, there's some issues.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.120]   If I were a bigger man, we could share the stage, but I'm I'm I'm hoping they all in
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.800]   branch has been held out.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.120]   It's his to take or spit on like he did the let what people are going to believe this
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   when you stop it.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.600]   Well, he does a rumor site so we can start new room.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.200]   Andy, I guess you're having trouble with the Skype, but we're glad we could get you
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   on.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.560]   No, I'm having trouble with damn Skype.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.880]   But I unfortunately, I need to pay the extra eight dollars for the version of Skype that
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   actually works.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   The free damn version.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.520]   Oh, well, you all are using that same thing.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.320]   The damn version.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.440]   So did you get the new Mac book pro?
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.960]   Mine is on its way or rather apples is on its way.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.680]   I get to play with it for a while.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.760]   I'm I'm interested in seeing, you know, basically do I got a whole mess of benchmarks ready to
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   go.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.960]   I've got aperture all ready to go.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   I've got video editing already to go.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.280]   I just want to see that it fits ready to play.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.720]   I can bet you that the certain Scott born is already tried aperture with it.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.520]   You notice the difference in speed, Scott?
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.960]   I do.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.280]   And it's it's one of those things where, you know, I don't have any fancy test equipment.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   So I get the old fashioned stopwatch I've had since I ran high school track, which is
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   about 112 years ago.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.480]   And I mean, in fact, the thing is so old that I had to shake the cobwebs off it.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.160]   But you know, I timed a couple of operations and aperture that I know would take a long
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   time.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.040]   Apple is claiming 49% faster performance.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:43.080]   And I can say that, you know, based on my stopwatch test, I got 40% faster performance.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.880]   And whether it's 40 or 49, that's enough for me to justify it.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.200]   I tell you, I've noticed a huge difference just empirically.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.840]   I haven't stopped watching anything, but a big difference in performance overall.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   One thing that kind of so I bought one and you bought one.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.320]   I know and we bought you bought a MacBook Pro.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.800]   I did about the pro, the 15 inch pro.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.400]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   And I'm starting to hear a lot of pain out of the ether sphere or whatever you call it
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.520]   over this.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.720]   The lack of a firewire port on the MacBook is a deal killer for a lot of us.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.040]   Yeah, I couldn't even consider it because I've got these 7200 drives that are looking
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.280]   for, you know, firewire.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.920]   I've got the Drobo that's looking for firewire.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.640]   It's just, you know, I, well, I have video cameras that I have to use firewire.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   And I think we talked about this last week.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.360]   We decided that we think we think they did it because they needed something.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.960]   They didn't need something to differentiate the two models.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.760]   I'm not sure that was a good enough reason.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.440]   Well, I think that there is a belief that that firewire is on the way out and that, you
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.480]   know, USB is going to become the standard.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.000]   And I think they're making decisions about what's available.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.360]   And the average person I have to admit, a person not doing video.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.880]   I think, you know, my wife has a has firewire.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.040]   She'll probably never use it on her laptop.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.520]   You know, she's got a MacBook Pro or whatever.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.200]   And she's, but she's not going to use the 800 or the 400.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.960]   She's going to, you know, end up using just USB.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   Everything.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.600]   So I think that, uh, I think that might be, you know, the, the average person doesn't
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   need it.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.440]   And it's an extra cost, you know, by a couple of dollars per per laptop, which, you know,
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.400]   inflates as it moves through the chain.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.640]   Two dollars though.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   Come on.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.960]   Well, two dollars, you know, two dollars gets doubled a couple of times on the way
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   through.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.840]   So it, you know, and if you're trying to cut another hundred dollars out, it does make
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   a difference.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.120]   I got an email from, uh, my good friend Derek came Miller, uh, who does the Inside Home
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.920]   recording, uh, podcast.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.560]   And he brought up another group of people who are pretty upset, recording people.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:39.880]   Uh, you know, we, we agreed that lack of target disc mode, big deal, um, camcorder support,
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.160]   big deal.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.960]   Um, but he says people like Alex, uh, you know, would never have found the MacBooks
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.160]   adequate anyway.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.080]   He said, but a lot of home recording people who don't have big budgets were using the
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   MacBook.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   Very happy.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.800]   Um, and, and you need the fire wire, uh, for a lot of
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   reasons.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.160]   He also points out that the Nvidia chipsets historically have problems with pro tools.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   So does the, does the math, everything has a problem?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   Everything has problems.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   That does so much.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.240]   Pro tools, the motto is, but pro tools motto is we're not happy till you're not happy.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   I gave it a long time ago.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.560]   Does the MacBook have, uh, an express card slot?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   It does not.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.640]   And so you can't add just no way to do it.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   No, I know.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   I can't think of any way.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   Is there a way?
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   Mm.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   You could do it over ethernet maybe.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   I don't know.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   Would you think of it more as like a super, more, more lower cost MacBook Air in terms
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.800]   of features in terms of power?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.040]   I mean, it's going to, it's going to be faster.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.720]   It's going to certainly be more, more muscular.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.960]   I mean, but I use a MacBook as my standard day to day machine chiefly because I do have
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.640]   a bunch of legacy fire wire drives.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.240]   I can plug in there where I want to use them.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   Right.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.320]   But then, but then again, I mean, how, how far away is the cost of a MacBook pro?
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   If you call yourself a professional and you wouldn't you want the extra performance?
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   It's far away.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.280]   Uh, it's 500 bucks, right?
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   At least.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.840]   I ended up spending, you know, when you, when you, when you all said and done with tax and
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.320]   everything is almost $3,000 for the high end, uh, MacBook pro.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   That's a lot.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.720]   That's a lot of money for a laptop, especially these days when you've got the most Apple
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.920]   ram you've ever purchased.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   That's right.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.680]   And I, you know, another thing I noticed is they don't go beyond four gigs, which I think
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.920]   nowadays is a little bit, uh, a mistake.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.400]   I was disappointed that I wasn't, you know, I was thinking we might get to eight gigs of
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.560]   ram or something like that or six.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.400]   I, uh, I'm glad it does have four because you really need four on high end.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.560]   That's how it should come.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.360]   I really want to, I want to quickly jump in on the screen here because I've got about
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.440]   2000 tweets from people saying how's the screen and, and I got to say, I absolutely
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   love it.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   I know Alex disagrees with me on using it for photography, but here's the reason it's
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.840]   not a problem for me.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.920]   First of all, even though I own a bunch of Apple 30 inch cinemas plays are sitting in
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:56.160]   a box because my 24 inch iMac is the perfect screen size for me personally with my eyes
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   to do photography.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.760]   Now that's a glossy screen.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:04.000]   The way I solve the problem is my studio is set up with a child's night light that resides
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.040]   strictly behind the screen when I'm editing photos.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.040]   That's the only light in the room.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:13.400]   I got no reflections and, you know, the MacBook Pro is not going to be the machine I do my
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   critical editing on.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.360]   I will use it in the field to evaluate photos and decide which ones I'm going to keep and
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.960]   put into a project in aperture, but I'm not going to be doing any critical editing on
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   it.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.840]   And you can tilt it around or put it in a situation where the light, you know, the reflection
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.160]   is not a big deal.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.920]   I will say the plus size is the color gamut on this thing is beautiful.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.640]   And if you calibrate it, you know, my first test show a pretty nice print coming off of
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.800]   an Epson 3800 tied to the MacBook Pro and I've only had time to do one, but it looked
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   really good.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.960]   Do you, is there any published numbers about how much of the gamut the display supports?
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.280]   I don't have any published numbers, but I can tell you just, you know, that's the one
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.280]   thing.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.480]   I see it, my photographer's eye spots that kind of stuff right away without any eat for
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   charts.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.240]   And it's definitely a wider color gamut and it may not be dramatic, but it's noticeable
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.760]   enough that I noticed it with my naked eye.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:12.600]   And more importantly, it was able in a profiled color, you know, matching system able to reproduce
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   it.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.800]   You're talking about just so people know, talking about the number of colors it can reproduce
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.680]   from say something like the Adobe RGB, the color profile.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.280]   And no, no monitor comes close to a hundred.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.560]   Yeah, basically what yeah, basically the problem for photographers is you hear this number one
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.880]   question probably when it comes to printing, why don't the pictures on my printer look
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.720]   like they do on my monitor?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.920]   And that's because the monitors are able to reproduce more vivid colors than the printers.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.960]   And through a system involving calibration where we calibrate devices and get profiles
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.000]   built on them, we can then have the software talk to itself.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.480]   So it says, okay, you see red this way.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   I see red this way.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Let's compromise and make that red so that you get what's called an accurate depiction.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.120]   Most people don't understand Leo, then photography, a color managed system does not guarantee,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.760]   does not guarantee an accurate photograph.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.280]   What it does guarantee is consistency.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   So if it's always two points red, too much to read, it's always going to be two points
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.160]   too much red in every picture.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.320]   And then you can adjust for it.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   That's when a true color managed system will give you at these price points because even
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.640]   though you can buy colorimeters that cost a thousand bucks, this is still considered
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:31.280]   consumer level, it's 80 to $100,000 to get up into the pro level stuff where you can get
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   accurate color.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.680]   I have to say the LED backlight clearly makes it not only brighter, but more consistent
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.000]   across the display and easier on your eyes, at least in my case.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   I just think it looks spectacular.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.560]   A lot of people don't like glossy, but I think the choice is either glossy or matte, which
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.440]   kind of to me, washes everything out.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.880]   I prefer the glossy.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.160]   Time for Alex to get in here and tell me why I'm wrong.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.120]   I just don't like, I don't like seeing reflections.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.000]   I mean, I've worked on, we have a couple of machines here that are really glossy.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.200]   I just don't like it.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.040]   I don't like seeing things moving around while I'm working.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:11.080]   So I mean, I'm going to get one, but I'm going to get the screen protector that is matte.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.120]   So is that how you would fix that?
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.440]   I Twitter that I was going to not buy one until I, it's why I didn't buy one the very
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   first day.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   I just didn't jump on it.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   I was like, oh, I got to figure this out.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.880]   And of course with me, then I don't get back around to it for a while.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.000]   But I was ready to pull the trigger.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.080]   And then I was like, I want to figure out where I'm going to find a matte covering.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:40.960]   And I was, you know, of course, replied to over and over and over again on Twitter and
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.000]   corrected that there are matte options now.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   So you take those on and off, Alex?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I think you can.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.680]   I think that I'm not sure if all of them, you go on and off.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.720]   I don't, you know, I don't think I'm going to care.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.560]   You know, I mean, I'm just going to put it on and leave it on.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.320]   I don't, I'm not, I just really don't like the glossy.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.200]   I've worked on a couple of machines with it and it hasn't worn my dislike for it has
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.760]   not worn off.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   So really?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.240]   No, no, I just, I just, I'm, as I said, I just don't like, I don't like, I really like
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.880]   not seen anything reflecting on like laptop or not very much.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   You know what?
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.280]   I spent a lot of time in the airport.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.760]   I don't, it's not like I can control it.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.200]   Like it wouldn't matter in this room that I'm in, but I'm in the airport.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   I'm in, you know, a lot of outdoor settings.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.960]   I'm in a lot of different locations and, and getting some, you know, getting much reflections
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.040]   from studio lights and all kinds of other stuff is just not something I'm very excited
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   about.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.440]   I respect your difference to the opinion.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.600]   There are actually human beings that, for instance, don't think Pamela Anderson looks
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.040]   good in a bikini.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   Okay.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.880]   Today or back when she was like, you know, before she was 40, either way, it'd be okay
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   with me.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   I'm so mad at her.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.960]   There was like an ad on one of the websites that said, come see a hot video by me.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.880]   And it was about Kentucky fried chicken.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.240]   Did you feel ripped off?
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.240]   Because I sure did.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.600]   As long as she's there, baby, I'm okay.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.400]   It was some Peter thing.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.880]   Now I've just, I mean, it really, I think it is going to be a matter of taste.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.680]   Alex puts forth a really good argument.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.160]   I mean, he's in a more mobile situation.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.480]   He's got to do more real editing on his computer than I do.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.040]   And in that case, I think it could be a concern, but it looks like it's another one of those
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.720]   things like the firewire decision.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.920]   Steve has decided we're going to go with the.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   I have to creed.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   Do they go?
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.160]   Can they can they, can they, if they go?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.720]   Is it tied to the LED or is it not related?
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   I don't know.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.120]   I mean, I understand if it were tied to the LED, because he really said we want to go mercury
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.920]   and arsenic free.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.760]   LED is certainly superior.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.240]   Does this mean those people will stop standing in front of the West Hall?
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.800]   We go into the green piece.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.640]   Yeah, Apple really has made a very concerted effort.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.520]   Did you notice on the, it's only on the new laptops.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.240]   They've replaced, you know, on the energy saver, it has a light bulb.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:01.680]   It's now an ink and it's now a fluorescent compact fluorescent on the new MacBook Pros.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   They've replaced it.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   Notice.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's not on any other other Macs.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.400]   It's only on the new Mac books and the MacBook Pros.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.920]   They have replaced the light bulb with a compact fluorescent for green.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.880]   It's even even the even the system preference pains are green now.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, baby.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.680]   Yeah, but it's powered by coal.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.840]   Clean coal.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.160]   I had a friend who no joke three days ago, slices head open on one of those compact fluorescent
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   bulbs.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.720]   So if you want to make me, if you want an argument from me that that the compact fluoresce is
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.120]   good for anybody, I got a photograph of a guy with six stitches in his head to say different.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.760]   What do you walk into it?
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.800]   Yeah, apparently the person who remodeled his basement one home an hour ago wasn't quite
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   so much a contractor, as much as up dudes cousin with a truck.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.520]   Well, anyway, let's take a break and we're going to come back talk more about these new
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   Mac books.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.560]   And there's a lot of stories, you know, of course never rains, but it pours.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.320]   There are a lot of things other things to talk about besides the new Mac books and what
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.560]   Apple might announce next year.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.440]   But we'll get including the Newton the annual Newton conference, which is which coming up.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.800]   But I know you're all going to want to go to.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.320]   But before we do, I want to mention our good friends at audible.com.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.280]   Audible is of course the place where you get audio entertainment of all kinds.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.320]   I used to say just books, but no, it's so much more than books.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.600]   Nowadays, audible audible has well, for instance, all the all the audio for free from the debates
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.760]   from the conventions, they do a lot of pro bono stuff during this election season.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.800]   They've got a whole election page.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.920]   They've got a lot of sci fi. They're doing a lot of recording nowadays on sci fi.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.200]   But you know, if you're in a books books is the place for audible is the place for books,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:57.180]   audio books of all stripes, 51,000 titles growing all the time.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:02.040]   You can listen to them on your iPod, your iPhone, burn them to CD, listen on your computer,
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:07.480]   even your GPS is if many GPS's could play back audible books.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.520]   So give it a listen, give it a try for a free audio book from audible.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.680]   Go to audible.com.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:20.760]   Audible.com/macbreak. Audible.com/macbreak. Andy, you have a recommendation this week?
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:26.600]   Yeah. There's a whole category of books that you tend to cheat yourself out of by virtue
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.680]   of the fact that you were forced to read them in high school.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.000]   And you hate them because it was homework.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.320]   Exactly. And you don't have enough time to do it.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.120]   And you just buy the Cliffs notes and again, part of you resent, you know, which just resents
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.400]   it. And most of them, unless they're written by Edith Wharton are actually really, really
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   good.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.440]   You're not a Wharton fan.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.040]   Oh, good God.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.080]   The first time that I intentionally punted an essay was when I had a write an essay on
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.800]   Ethan from and that was the first time in my academic career.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.280]   I said, I thought to myself, I know what the teacher wants to hear from me.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.040]   I know I can get an A by talking about this, that, and the other.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.480]   I just can't do it this time.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.240]   This is where I draw the line in the sand.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.960]   I got a D minus on it.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.480]   He offered me a chance to rewrite it and improve the grade.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.560]   And I said, no, I'll take the D minus on this paper.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.040]   I hated the book that much.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.560]   Good. So you.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.040]   I am not. Yeah, it was like, Oh, for God's sake.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   You know what?
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   If there's if there's a lack of passion in the relationship, why don't you just indicate
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.200]   there's a lack of passion?
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.000]   Don't color the candy dish red.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.480]   Ooh, it's color symmetry.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   Ooh, this is.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.920]   Oh, for God's sakes.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   Okay.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.080]   I'm I'm eliminating any eith Wharton now for my list.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   Exactly.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:43.360]   But what what okay, one of the great exceptions is F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.320]   This is a book that I didn't read really read for the first time at all, you know, until
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.560]   I was 10 years at a high school.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   And it is one of those books that I read at least once a year just because I'm sort of
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.600]   between books and I want something that's great.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.480]   And this one of those books I always come back to as a matter of fact, I was kind of
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.040]   stuck for something to read my trip to New York City.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.480]   I downloaded Gatsby for the iPhone intending just to sort of test out a reader.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.360]   And now I'm again, it's a great another reading.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.240]   And especially it's such lyric writing.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.440]   What happens in the book?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.240]   It's not one of these dramatic action-packed books where there's plot point by plot point
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.840]   by plot point.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.240]   It's just a book about an idea about an idea about where you are at a certain point in
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.800]   your life and your power to reinvent yourself and be whoever you want to be.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.720]   And it's not an, you know, not a Shyamalan story in which people actually morph into dark,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.160]   dark mirror versions of who they who they want to be.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.040]   It's just an immersive, immersive book, this sort of paper book where I'll finish reading
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.520]   a page and then reread it again immediately because I think that I didn't really appreciate
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.720]   every single comma.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.040]   It's also a book that really reads well allowed.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   I wish that there were more versions of Gatsby available on Audible because there is a version
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:08.640]   that a guy by the name of Anthony healed that apparently was must have been like the first
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.400]   one that like was popular.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.320]   And so anytime they need a Gatsby out of inventory, they take this version that was read God knows
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.720]   how long ago of the three or four different English versions that they have.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.520]   My favorite is Tim Robbins's version chiefly because the voice of a lot of versions.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.160]   Holy cow.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   I think Tim Robbins kind of matches the voice in my head.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:37.520]   It's a first person narrative of a guy that is sort of he's a war veteran and he's now
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.600]   studying to take up a new career.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.640]   I think Tim Robbins really sounds like that character in my head.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.360]   He doesn't sound like a book.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.960]   He doesn't sound like a book on tape now right here.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.200]   He sounds like an actor who's performing a role.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.800]   And also he apparently reads it a little bit more slowly than the other people.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.680]   So you get an extra free hours worth of content.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.200]   So if you're looking for bang for the buck by all means, let me play a little bit of
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.480]   Tim Robbins reading the great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   Special reference to the rather hard boiled painting that hangs in father's office.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.080]   I graduated from New Haven in 1915.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.280]   He does have that sound, doesn't he?
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.000]   And a little later I participated in.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.840]   He sounds like he did graduate from New Haven in 1997.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.960]   He sounds like that kind of guy.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   He's got it down.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.240]   It's kind of a little insutience, but yet still he's kind of not yet bitten by the rich.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.160]   He's a little bit like that, but young enough to get it slapped out of him.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.520]   Very good stuff.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.880]   I love it.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.080]   Yeah, the other, you know, this is a nice thing.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.560]   You can go to the Audible page and listen to the different readers before you decide,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.960]   which is probably a good idea.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.120]   Frank Mueller, who's also one of their best readers, does a version.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.760]   But some people don't like Frank's style.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.720]   He has kind of a...
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.640]   A little later I participated in that delayed, to tonic migration known as the Great War.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.120]   I enjoy the count of raid so thoroughly.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.160]   You kind of tell he has that same kind of...
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   He's doing the same thing, isn't he?
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   Again, it's interesting.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.320]   And this could turn to a half-hour about Gatsby, but I guess for your own taste, it depends
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:16.960]   on do you want to hear the younger voice of the person who is having this experience that's
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.000]   being outlined in the book, or do you want the older person who's remembering this experience
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   that he had?
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.520]   And for those of you in high school who would prefer not to read anything, you can still
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.560]   get the SparkNotes Guide for the Great Gatsby and A+AudiosteadyGuide on Audible.com.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.640]   So why listen to a four-hour book when you can listen to 24 minutes?
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.400]   My question is, why stick up just one middle finger at your teacher?
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.440]   When you can stick up both of them.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   I think I might have...
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   Other reading, though, Cliff Notes.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   The Spark Notes first.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   I listened.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:53.560]   I think I might have actually read "red books" for high school English if Audible had existed
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   back then.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.560]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.600]   I'm going to get my son into this.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.080]   A lot of reviewers, Audible told me a lot of reviewers do this because it's hard if you
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.840]   have to read a book and you have a time limit on this.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:11.160]   It's hard to sit down and do that, but kids have lots of time on their doing stuff.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.160]   Sit on the bus.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   Sit on the bus, skateboarding.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.640]   I could have done my English homework sitting on the bus.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.520]   Every time I think of Audible, I think of I could have been doing this on the bus.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.680]   I could have read it, I guess, but I only read about every third page.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   It's hard.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.400]   That gave me enough detail about the Cliff Notes.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.680]   I sunk in after that.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.400]   I agree with you, Andy.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.600]   What a great novel this is.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   I read it as an adult and appreciated it so much more.

[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.360]   So back we go to the topics at hand.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:58.880]   I will just for those of you who got all excited about the Big Newton Conference coming up.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   Yes, the next Newton Conference, the new dates have been announced for 2009.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.640]   That's going to be an S-star row, man.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.040]   It hasn't been 11 years already.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.080]   Oh, Newton, we hardly knew ye.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.120]   Let's have a special room where all the people that were here 10 years ago can meet.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.760]   Oh, it's just the closet.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.040]   Come on, there are a lot of new new new.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.120]   There's people put web servers on Newton's.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.760]   I have my Newton right here, my message is "bad 2000."
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.920]   I love it, but it's kind of the iPhone kind of killed it, I think.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   Did it really?
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   Well, pretty much.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   First, really, so nice.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   How many new?
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   That's a good question.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   I don't know.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.880]   People for July 31 through August 2, downtown Vancouver, there's a great website.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.640]   They're going to cover things like OS 10, Syncing, Wi-Fi, networking, reading e-books,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.920]   using the Einstein-Newton emulator.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:54.800]   For those of you who are unfortunate enough not to yet have your message pad 2000.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.400]   It's www NC 2009.com.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.320]   So now, Vancouver's got two things to look forward to, the Winter Olympics in 2010.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.320]   Yes, the worldwide Newton Conference in 2009.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   Now, this is really good news for all those women who are just dying to meet a neck beard.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.840]   You are mean.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.040]   You are mean.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.880]   So have you heard the new Apple ads?
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.480]   They're funny.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:26.920]   This is Apple's response to the Vista, you know, I'm a PC ad campaign, the $300 million
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:36.600]   that that worked, $300 million that Microsoft is going to spend to get people to use Newton.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:42.040]   Here's the get a Mac version of this with our good friend, John Hodgman and Justin.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.960]   I'm a PC advertising advertising advertising, fix Vista advertising advertising advertising
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   advertising.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   PC, fix Vista.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.920]   Oh, I'm just doing a little budgeting Mac.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.160]   You know, with all the Vista problems that have been frustrating PC users, I have to
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.720]   take drastic action by investing in advertising.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   Yes, advertising.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.960]   And I'm also putting something toward resolving Vista's problems.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.600]   Do you really think that amount of money is going to help fix Vista?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.760]   I guess you're right.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   I'll just put it all in advertising.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:17.860]   You know, somewhere I have this picture in my mind that Gates and Bomber are actually
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.720]   not running Microsoft.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:26.240]   It's really that dude that plays mini me in the bi-ag me movies, millions, millions
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   of dollars.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.080]   So, it's, yes, right.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.840]   So it's just, you know, I think he's really running Microsoft.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.160]   Apple is so good.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   Microsoft spent so much money and the sign fell to back.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.480]   And then the 300 million on these, on these new ads.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.360]   And Apple just gets a couple of guys, a table, a little visor, some money, a white background.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.560]   And they just boom, 30 seconds and it's over.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.560]   They just like a punch.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.960]   Because you can't, I mean, if you're Microsoft, you really can't run those ads anymore.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:01.920]   It's like, ah, ah, Microsoft would just spend that money giving their stuff away.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   They might have a better chance of getting some adopters.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.280]   Well, they're getting adopters.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.880]   Look at this is the, this, let's not forget that Windows.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.320]   I just don't think it was a joke.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:17.360]   Sold 200 million, or some number of Windows Vista users out there.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.320]   It's, it's a huge number.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.200]   But do you think any of them were sold on account of their ads?
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   No.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.520]   They're really, they have a problem because there is a widespread, a widespread, whether
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.320]   merited or not, but a widespread feeling that if there's something wrong with Vista.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.120]   There is something wrong with Vista.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.160]   Well, you don't like Windows.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.160]   That's what's wrong with it.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.360]   I mean, nobody's denying that it's Windows.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:45.400]   But, but I mean, I have to admit that I mean, when we get, we now have every computer that
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:51.080]   we, that we buy now, we're getting, we install Windows on, you know, we make it dual boot
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.240]   so that we can run a bunch.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   So every, every app.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   What's the thing you need Windows for?
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.280]   There's a program called Softimage or XSI, that's after Monash that we use.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.080]   And then there's some molecular modeling programs that we need.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.640]   That's a key.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.040]   They were for Kiki and now they're for a bunch of educational companies that are, that need,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   need that kind of stuff.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.000]   So we, so we need those applications and so we install Windows on every, on every computer
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.600]   that we have.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.520]   And, and we, you know, we don't even think about putting Vista on it.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.960]   I mean, we, we, everything's XP.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.440]   I, I don't have that problem.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.800]   I use Vista on a lot of machines and I like it a lot.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.960]   And in fact, if you listen to Windows weekly, I, I know Paul Thorett's going to blow his
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.640]   top over this Mac ad.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.720]   He just hates these Mac ads.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.920]   I mean, I'll also realize that the Windows world is now, there's, there's, there's just
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   so many different experiences.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.800]   The windows world, a lot of them are bad.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.720]   But if you have the right kind of setup, Vista is actually a very good, very stable
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.720]   operating system.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.160]   I use it on a machine that was designed for Vista.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.560]   I'm also not using legacy stuff.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.960]   Like I do stuff in my office that's like, you know, four, five, six, seven years old
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.200]   and worse, but I'm not using it with Vista.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:08.240]   I, I really do think that people who walk into Best Buy and walk out with a notebook
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.040]   are going to have a pretty good experience with Vista.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.240]   I, I think that a lot of what Apple saying is very, very true, but I'm not sure.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.160]   In this case, in this case, it's very, it's, I mean, look, it's a great.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.960]   Oh, but it's both completely both fixed problems with Vista.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   It's like, when did you stop beating your wife?
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.880]   It's a completely loaded, they, they're stipulating their problems, right?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.520]   It's like, you also got to say, I mean, three, I don't know how they let that number get
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.720]   out $300 million on an ad campaign.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.360]   It's that again, that's like saying that you're your bank manager, you know, just put
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.440]   on half a million dollar retreat or a ruba to talk about, you know, how well the ATM fees
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   are working on for everybody.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.640]   It's a big mistake.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:54.600]   But, and I just, I have to say, just from the max side, looking at the max side, that's
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.800]   just a knockout punch in 30 seconds that basically takes the whole campaign out.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.480]   It's like, they're the kings of judo.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.560]   They just know how to get the most impact with the minimal amount of effort, usually
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.000]   using your opponent's size and weight against them.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Very good.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Very apt.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:18.320]   Um, Apple will announce, of course, as always, planning its announcements to coincide with
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.480]   the production and per and release of this show at four o'clock this afternoon, Pacific
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.000]   time one o'clock, I guess four o'clock Eastern time one o'clock Pacific after the close of
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.120]   the markets, Apple will announce its quarterly results too late for this show.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   But I'm going to turn, I'm going to make lemonade.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   Here's our chance to predict with great accuracy.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.720]   What Apple's going to say this afternoon?
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.840]   I'll let Scott Boren start because he's the, he's the financial wizard among us.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.280]   I think they're going to show that they had a pretty decent quarter, but it's not going
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   to matter.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Staco Plumbit.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.920]   I mean, you know, there's already this.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.920]   I think today.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.720]   Yeah, it's not, it's not traditionally their best quarter in the cycle.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.400]   And, and you know, there's the whole markets crazy.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.400]   I could be wrong.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.920]   I don't think we're going to see terrible news in terms of output.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.280]   I think we probably won't see that for a couple of quarters yet.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.120]   I think it's going to take a while for that to reach, you know, those numbers.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:22.080]   Well, and they've already, I think started with the drum beat of lowering expectations
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.120]   so that they'll look good, right?
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.600]   And some of that is true.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.000]   And some of it's just because, you know, you can get sued for sneezing and somebody saying,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.840]   Oh, that sounded like a pretty positive indicator to me.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.000]   I bought stock based on that sneeze.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.080]   So they pretty much have to always say we're going to suck because if they don't, somebody's
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.120]   going to sue them.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.720]   I would be surprised if these numbers are terrible.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.000]   Let's put it like that.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.120]   But I also would be surprised if it matters because, you know, the stock is off like the
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   market is off.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.720]   And let's just take a look at the last 14 days.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.800]   It's been a wild ride.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.080]   You can't really count anything that's going on in this market.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.600]   Is anything remotely close to the norm?
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:03.560]   Currently $93 or down about 5% on the day.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.720]   Do you think they'll go down more?
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.600]   When the price when the news comes out?
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:12.360]   Almost always because, you know, whatever it is, the analyst expects it tends to be
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.840]   more than what Apple can do.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.000]   I don't think you worry about what it's going to look like on a given day.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.360]   You worry about what it's going to look like year to year.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.000]   And the stock is, you know, pretty low compared to where it was a couple of years ago, a year
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   ago.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.520]   So I think that there's a lot of people have been buying all sorts of stock because these
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   numbers are low compared to where we were.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   Yeah, bargain.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.840]   You know, it's the old adage.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   You know, a lot of people are selling right now.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.640]   Well, the best time to buy is now.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.600]   The best time to sell is when they're high.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   You buy when they're low and you sell when they're high.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.920]   Got an interesting anonymous email from somebody.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.600]   We were talking about this last week.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.720]   He says, arguably, Apple is one of the most loved stocks on Wall Street, maybe tied with
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.420]   Google.
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.240]   He said their earnings tonight along with Yahoo are coming out.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.680]   Both will be, quote, better than expected because, you know, that's a Wall Street misinformation
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   game.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:10.920]   The company forecasts or it kind of encourages certain forecasts, you know, above what or
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.840]   below rather what they know they're going to release.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.200]   And then of course they beat their expectations.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.760]   Although that happens enough.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.600]   That fails enough that I think there are also companies that are not able to manage that.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.600]   Maybe perhaps not as well as Apple.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.120]   He says his guess is the price will drop 20 to 30 percent in the near future because
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.460]   it's over owned.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:34.040]   He says people who own it are just in it because of the herd mentality, not based on an inherent
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   value.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.200]   I mentioned last week that they have a great cash position.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.400]   He says the book value is $20 per share.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.760]   So yes, they have some cash, but they also have liabilities.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   The tune of 10 billion.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.760]   I didn't know that.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:52.000]   Well, you know, when it comes to herd mentality accusations like that, the problem with people
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.920]   that make those predictions, they think that they can predict where the herds go because
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.440]   whether or not the herd is what's driving the buy doesn't matter.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.700]   It doesn't matter because people aren't going to get out of it because they're just part
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.700]   of the herd.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.860]   As long as the herds go on that way, they're going to keep going that way.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.860]   Right.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.620]   When the stock has been as high as 200 bucks a share and you're in it 92, you're thinking
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.220]   to yourself, I ain't going anywhere.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.220]   Feels pretty good.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.940]   I think you've got a lot of room to go back up.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.740]   And keep in mind also a lot of the employees and people that got in at 10 and 15 and 20,
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.700]   they're still in tall cotton.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.580]   That's a very important thing because that's how you attract employees.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.120]   You keep employees, keep the best employees as you give them stock options as long as
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.200]   they're doing all right.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   That's really cool.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   Let's just look at this.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.280]   Let's say that two years ago you were thinking about quitting because you're tired of long
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.080]   hours and you got enough stock at 10 bucks on your options that at 200 bucks, you're
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.520]   going to be a cazillionaire.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.280]   Then today, you decided not to.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.160]   And you thought, well, maybe I'll wait till 2008 and now your stock is worth half a cazillion
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.440]   bucks.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.280]   You're not going anywhere until it gets back to.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   No.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.760]   I want to go back to cazillion.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]   Those are official numbers.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.260]   How many zeros are behind a cazillion?
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   Cazillion.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.060]   I think there are 98 octillion zeros in a cazillion.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.060]   So I'm, I wait, just three.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.220]   Octillion is a real number.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.460]   Your theory is that like stock options are like what the company store used to be like
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.820]   for coal miners 130 years ago.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.820]   Okay.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.820]   Okay.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.820]   Oh, my soul do the company store.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.180]   I mean, really, think about it.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.540]   If you're, if you're in a 10, 12 bucks and you were seriously, look at that particular
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.540]   scenario.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.740]   Would, would you be in a rush to quit now knowing that it's perfect sense.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.900]   And with the, when the price is a little bit low, but has been hired also means those
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.180]   options that they give new employees are more attractive.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180]   At least psychologically.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.380]   I mean, it had sucked if you're the guy that's getting out today.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.900]   You know, and you got to go today, whatever.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.700]   Who came in six months ago.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   That's not good.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.700]   I guess it wouldn't best by then anyway.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:59.100]   A couple of weeks ago, we had General Motors stock at a 51 year low.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.380]   So the, the, the announce, I think the announce is going to be good for Apple.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.500]   I think they're going to have had a good quarter.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.860]   There, the rumors are they will have sold.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.020]   I think what was it 24?
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.700]   What was the number I saw?
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:17.580]   Probably an expectation being, being set by Apple, you know, surreptitiously, but, but
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.180]   of a lot of, let me see if I could find it.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.780]   I think iPod sales were 11 million units.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.780]   Something like that.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.180]   They're expecting, yeah, huge numbers on, on max sales too.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.780]   I think they're going to do well on laptops.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.300]   I think they're going to do well on the iPhone.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   I think they're going to do well.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.700]   Twenty five percent, twenty to five to twenty nine percent growth in the fourth quarter.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.020]   And I don't think that that's going to necessarily push the stock up right now.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.540]   Two point eight million max.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.620]   No, you're probably right.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.620]   You're probably right.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.520]   Although again, I think bargain hunters are going to look at it and remember what it was
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.300]   six months ago and say, hmm, well, soon as I could tell you what's going to happen.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   As soon as the credit markets loosen up and we saw a little bit of loosening just yesterday,
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.780]   but as soon as they loosen up, you're going to see, you know, people jump back in, not
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.300]   just on Apple, but everywhere.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.300]   Because right now the money sitting in T-bills that are paying point two four percent.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.420]   Scott, what do you think the effect is going to be in the long run over the next few months
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.060]   when people who got into the market or started buying these, these, these tech stocks, you
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.020]   know, to take profits, decide to take their profits and go?
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.220]   Do you think that's going to be like an artificial depression of value coming up?
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.020]   Is there another way to come?
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.780]   I think there's always a certain amount of profit taking in any of these stocks like
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780]   that.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.860]   And there are cycles for sure where there's, you know, people come in and they take profit,
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.940]   but people are way more sophisticated today than they were even 10, 15 years ago about
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940]   this stuff.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.340]   Andy, people come in and do like what I did a couple of weeks ago.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.420]   I bought, I bought general motors because it was at a 51 year low.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:49.620]   That day I made 30% on that investment, that day I took profit on half of that and left
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.940]   the rest right.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.140]   That's more of a typical strategy these days.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.860]   People aren't going to come and take all their profit because once again, we're right
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:57.140]   back to that issue.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.380]   Where do you put the money?
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.220]   There's just not a lot of places to put the money right now with T-bills paying, you know,
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.260]   like I say, nothing.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.700]   Lots of people's, you know, they're looking at their money market accounts.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.380]   They're only safe if they're tied to T-bills and what that really guarantees them is no
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.380]   growth.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:18.420]   I think that there is some concern about what you say, but I don't think it's a big problem.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.980]   And once again, Apple was a company that around a year ago was close to $200 a share.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.420]   People are going to look at that and say, that is the potential.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   That's real.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.780]   And when the market stabilizes, that's the number people eventually think we're going
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.660]   to hit.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.780]   Well maybe this will put it over the top.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.820]   Our good friend Merlin Mann is going to be very happy to hear that there finally is a
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.540]   Beatles iPod.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:47.260]   Announced here on Mac very quickly.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:57.420]   The US department store Bloomingdale's is announcing a $800, $800, Beatles themed iPod
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:04.060]   classic because along with the iPod, you get the collector's box set of the Beatles back
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.500]   catalog because of course you can't still can't buy the Beatles.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.300]   Sir Paul is going to have to hurry here.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.580]   He's only got a few more months till the end of 2008.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.860]   He said it would happen this year.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.980]   Sir Paul, you get a 120 gigabyte black iPod featuring a Beatles logo on the front.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.260]   I don't know how they did that.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.380]   The Abbey Road album cover on the back.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.820]   There are only 2,500 of them and four year 800 bucks.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.900]   Of course you also get, you've got to do your own ripping the box set of Beatles back
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   albums.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:37.420]   Now the anti-annocco version of this is you get a little Burger King sticker that's been
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:43.100]   transmogrified into a Beatles logo and he gives you the CD set that he bought at the
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.100]   used DVDs store.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.100]   There you go.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.100]   And that's only 400 bucks.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.100]   There you go.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.980]   That's actually a better idea.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   Again, I'm a freelance print journalist in the collapsing market.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:57.660]   For an extra $30, I'll rip the CDs for you and put them on the iPod.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.460]   By the way, I talked to Merlin today.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   He's traveling.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:05.620]   I asked him to come on the show to celebrate this victory, but he said he's out of town.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.620]   He will come back.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.620]   He's Merlin's decided to take a break from this show.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.700]   He's a very busy guy and he's really trying to, as always, triage all the stuff he has
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.700]   to do.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.140]   But he said from time to time, he'll come back and so he said, call me next week.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.540]   Maybe we'll get him on next week.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:25.340]   He could celebrate finally the vindication that he deserves about the Beatles iPod.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:28.740]   Don't send the Ringo to autograph.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.500]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.460]   Did you see that?
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.540]   Ringo said he's over the Beatles.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.540]   No more.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.900]   I'm not signing anymore after this month.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.900]   It's over.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   No more.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:39.900]   Don't send me crap on everyone.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.860]   Because you know, there's such a long line of Ringo.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.860]   Evidently there is.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.260]   Apparently it's overwhelming.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.260]   Apparently.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.700]   It's the Ringo nation.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.300]   Did we talk about on this show?
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.900]   Was this show we talked about?
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900]   Or was it another show?
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.780]   I was sort of thinking it was going to be around the same number of people attending
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.780]   the Newton Conference.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.740]   No, I think it was on that at night.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.100]   We played the video, Ringo posted a video on his blog.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.700]   Said, I'm not signing anymore.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.700]   Don't send me anymore.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.700]   I'm done.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.700]   I'm over the bay.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:12.380]   It was very, very, very sniffy and very, very perturbed.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.780]   He wasn't nice about it.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.660]   He doesn't have to sign autographs, of course.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:21.900]   But it was like, look, don't send me anymore because I won't be autographing them.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   It's like I'm done.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:29.420]   But you know, if you think about it for almost 50 years now, he's had to sign autographs.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.340]   He's probably, you know, look at his Ringo.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.540]   He probably gets hundreds of things a day.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.580]   I think that there must have been something that finally broke the camel's back.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.860]   So almost a sudden, like a human foot or something.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.860]   I think he just realized that for 35 years, he's been known for something he did 35 years
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:44.860]   ago.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:45.860]   Right.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.700]   Well, I could also be that, you know, today's so-called internet community has this expectation
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.860]   that you won't send it.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:57.020]   So I can see some kids sending him a letter saying you violated my constitutional rights
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.940]   when you refused to sign my CD.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.260]   I totally can see that.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.260]   I'm not with it.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.260]   Yeah, I can totally see that.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:08.540]   Now, I will contrast that with our friend Leo, who everywhere we go, patiently stands
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.460]   and signs autographs and takes pictures.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.460]   We've all learned from Leo.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.460]   You stay till the last person's there.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.020]   But one wonders if 50 years from now, Leo will host a similar video.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.100]   I'm not signing it anymore.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.700]   The screen savers has been over for 50 years.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:28.660]   You guys, I think you'll be more like Michael Jackson, where you have your press agent arrange
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.900]   for fans to tip off the fence.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.700]   You're going to be somewhere just so you have.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.100]   I've been doing that for years.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.500]   Please come see me.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.500]   Please.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.380]   You vultures away, away.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.660]   We couldn't even eat a couple years ago at Macworld, Leo.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:46.660]   And you were very gracious.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.620]   We got one pizza and you went for it.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.620]   You signed autographs.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:50.860]   Don't get that many requests.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.020]   It's not that hard to do.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.860]   Oh, you had 700 people in line.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.860]   Come on.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.460]   Hey, we're going to take a little break and get your picks.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.460]   I do one more stir.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.300]   I just want to throw in that Apple and SciStar, the company that was making those white box
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.260]   clones with OS 10 on them, I've agreed.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.300]   Well, they've agreed to go to an arbitrator.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:13.140]   Alternative dispute resolution, which is I think it's a good solution.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   And also for Apple, it is non-binding arbitration, by the way.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.340]   But it does give Apple a chance to keep it completely quiet.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:27.740]   And it also shows the requisite activity on Apple's part to protect its trademark.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.860]   Yeah, you know, in a way it says, look, guys, we have to do this.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.180]   Let's talk to the nice arbitrator.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:37.940]   We'll solve this and we can all go away happy.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.180]   And there'll be no press about it.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.420]   So I think that's a-- frankly, from SciStar's point of view, that's probably a good thing.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.380]   Remember, we did think that there might be some merit to SciStar's case and that perhaps
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.140]   it is a good idea for Apple to choose this room.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.780]   It sounds like what they'll end up doing is no matter what happens, SciStar will stop
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.180]   making mat-compatible computers.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:02.220]   And Apple will either win or pay them to not talk about it, but just stop making them.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.780]   So that's kind of killing it off one way or the other.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.780]   They're going to put them out of one way.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.380]   That's definitely-- that's something that really occurred to me when I-- when, you know,
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.060]   I think we all have the same reaction when we saw-- you first, you hear about it and then
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:19.060]   you go to the website expecting to see some sort of like real serious company effort.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.420]   And it looks like something that was done on like a .Mac account by two college students.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:28.460]   As you really have to wonder if the whole point was, we want Apple to get so annoyed
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.660]   by this they'll pay us not to make these things.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.460]   That's a reasonable business model.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.100]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.780]   Come back with your picks of the week in just a little bit.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:44.420]   But first, I want to mention a pick that's been a big pick for all of us for some time.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.180]   And I'm talking about the Drobo.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.420]   We love our Drobo.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.660]   I know you love your Drobo.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.340]   If you've got one, if you don't, why not?
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.460]   Let me tell you what Drobo is.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.660]   It's a big ass hard drive.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.140]   Four of them.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:01.300]   But it looks like one big USB or firewire drive.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.060]   You put four discs in there.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.540]   They add up to make a huge drive up to-- what is it?
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.540]   Six terabytes?
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.140]   I can't remember what the total Mac--
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.020]   Well, currently, currently it'll support--
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.020]   Sixteen.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.700]   Up to 16 when we have drives that big.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.380]   Right now, because the largest drives out there, I think, are 1.5 terabytes.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.460]   It would be six.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:24.220]   Now, some of that is reserved for redundancy.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.180]   And that's one of the things I like about the Drobo.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:31.100]   It's not just a big USB drive, because even if one of the drive dies, you just pop it
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.540]   out and you put in a new one.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540]   Very easy to do.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.540]   The front is magnetized.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:39.500]   In fact, the front even has-- and I love this for ease of use on the front guide as
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.300]   to what the lights mean.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.260]   When it's green, the Drobo, there are four lights on the front.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.580]   The Drobo is operating properly.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:52.740]   When it goes to orange, it means, oh, you're starting to run out of space.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.740]   This is the drive to replace.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.180]   It even tells you which drive to replace with a larger drive.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.420]   I've been doing this for some time.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.500]   As drives get bigger, you just put bigger drives in and the Drobo gets bigger.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.460]   I use it for backup all the time.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.460]   It is a miracle.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.940]   Now, there are two Drobo models out.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.780]   There's the-- I'm going to call it Drobo Classic, the USB 2 Drobo now at a reduced price,
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.940]   because the second generation Drobo is the Firewire 800 Drobo.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.140]   But it's good they have the USB now because people with MacBooks want to still use their
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.140]   Drobo.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.900]   Did you see the new announcement today from Drobo?
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   I did.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.900]   There's an API.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   An API.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.500]   And there's applications already out there.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.580]   So people are writing plugins.
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.340]   For instance, you could get iTunes server.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.180]   It really is turning it into more and more of a network attached storage device, which
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.020]   is running servers on the Drobo.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:42.540]   So if you've got your music on there, for instance, it can now be an iTunes server.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.740]   That is very cool.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:45.740]   We love the Drobo.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.420]   Tell you what, here's the deal.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:51.180]   You get all that performance, all that safety, the expandability, the ease of use, and you
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:54.180]   get 25 bucks off the Drobo of your choice.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.060]   You can either get Drobo Classic at a new reduced price of the second generation Drobo
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.260]   with Firewire.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:09.740]   25 dollars off when you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.380]   If you're not using a Drobo, you're missing out on the best thing your Mac could ever
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.380]   have.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:19.140]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.380]   I did.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.380]   You should too.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.380]   I love that.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.380]   That's Jeff Smith.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.460]   Everyone else might have just stopped buying sings.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.220]   He's great that way.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.420]   So it is time for our picks of the week.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.860]   Mr. Scott Borne, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.940]   Boy, do I have a good pick.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.020]   I mean to tell you.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.540]   If it's an aperture plug-in.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.700]   It is.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.740]   It's not really a plug-in.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:51.100]   What it is is, I don't know how this company pronounces its name, Joomisoft or Jumsoft,
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.460]   J-U-M-S-O-F-T, do you all know them?
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.460]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.900]   They make stuff for pages and keynote, all of which is great.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.740]   I shouldn't say the keynote is so great I haven't tried it, but I have tried to pay
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.740]   these stuff.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.740]   I have used their templates.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.740]   They are great.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.820]   They now have four aperture, new web themes.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.580]   So you can send, it's only 29 bucks.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:21.060]   You can download four aperture, a new set of gallery templates that are designed for photographers.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.420]   There's 11 new themes.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:29.220]   These aren't the most artsy, fartsy, dramatic themes, but what they are is very clean and
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.460]   professional.
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:34.300]   And they're designed to work with aperture 1.5 or higher.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:41.340]   There are several, but my favorite is one that is called Black Grid.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   Black Grid?
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:47.100]   Sorry, my facts just went off.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.420]   Somebody's sending you a note.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.980]   It's that exciting.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.220]   It could be from Apple corporate saying, "The yearnings are out."
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.220]   No, it won't be that one.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.820]   I don't get those calls anymore because I'm not a shareholder.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:05.020]   Anyway, they have one that looks like an iPhone, which is pretty cool.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:09.340]   They're just designed so that they'll come up in your aperture gallery automatically
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.860]   once you load them.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:17.220]   If you don't like the boring themes that aperture natively provides you, this is an alternative
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.580]   for under $30.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.860]   I found them very compelling and easy to use.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.540]   If you're a photographer and you use aperture, you might want to check them out.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.500]   That's j-u-m-s-o-f-t.com.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.740]   It's the top.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.220]   It's the top.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.220]   JoomSauptor.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.220]   JoomSauptor.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.660]   Very cool.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.380]   I got to get aperture and try it on the new MacBook.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   You think it's time maybe?
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.780]   Yeah, I think it might be time.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.300]   2.12, by the way, we didn't announce.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.820]   Just, yeah, it just came out, yeah.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.300]   2.12 came out yesterday.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.300]   It's an auto update.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.940]   If you've already got aperture, the software update will do it on your computer.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.300]   Any big changes in it?
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.500]   No, it does two things.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.020]   It just does a little bit to the raw converter.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:00.380]   Mostly what it does is it helps the internal printing stuff that you get from Apple.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:06.620]   When you send in for a print, a card, something like that, it just makes it better.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.780]   Does it at a higher resolution, I believe?
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:14.860]   Hey, has anybody released the raw interpreters for the LX3 yet?
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:18.140]   There is one out there, but I haven't tested it.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:23.860]   In terms of major companies like Apple and Adobe, the answer is no, not yet.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.060]   Very frustrating because I can't use Lightroom.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:31.220]   Yeah, since it's always frustrating when you get a new camera because it seems like these
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:37.060]   days, every single camera manufacturer, no matter who makes it, gets out ahead of the
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.060]   companies like Adobe.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.700]   Do you use DNG, you know?
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:47.340]   Well, Adobe actually releases that to the people to make it a true open standard.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.620]   I think you'll see more of that.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.620]   They do plan to do that.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.980]   I do have one camera.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:58.380]   The Pentex Digital SLR writes DNG format, which I think is great.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.180]   It just makes it so much easier.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.460]   So it's not really a spec yet, so they can't do it.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:12.580]   Yeah, it really is going to be though, I believe, because we did have on-twhip, a guy
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:17.260]   from Adobe Tom came in and talked about DNG and he talked about them really finally letting
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:22.420]   it go to the O source community so that it could actually be truly a standard that everybody
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.620]   could get involved with and not just be controlled by Adobe.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.300]   And I think once that happens, you'll see camera manufacturers embrace it.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:33.620]   The LX3 is just like the D700 was when I got it.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.580]   It's just like the D3 was when it came out.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.860]   It's just like the 5D Mark II will be when it comes out.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:43.620]   That is, you will have to wait for either aperture, Lightroom, or Photoshop to create
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.260]   a rock converter for it, and that's just the way it goes.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.420]   I loved the LX3, I gave it to my wife because I'm in trial.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   She's still shooting film.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.780]   And she's had, no, she's had several digital cameras, but she keeps going back to her
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.780]   OM1.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:01.060]   And so I gave her the Lumix, this is the new Panasonic, the Lumix LX3.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.380]   She fell in love.
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.260]   She's already written her phone number on it.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.260]   She fell in love.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.260]   She said this best camera ever.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.020]   I think she did that one back.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.020]   I know.
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:13.060]   I'm a little sad because I loved it, but on the other hand, I'm very happy because she's
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.380]   finally shooting digital.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.740]   She's a very good star.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.420]   I should be getting the external viewfinder for it today.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:24.060]   Yeah, I wondered if I should get that for her because she's used to that, but she actually,
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:28.620]   in a really sunny day, it's kind of tough to just use the back.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.700]   She's getting used to the back though.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.660]   She likes the idea of being able to see that picture a little bit more clearly.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.060]   Did she turn on the grid lines?
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.820]   No, she's not that.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.540]   She does it intuitively.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.540]   Okay.
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.740]   She knows she's got very good eye for composition.
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:41.940]   I don't think she knows what she's doing.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.020]   I mean, she's not thinking in the rule of thirds or anything, but she just does it.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.020]   She's very good.
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.740]   It's good just to keep your horizon straight though.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.740]   Be good for that, huh?
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.740]   I can never get my horizon straight.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:55.380]   Is that with a camera or in life in general?
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.380]   In life.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.380]   Look at this.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:02.980]   If you look at the shot right now on the on the on the Twit Live, it's a little crooked.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.100]   Everything I do is a little crooked.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.180]   My life is usually tilted to the right just a little bit.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180]   That's your politics, dude.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.260]   I'm putting a free meeting I had with my high school guidance counselor coming right
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.780]   back to me right now.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.780]   You're tilted.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.700]   Annie and I go your pick of the week.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:24.860]   My pick of the week is a version 2.0 of something that I kind of missed out on version 1.0 of
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:31.780]   file makers bento to you almost don't want to call it a database program because over
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:36.300]   the years databases have been the only major productivity app of the last 20 years that
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:43.540]   seem to have missed the entire revolution where graphics programs even spreadsheets,
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:47.980]   work processors, everything, stopping something you needed special training and even special
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.260]   language in order to understand how they work.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:54.060]   They just became applications you just mess around with and work to whatever you wanted
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.300]   them to do.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.700]   Bento is the first database where you don't need to know about tables.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.260]   You don't need to know about relations.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:04.220]   You don't need to know about, you know, a forms mode or a label mode or any sort of
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.540]   mode whatsoever.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:10.420]   It's just a box you can dump data into.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:16.900]   What I love the most about it is that you can use this to build just about any data centric
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.060]   solution that you want.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:25.700]   If you are, if I'm not a person who has found a really good personal organizer or task manager
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:30.900]   app yet, it is very, very easy for me to create my own task management app into it.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.940]   For instance, one thing I don't like about the ones that are commercial out there is
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:41.700]   that my mailbox, my Apple mail account is pretty much where I get most of my input and
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.380]   output from when it comes to where do I meet this guy?
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.500]   Hey, what's the phone number of this person here?
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.700]   When I enter the building, do I have to sign in the front desk or go here?
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:56.500]   Bento will allow me to not only create a project file, projects for each, excuse me, database
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.940]   to manage all these projects, but it will also integrate easily with mail so that as
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.740]   soon as I get an email that's related to this book project, I can just send it right to
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.300]   my Bento organizer.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:10.740]   Now it's a live, easy email that I can then either send replies to, refer to from as data
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.460]   or do whatever I want with.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:17.140]   What's amazing is that it's also really super tightly integrated with everything else that's
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.980]   going on in the Mac.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.060]   The address book that's built in with the OS is pretty full-featured, but it's not really
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:30.260]   a professional heavy-duty, ninja-level contact manager.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:35.860]   With Bento, you can simply drag in the address book library and essentially build an address
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:42.540]   book plus that will actually have, it contains all the data that is contained within your
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.700]   current address book, but it's not an import.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:49.340]   It's actually using that live database and that it can add, your own Bento library will
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:54.340]   have other information that adds to it and supplements it and adds photos and adds maps
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.580]   and lets you bring up live chats.
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:00.820]   The idea is that if you never use the address book application again and just keep updating
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:05.540]   your contacts within this little Bento project that you created, when it comes time to do
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:11.020]   a sync with your iPhone or to .Mac, well, you've been updating without your knowing it,
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.780]   your original address book database.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:20.140]   It gave you a really huge amount of power at very, very low contact, but you shouldn't
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:25.860]   get away from the basic idea that if you have any tasks that involves getting lots of information
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:29.140]   and getting a handle on it and getting it organized, your first click is going to be
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   Bento.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:36.140]   I had an idea to do a, I don't want to spoil the surprise, but a certain subject, a day
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.140]   calendar.
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:42.420]   Anyway, just to cut to the point, even on FileMaker, which is one of the easiest database programs
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.820]   out there, you have to think about what fields you want to put in there and then you have
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:51.580]   to build a form for data entry and then develop a table for looking at that data.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:58.300]   With Bento, it's just give me an empty screen, describe the sort of data that you want.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.300]   After making two, three or four different entries, you decide, "Oh, you know what?
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.940]   I think this field should be up here.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.540]   I don't have to change to a forms layout mode.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.860]   I just simply grab what I want and put it where it needs to be."
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.420]   For all that, it's like 50 bucks, 49 stinking, miserable stinking bucks.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:19.020]   It directly reads and writes spreadsheet format files, so you don't have to export to CSV
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.540]   or anything like that.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.020]   It really is the first database that enters that category of just buy it, just half it
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.020]   on your hard drive.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:29.420]   Eventually, you'll find a need for it and then you'll be glad that you had it.
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.780]   We got Bento as speakers at Macworld, the first edition, and I played with it, but it
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.780]   didn't knock me out.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:40.900]   You think Bento 2 is enough improvement that it's worth taking a second look at.
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:41.900]   Definitely.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   I just seem very simple.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:44.900]   I like FileMaker.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.940]   I think the problem is that those of us who use FileMaker are used to more tools and
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:50.940]   more control.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:57.540]   For us, I think going down to Bento was, for me, I thought it was really, really cool,
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:01.060]   but I still wanted a bunch of stuff that I can do in FileMaker.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:10.860]   I know that Flighty, Alberta Straub, who does the cocktails on the fly, and she was just
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.820]   trying to get all of her recipes in one place.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:18.380]   She can be technical in some ways, but she's just really not going to ever open FileMaker
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.380]   and create something.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:22.820]   Bento was the thing that was just perfect for her.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:27.260]   I was just talking to her and she just said it was just the perfect thing for her to throw
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.060]   together a database and change things if she needed it and keep on adding all the little
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.460]   notes and all the little pieces.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:36.060]   Every time she had, "Oh, I need to add another field," and that's really where the stuff
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.580]   becomes powerful is when you can actually create something.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:46.300]   I think that for people who haven't used FileMaker, or don't depend heavily on FileMaker, and
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:50.780]   they're just trying to get their life organized, get their data in one place, you've got to
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:51.980]   have something to start with.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.820]   I think Bento, I agree with Andy.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.980]   I think Bento is just an incredible place to start.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.980]   It's probably the best.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.980]   I have to say, look at it.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:59.980]   It's only 49 bucks.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.980]   It's $24.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:07.220]   And don't think that your basic addresses recipe cards and your baseball card collection
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.820]   database, because you can do stuff like that with it.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:16.780]   The top most powerful things you can build with FileMaker, far, far exceed the top most
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.940]   complicated things you can do with Bento.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:23.380]   But for most users, even most professional users, I think that you have to be using Bento
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:28.700]   for a long time before you hit something that you absolutely must use a "real" and "database"
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.700]   program for.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.900]   I'll wait for my copy at Macworld.
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:32.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.660]   We're speaking at Macworld.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.740]   FileMaker, just make sure there's one in the bag.
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:37.740]   Will you?
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.740]   Please talk about it.
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740]   We would all like a free copy of Bento.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.940]   In fact, would you just please go through our picks of the "E"?
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.940]   Put them all in there.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.540]   Hold them all in there.
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:52.780]   I'm going to have a -- since I've had such good results with my anti-picks of the week,
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:55.820]   last week, and I'm going to do another anti-pick of the week.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:00.380]   This is a pick of something you absolutely don't want to have, but I want to warn you
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.700]   about something called Mac Guard.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.060]   Now, Antigua has sent out this warning.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:12.260]   Mac Guard is a clone of something that has been on Windows for a while called Wind Guard.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.660]   It is basically spyware.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:16.180]   It's bogus security software.
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.500]   You're going to see this around.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:22.260]   You may even get warnings on your system from pop-up windows as you surf the net.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:29.500]   Wind Guard claims to be a high-tech system scanner that will look for adware, spyware,
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.420]   and Trojans eliminating threats, securing your privacy in minutes.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.460]   In fact, it is a Trojan.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.340]   It is spyware.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   It's really important.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:46.780]   I think we Mac users have been so blessed with secure systems for so long that we're perhaps
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.020]   maybe a little bit more vulnerable to these scams.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.580]   Windows users know now by now that if somebody offers you something, you think twice before
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.940]   you download it and install it.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:59.980]   The company is called EnovaJest 2000SL.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.740]   We don't know exactly what they're doing.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.180]   They don't get any software.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.940]   They may be harvesting credit card numbers.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.780]   We don't know.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:12.140]   This is from Sunbelt Malware Research Labs.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:18.540]   If you do get an offer for Mac Guard and you'll see these ads look very realistic, do not
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:24.220]   get suckered into that and do not fall for it and do not, whatever you do, go to macguard.net
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.300]   because it's bogus.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.220]   So my pick is an anti-pick.
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:34.180]   I got lots of pro picks, but that's my warning of the week is not to fall for that one.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:38.260]   I didn't know we get to do things that suck on this show because I got a lot.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:41.060]   Well, I'll do a little one just a little throw in that I just...
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.220]   You can't all do Skype.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.220]   Come on, guys.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.980]   I just got to know that's exactly right.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.780]   Not everything is not everything sucked.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.860]   I just got a note from a smile on my Mac.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.460]   They do the great text expander among other things and I love text spander and I use it
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.420]   religiously.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.020]   They have written a little...
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:03.340]   If you have text spander, you can add text expander, you can add little snippets to it
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:08.980]   and they offer a smile on my Mac on their blog offers quite a few little fun little snippets.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:14.900]   If you go to smile on my Mac.net, you can see a lot of the snippets and so forth.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:18.940]   The newest one, I think it's really cool.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.580]   It does a URL shortener.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.860]   So I use URL shortening all the time every time I Twitter and so forth.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.140]   I want to have a short URL.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.380]   I've got a little Apple script.
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:30.220]   I didn't know this but text expander supports Apple script as well.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.300]   A little Apple script that will run.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:39.460]   So you copy a URL onto your clipboard and then you type ttrim and it will automatically
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:46.300]   replace it with a shortened version of the URL using the tr.im service.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:47.300]   Very cool.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.860]   So if you're a text expander user, it's free.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.860]   It's a little download.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:54.660]   You can get it from smile on my Mac.net/blog.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.540]   If you don't have text expander, why not?
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.940]   That's a long time favorite Mac break weekly.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:03.380]   I use it every day about life saver.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.180]   By 20 or 30 times a day now.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   Absolutely.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.700]   Every time I'm saying the same thing a couple times, in fact, my NFR requests now, NFRs
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.660]   are not for resale.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.980]   It's the initial part of the NFR is a text expander.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.500]   Just type NFR requests and then just go here's who I am.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:24.940]   This is what I do.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:25.940]   I don't make any typos.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:26.940]   I don't have anything.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.180]   And then I just change a couple of little things and then I'm done.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:34.060]   I had no idea you could do Apple script within that opens up a whole new world of excitement
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060]   for me.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:38.060]   So I'm going to have to start playing with that because you could use it as an application
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.060]   launcher.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.620]   You can have it do background stuff.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.300]   I mean, this is pretty cool.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.980]   So text expander would be a pick, but it's not a new pick.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.540]   So I'm not going to take credit for it.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.220]   Let's go to Alex Lindsey for his pick.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:53.980]   So I like to make textures.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:58.140]   So textures are the little things that you wrap on to objects to make them look real.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:03.100]   So when you make something in 3D, you might, you know, the, it'll just look like plastic
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.380]   until you put a picture on it.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:09.580]   Also you might use a texture for your background on your, you know, background on your website
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:12.140]   or your back or other things like that.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:16.100]   And one of the hard things about doing that is making it, making it repeatable so that
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.700]   if you have it, you have a small picture and you want to repeat it over and over and over
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:21.180]   again, but you want, you don't want to see the seams.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:25.180]   You know, you don't want to see the edges around those, those images.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:28.740]   And you know, if you're kind of smart, you can go into Photoshop and you can offset it
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.260]   and then you can, you can clone it and it works pretty well.
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:37.340]   But it's, it's time consuming and, and there is a program that will do it for you.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:41.780]   Once it's called image sense, and I think you can find it at Luxology.com.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:45.820]   And what image sense does is it takes the image and you can actually you open it up and
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.900]   you can open it in Photoshop or as a standalone.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.540]   I like to use the standalone myself.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:55.820]   And so what you can do is you can take an image of, let's say, marbles or, or stone or
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:58.020]   grass and you want to cover it a whole image.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:01.020]   You want to cover your whole scene with it, but you only want, only have like a little
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.260]   chunk of it.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:07.100]   So what you can do is you can just start pacing in it and it smartly figures out where all
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.500]   the little edges are and where it all should kind of fit together.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.740]   And it kind of does this thing where you can kind of clone them together, but it's figuring
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:16.140]   out how to blend them together.
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:21.700]   And what you get is a very, usually a very, very good result of something that is seamless.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.940]   So once you fill the whole thing, all the edges, it's figured out like when you paste
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:29.100]   near the edge, it's figured out, oh, I got to put that at the bottom to make sure that
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.660]   when this is repeated, either horizontally or vertically, it's going to, you know, look
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.100]   like it blends from one side to the other.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:40.700]   So it's a really, really cool tool if you're interested in that kind of thing.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.620]   It's, it's one seventh of an Alex.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.620]   By the way, we had a question.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:47.300]   An Alex, I think we haven't said is $700.
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.100]   But it's a it's a 99 bucks.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.580]   And I got like three emails about it last week.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.580]   I don't know why.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.620]   And so it's so anyway, image send.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.940]   It's the cost of Photoshop.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.940]   Someone.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.620]   Yeah, someone, someone just says, I got three emails last week going.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:01.620]   What the hell is that?
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:02.620]   What is it?
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   What is it?
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.620]   Everyone knew it.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.780]   So, so anyway, it's it's $99.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:10.220]   And if you're, you know, if you're trying to figure this out and you're trying to save
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.580]   a little time and you want to make something fast that looks really, really good for either
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:16.540]   3D or your web stuff or even background of print.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:19.820]   I mean, there's no resolution dependency here.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.580]   Check it out at Luxology.com.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   Very.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   The samples here are incredible.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   It's it's crazy.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.420]   Like you're like, you're like, I imagine little gnomes in my computer just going, I'm
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   going to paint this.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   I'm going to get this out.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.420]   I'm going to figure this out.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.060]   You know, I've seen, I've seen tools like that and it's more like you're thinking, okay,
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.700]   a little, a little mosaic or a little like bathroom tile things.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.180]   But they have just like a random like handful of wrapped candies and it's turned into an
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.660]   infinite tabletop of wrapped candies with this tool.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   I sure.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.660]   It's not.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:52.220]   This is not like, oh, we're just going to soften the edges and blend them over top of
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.220]   each other.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.500]   That's not the old like Photoshop seamless stuff.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.020]   This is like big heavy code that is figuring out how to put all the stuff together.
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.020]   It's really nice.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.620]   I'm often taking pictures.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:07.340]   I think you taught me this, Alex, when I see some interesting texture, I'll take a picture
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:09.820]   of it thinking I'll use it for web design or something.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.060]   But then you have to make it seamless.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.660]   It's a real pain in the butt.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.660]   So this is really neat.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:20.780]   A hundred bucks, a seventh of an Alex Luxology dot com and that concludes this edition of
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:28.220]   Mac break weekly before we go though, Andy, G one phone, thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:33.960]   Thumbs up in the same way that the first Mac was a thumbs up that if you really look
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.520]   at it in the context of what it represents and what it could become, you're really excited
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.440]   about what is going to be in a year or two or three.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.360]   It's going to hurt a little bit for the next three for the next three, four months.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.400]   I mean, it's you're going to wonder how they're going to advertise features like and visit
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:55.000]   the visit the Google online app store now featuring over 30 application.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   Kind of.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   It's.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.200]   It's a I have a I got to my views up in the sun times.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:06.240]   I'm doing a serial like long brain dump at my website.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.760]   Now I'm about 5000 words and I think about halfway through it is probably if the iPhone
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.800]   did not exist, I would think it's the greatest smartphone out there because I do think it's
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.920]   a very, very nicely articulate and a nice articulation of the idea of not a touch not
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.920]   a touch based phone, but a keyboard and a little thumb track wheel phone.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.440]   It's very, very comfortable, very nice to use.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.440]   Very good.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.440]   Thank you all.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   I really appreciate your time.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.800]   Again, once again, our best wishes to Leona Lahua.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.920]   We can't wait to get you back on the show, Leona.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.960]   So breathe deep, take care, get better soon at our thoughts and prayers are with you.
