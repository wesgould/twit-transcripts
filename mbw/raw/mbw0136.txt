[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.200]   Mac-intoshy.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.520]   Oh, Mac-intoshy, Mac-intoshy.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.840]   And here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.480]   direct from his live engagement at the BBC World Service
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.920]   in London, England, Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920]   Hello.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.600]   How was it?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   It was amazing.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.620]   Fun?
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.760]   Amazing.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.160]   It was-- I just-- I had such a great time.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   And you were nicely treated by the beeb?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.440]   Yes, Matt Wade, who was someone who knows me on Twitter
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240]   when I said I was coming to London,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.760]   asked if I wanted to see a little bit of the BBC World
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.080]   Service.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.600]   This is mostly the radio services.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.320]   They have some video services.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.000]   And one of the things that's crazy
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.640]   is that they have operating studios that-- some of them,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.880]   I think, were built in the '50s.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.560]   And some of them are built last year.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.400]   And so you can see the entire range of a--
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.040]   --professional studio from one floor to another.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.440]   And--
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   It's amazing.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.280]   I mean, everything from these super high tech glass
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.480]   enclosed studios to ribbon mics hanging from the floor
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.280]   where the only way to change the volume is to move closer.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.320]   You know, you know.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   So I mean, between two people, because you had one pot on--
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.840]   You would have loved this.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.280]   Scott Borne is also here from scottborne.com.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.880]   Hello, Scotty.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.240]   Hello.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.760]   I definitely was very jealous when
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.480]   Alex was sending me emails from there.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.440]   And I was like, oh, man.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.640]   I took like a 200 photos.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   So I'm going to get them up slowly for probably about--
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   So that would be great to see.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.800]   You know, ribbon mics.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.000]   If you've never worked with a ribbon mic,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.720]   there's a challenge for you.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   Well, they sound very warm, right?
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.360]   Isn't that-- they are very warm.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   But boy, they are touchy and testy
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.680]   and not for the faint of heart to play with.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.400]   Touchy and testy and not for the faint of heart.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.600]   It sounds like Andy and I go.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.760]   Oh, I'm just kidding.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280]   Hey, Andy, how-- it's just because you were next.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   That's all the reason you got that one.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.680]   Did you mute yourself, Andrew?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.280]   Yeah, I was muting myself as your punishment
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.120]   for being mean to me.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.560]   Oh, that's good.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.480]   It's like a teenager.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.280]   All they can do is withhold, right?
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   There's nothing else you can do to play.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.480]   Did you solve the world problems last week, Andy?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.960]   Excuse me?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.440]   Did you solve the world's problems last week?
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.920]   Well, I was only responsible for 18% of the world's problems.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.480]   But I was definitely on top of things.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.840]   So if you have one of those faulty, like, one lever shower
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   adjustment novels that you can really never get
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   the temperature quite right, it's going to start working on Wednesday.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   Give me the thing.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.920]   Andy was at the--
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.360]   It's just that easy.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.640]   What was it?
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   The world solved the problem, counsel.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.600]   The world is in Colorado.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   What was the name of that?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.080]   The Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.520]   The 61st annual Conference on World Affairs.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.720]   And do they live up to your expectations?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.440]   What's-- well, let me put it this way.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.240]   The quintessential Conference on World Affairs experience
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.280]   at this Opie Night Party Sunday night,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.080]   I'm talking to this guy who I was introduced to.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.040]   Well, his name is Rameen.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.720]   He makes movies.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.360]   I'm having great conversations with him.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.800]   And of course, we talk about technology.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.080]   And I basically fix him with his computer's problems for him.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   And then I get back to the rumor I'm staying.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.680]   I googled his name and find out that he's made three movies.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.200]   He's been in-- he's been in Cannes.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   He's been in Toronto Film Festival.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.880]   He's been in every single prestigious film festival ever.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.400]   And then I go out to dinner with him on Wednesday night
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.920]   and learned from him that earlier that day,
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.840]   he won a Guggenheim fellowship.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.440]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.960]   Wow.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.480]   Which point I said, yeah, well, I won my third Pulitzer
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   yesterday.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.520]   I didn't want to be a show off and bring it up.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.640]   And now that we're talking about what prestigious things
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.720]   we've won.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.480]   Wow.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.440]   That's amazing.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.760]   I'm only one punch away from winning
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.600]   another free slice of pizza at the Upper Press in Waltham.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   I got the card.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.920]   I got a card with the Guggenheim people.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.120]   Give you a punch card.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.880]   10 Guggenheims and you get a Nobel.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.520]   It's great.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.600]   Yes, exactly.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.320]   So first story brought to us by the lovely and talented
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.040]   Scott Born.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.280]   Apple's got a new Mac.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.600]   Well, I have a 20-inch iMac for the education market
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.680]   end of story.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.040]   OK, next story.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.960]   Item two.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.040]   It really wasn't much to say, was there?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.800]   No, no, I think it's just because some people complained
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.880]   about affordability and small size.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.960]   And Apple probably said, well, there's really no market
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.920]   for that except maybe in the college dorm room.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.440]   So they did it.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.320]   So how much is it?
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   $8.99.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.120]   Something like this.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.360]   Oh, well, wait a minute.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.160]   That's a story.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.160]   That's a good price.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.360]   But I just got news of a bigger possible story.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.960]   And it's the kind that will create angst amongst the millions.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   And it's the fact that the new display port is allegedly not
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   running monitors over 1,600 by 1,200 unless they're Apple
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   cinema displays.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   Oh, this could be some sort of conspiracy.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   Conspiracy.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   Yes.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   Huh.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   Well, I've only used Apple cinema displays with my mini
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   display port, so I don't know.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   So I've used two.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   But I think it's something, if this is true, I think it's worth
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   noting if you're thinking about buying a monitor and connecting
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   it and finding out it doesn't work might make you unhappy.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   Very much worth noting.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   Absolutely worth noting.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   But I have no personal proof of this.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   This is just this came to me over the internets.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   Is it my imagination or do PC users oftentimes or PC companies
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   oftentimes set up their windows to be a much higher resolution
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   than very frequently?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   Because I was my laptop that said it like 1920 by 1080.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   Yeah, I was at my dad's, you know, sharing my dad.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   I bought my parents iPhone or iPods, you know, over the weekend
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   and I was showing my dad how to use iTunes and the iPod and he
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   was squinting at the screen and then I realized that I was
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   squinting at the screen and so he's got a PC and I just, I couldn't
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   read anything on it and I felt like I was getting away.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   I think it's funny because he's squinting in it too.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   I think it's a way manufacturers get their specs looking good.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   Right.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   Right.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   Oh, this is a 1920 by or 1200 screen.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   It was painful, but it's too small.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   This is the Dell 16 I bought.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   It's a 16 inch laptop and in order to run 1080p movies, you know,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   full resolution, it's a 1080 screen.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   Although you can never see the difference between a 1080p or
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   or 540p at that screen size.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   Absolutely not.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   And that's the problem I had with the 30 inch Apple cinema
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   display.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   I would, you know, everybody was like, oh, you got the 30 inch
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   Apple cinema display and then I realized I had to get one of those
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   old lady magnifier hoods to put in front of it to where I could
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   actually read anything.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   If you had it at full resolution.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   Yeah, if I had it at full resolution, that's so when they came
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   out with the 24s.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   A friend of mine said he was getting RSI in his neck with the
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   30 inch.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   He went down to it.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   He went back to a 24 because he said all that head turning just
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   to move around on the desktop.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   You know, in some ways, in some ways having a 224s is superior to
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   a single 30.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   That's what we're moving to.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   We're not, we're not going to do that.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   Yeah, I have a, I have a 30 upstairs.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   Notice I'm using a 24 down here.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   Right.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   24 are so stinkin bright.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   I like them.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   We will.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   I bought one for Alex to use when he's here in the office.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   And the integration is just, I mean, it is so nice.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   Well, you know, when I got the new mini and I said to Colleen,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   I don't have to go, I have to borrow your keyboard and mouse
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   and monitor because I need to set up.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   She said, we got the 24 in the other room.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   You plug it in, boom, boom, boom.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   It's there.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   You're done.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   And it's, and it's, and it works and it's, it really is not.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   I mean, it's pricey, especially for your laptop though.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   I mean, the fact that you can plug that you can power your laptop
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   from the monitor, you know, it's not even power, you know,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   because it's just got the little power jack.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   And so you just plug it all the little, all the little pieces in real quick.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   Boom, you're up.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   It is the perfect companion.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   You know, they're talking.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   Somebody just sent me this.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   And it actually works in terms of sleep, not sleep, all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.960]   If you got your laptop closed, you hook it up.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   It just wakes up and just, it shows up on the big monitor.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   No problem.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   And I never had him had it work before properly like that.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   And that we put him side by side with the old display.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   And I always liked the old display, but my gosh, it's so much brighter.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.960]   It's just, I ordered that we immediately strike all the older ones
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   from the area and replace them with the new ones.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   Although still get the integration with the Mac Pro, I think is a little messy.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   Yeah, that's messy.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   Believe me, that's messy.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   But there are these really wise parties.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.960]   It's just designed that lap, that monitor right now is just designed to be used with a laptop.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   It's not for that laptop.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   Well, I know, I just plugged it into the Mac Pro down there.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960]   It worked fine.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   With the display port?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   Okay, maybe it's just the brand new ones.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   We were looking at getting new ones.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   That was the 24 with a brand new Mac Pro.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   Both the new ones.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   It only works on the new Mac Pro.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   Only on the same.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   Oh, if you have the one generation earlier, it's just a mess.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   It's a world of hurt.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   We hired an electrical engineer to build us a cable to make it work on our Mac Pro.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   Marmont sent me this interesting story from 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   Collins America introduces mini display port cinema display knockoffs.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   The 19 inch is $2.99.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   The 20 inch is $3.99.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   $4.99 for 24 inch display, by the way, set at 1920 by 1080.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   That ridiculous high resolution PC style.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   But it has mini display port.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   It has a three port USB 2 powered hub.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   It looks like it's got a camera built in.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   It's a die cast.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   It's called Colley.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   It's good.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   Go to 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   It's Collins America.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   It is.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   Oh, we yep, is it?
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   It doesn't.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   I'm wondering.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   That's very interesting.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   LG makes the ones for Apple.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   Three port USB 2.0 powered hub.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   Pass through stereo audio.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   Die cast aluminum glass.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   Native display port.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   I don't know.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   Does it say camera?
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Maybe it doesn't have a...
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   You know, it'll be a lot cheaper and you'll get what you pay for.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   I think it's going to be better if you...
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   We tried...
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   And I hate to say...
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   I mean, we've ordered a bunch of different monitors and we've just become very hardened
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   about the fact that we just like our Apple monitors.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   It's easy to do a knockoff and then you cut stuff that people don't realize you're cutting.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   Well, there's a huge difference between the statistics matching and the quality matching.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   I mean, that's the thing that with cameras or computers or monitors...
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   You sound like Mac Biggitso.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   I mean, when you say that, do you really think that's true?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   It's not just a...
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   All I know is that we were trying to save money and we started buying Dell and HP monitor,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   you know, displays thinking that we would save some money on them.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   We bought two of them and we got two into it and decided we'll never do that again.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   And so we were trying to get away for it because we were like, "Oh, these are too expensive" and blah,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   blah, blah.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   And we just had more trouble with those two displays that the HP and the Dell monitors
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   that we were just like, "Ah, enough of this."
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   It's a thicker bezel than the Apple ones.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   Alex, what was your difficulty with it?
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   Because I know that you're a professional and it comes to imagery,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.960]   but if this was somebody who just wants to do basic photo editing...
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   If you're running Excel, it'll work fine.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   It was mostly the color was crap.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   The contrast was crap and the HP monitor died.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   So it just looks crunchy.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   I don't know how to say it.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   I mean, it just looked pixelated and I don't know why it looked pixelated.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   The same resolution that the Mac one didn't and it just looked...
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   It looks bad.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   It has bad...
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   I said it just...
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   We can't trust it at all.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   So it's just used for rough monitoring stuff now.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   We've kind of rotated it out and away from any real work.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   You know, and that's fine.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   Well, yeah, I tend to think of the ultimate setup is to have a 24-inch iMac.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   So you have one good calibrated display that Apple knows and Apple trusts.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   And then go to Office Macs and spend 200 bucks for a very good Samsung as your secondary display
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   as a place to put the web browser windows and stuff like that.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   Well, I'm not going to match.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   Well, no, who cares?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   Well, and I say for the Mac mini that I have in my office that runs the Drobo and just runs my library and stuff,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   that's where I'm using the HP monitor after I got it working again.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   And I don't really care what it looks like.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   I don't watch the movies on it.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   All it does is holds lots of information.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   So in that case, it is worth buying a cheaper monitor because I'm not spending all day looking at it.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   And for those kind of monitors, I don't think you should buy an Apple display because it is too much money
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   for something that isn't going to require any kind of critical...
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   I'm not going to spend all day looking at it and I don't have any critical needs for it.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   In that case, I would definitely go out and buy a cheaper monitor.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   And that's what we do.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   So you're right, Andy, in that case.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   I mean, I believe it or not, I spent the entire week last week.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   I decided to eat my own dog food when it came to that Delmini 9 and use that.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   I didn't bring any other computer but the...
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   Oh, and absolutely true when I put it next to it.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   When I put it next to my MacBook Pro, boy, does that screen not look like something I would like pictures of anybody I love to be on it.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   But it certainly works just fine for mobile use.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   By itself, it looks fine, right?
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   I mean, if you're not looking at something else to compare it with.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   Yeah, and also, but the main point is that it wasn't doing like, you know, commercial photo editing, commercial video editing.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   I mean, it would have been unsuitable for it anyway.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   I think that I wish Apple were better at communicating the technical differences between those...
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   these really expensive monitors that you get at the Apple store and the stuff that's just cheerfully inexpensive.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   And also as an ATSC tuner built in that you get a Staples and Office Max, especially as they're doing funnier things now
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   by creating custom connectors that may or may not work with the machines that you already have.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   Well, I have to admit, I bought the 24 even though it just looked really expensive and it is just elegant.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   But you know what? When I was my latest machine, I checked all the monitors.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   I spent time talking to Andy and Naco and I spent time talking to Chris Breen.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   I spent time talking to a lot of people and said, you know, I've always just bought the Apple monitors.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   I'm going to check around this time.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   I looked at the Samsung, I looked at the NEC, and I just ended up liking the way the Apple looked.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   And some of the third-party solutions were actually more expensive.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   At least, of course, I'm looking once again at high-end stuff because I'm doing professional photography editing on these monitors.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   But I don't think it's a bad decision to buy the Apple, you know, into great-look monitor.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   Oh, no. I don't think it's a bad decision at all.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   I mean, the best analog I can have is, you know, my rock-port shoes just probably gave up the ghost last week.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   And everyone's telling me, oh, you should buy these Mephisto shoes. They're great.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   They last a hundred years, and they're comfortable, all this sort of stuff.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Chris Breen is a big fan. Chris Breen, the common element of this talk.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   Expert on monitors and shoes. And I'm like, I got this.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   He's a Renaissance man.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   Exactly.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   So, I'm just saying...
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   That's just not as special.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   Everybody has, by the way, Andy.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   Shoes and monitor.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   Well, you know, this kind of economy, you've got to specialize.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   But, you know, I feel the same way about these shoes as I do about certain monitors.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   I can't spend $450 on shoes. I just plain can't.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   And I think that there are a lot of people in that exact same boat.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   I cannot spend... I cannot spend $800 for a monitor where I can probably get...
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   Not as good a monitor, but just as functional a monitor, at least, for $300 or $400.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   In that case, I would recommend the Samsungs, because I tested a lot of the Samsungs,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   and they came the closest to looking good enough for me and were way cheaper.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   Yeah, we use a lot of Samsung monitors here, yeah.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   I bought a...
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   They usually had more inputs and outputs than the Apple monitors.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   They're built great and they look great.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   I bought my first Samsung in November, like a 22-inch, just as a secondary monitor.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   And also something I could use as a kitchen TV if I needed it.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   And I liked it so much that when I got my first big 40-inch HD TV a couple of weeks ago,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   it was also a Samsung.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   I think they're tops in terms of quality.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   That golden ratio between acceptable quality and really, really, really desirable affordability.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   Yeah, that's actually the HD TV I have at home as a Samsung.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   Which I like a lot.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   It's funny, because they used to be the crap monitor... the crap TVs that you'd buy at Target.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   And all the Korean companies were kind of crappy.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   Congratulations, you might have won either a 1981 Buick Skylock or an HD TV.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   [laughter]
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.960]   Front page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.960]   Steve Jobs maintains grip.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   The iron grip of Steve Jobs, they interviewed anonymous sources, which makes me think of the Jim Goldman anonymous sources.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   Jobs is falling, he's not sick, he's not sick at all.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   Which I imagine came from Apple's PR department.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   Wall Street Journal, these guys are pretty good journalists.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   More than three months into the medical leave from Apple Incorporated, chief executive Steve Jobs,
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   I'm quoting the journal, "remains closely involved in key aspects of running the company."
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Say people familiar with the matter.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   John Gruber wrote a funny note.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   He says, "Wall Street Journal discovers Apple doing exactly what they said they would do all along."
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   [laughter]
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   The board says, "Actually Steve Dowling," Apple spokesman says,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   "Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June."
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   The board says, "We are in touch with Jobs and his doctors at all times,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   and we still expect him to come back in June."
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   I mean, this is interesting.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   I don't know why this story emerged, but I have a feeling that Apple's pushing this as a story that this is...
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:39.960]   Because we also found out that Steve Jobs was personally responsible for coordinating the Seal Team Attack on the pirate station.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   Wasn't that something?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   Go Seal!
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   Sea air and land for the wind.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   Man, they're amazing.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   My wife was talking to a Seal mom yesterday about the training that these guys go through,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   and the rigors of it.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   And this guy ended up serving 16 years as a Seal, and is now on a SWAT team in Sacramento.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   Just amazing.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   I mean, these guys...
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   You know, everybody laughed at me when I said that Obama should appoint Jerry Bruckheimer to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   Who's laughing now?
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   Well, you know Bruckheimer's got to be working on that.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   It's an option to story.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   Somebody has.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   I mean, what a story that makes, huh?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   Can you imagine it?
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   It's 80 feet away.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   It's at night.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   It's in rough seas, and the ship is moving up and down, and side to side as much as two to four feet every few seconds.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   And you have a window about 24 inches wide you're shooting through, and you have a couple of seconds at that to coordinate three exactly timed shots to do it.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   It's amazing.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   I mean, you've got a better chance of marrying Madonna and becoming the next president of the United States.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   It's really amazing.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   These guys are just unbelievable.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.960]   There's a lot of tech involved in this.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   I mean, a ton of tech.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   These guys practice with a lot of technology that, you know, really comes from computers.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   So I think it's interesting to see if they use Max.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   You know, it's funny.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   I don't know whether to credit this or not, but Steve Gibson got a letter from somebody who, I believe, purported to be on a SEAL team in Afghanistan.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   It's thanking him for spin right because their PC drives have gone down, and they were able to save them.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   And, you know, you can never prove that it's a true story.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   We could chew guys at night, but we can't get a hard drive.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   Well, imagine in those conditions, they must have some pretty ruggedized systems.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   Well, they do.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   They have ruggedized systems and, you know, they have stuff that's waterproof and all kinds of stuff.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   These guys were parachuted in.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   They landed in the water.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   Then they put together a raft.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   Then they got on board the boat.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.960]   Then they got in position stealth all blacked out.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   Then they waited until night.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   They used a thermal infrared device, not just infrared, not just thermal, but a combination.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   And it's just, you know, I think it's fascinating technology.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   And, you know, forget the politics and the crime and all the stuff that went on.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   Just just look at the technology behind it.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   I have to admit that the moment I told my wife the moment I saw that they had hijacked an American ship.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   Well, my reaction was, I think this is not going to turn out well for them.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   No.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   I was like, there's a big difference between, you know, our team and the truth of the matter,
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   is our team and the French teams are going to react very differently than most of the rest of the world.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   You know, because the French are kind of known for being publicly very easygoing and privately very rough.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   Oh, really?
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   I know that.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   And they sort of that they kind of reacted similarly to what we did.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   So anyway, I don't know how that has to do with Max, but it was an interesting part of a little side track.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   I was talking about Steve Jobs and all of a sudden it was the seals.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   I don't know what happened.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   I just made a joke.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   It's my fault.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   I apologize.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   What was your job in the service, Scott?
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   What did you do?
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   I was an airborne ranger.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   Okay.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   Okay.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   He knows where AV speaks.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   We didn't have to get wet.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   That was about the only difference.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   We jumped out of airplanes.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   And we did not have to get wet.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Nor would I have allowed myself to get wet.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   Unless it was raining.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   Even then, even then, even then they didn't get wet.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Yep.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   Have a umbrella carrier.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   It's like Chuck Norris.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960]   Chuck Norris doesn't get wet.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Water gets Chuck Norris.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   So at least you can say that your time over there was not absolutely completely as miserable as it could have possibly ever have been.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   That's correct.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   It's more of a 99.99999% as best as it could have been.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   But not wet.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   Right?
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   Well, I tell you what, I, you know, Special Forces Group and all the people that do tactical operations, all the operators in the field that represent the United States Armed Forces receive a level of training and go through a hell that most people just simply cannot understand 75% of people that go to seal training, wash out in the first week.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   And, you know, I don't talk much about these sorts of things on the show, but I'm very proud of our guys.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.960]   No kidding.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   No kidding.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   Tough as straining there is.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   And that's an understatement.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   Getting back to the...
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   It would be tougher for me to actually learn how to use a Windows machine.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   That's other than that.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   I can see the headline.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   Scott Bourne says seals must use Max.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   They're that good.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   By the way, did you see this thing that 83% of companies do not intend to adopt Windows 7?
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   That's a surprise because Windows 7 seems to me a perfect...
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   They don't plan to adopt it the next year.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   I should be more interested.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   How many are still using XP?
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   I think we're still using XP.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   Microsoft believes, and I think most observers believe that a lot of companies skipped Vista.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   And we're waiting with interest for 7 because they are still using XP.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   I was using Vista on my dad's machine.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   I was banging my head on the wall.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   It's not great.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   It's crap.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   I want to know what's the specific percentage then of Apple users who don't upgrade when
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   there's a new OS.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   I'd like to compare those.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   Oh, it's very high percentage upgrade as I remember.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   It was something like 80%.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   Jobs was talking about that.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   I think it's one of the keynotes.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   But I think that part of that is that the whole system on the Mac is geared to almost...
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   If you want to do anything current, you know, so much of the new software.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   You need a leopard to run a lot of the new programs.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   Exactly.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   And that constantly moves forward.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   I think that there's a whole different culture of the...
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.960]   We kind of let go of the past pretty quickly on the Mac where you just can't run anything,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   you know, on backwards compatibility.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   I know we have become harder and harder about, like when we're developing software, that we just
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   develop it for the current operating system on the Mac.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   And we just...
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   We'll give everybody about three to six months.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   And then from then on, we won't support anything older than that.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   So there's that culture of you got to move on.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   Also, it's a lot easier to move on.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   I mean, going from one major revision of Windows to another is painful.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   Usually requires new hardware.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   I mean, almost always...
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   I can remember going back to '95 saying to people, "Don't buy the new version of Windows,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   buy a new computer."
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   That's kind of the Microsoft way.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   Very few people buy Windows, you know, shrink wrapped at the store.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   It comes with their computer and they never upgrade to the upgrade their computer.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   It's completely different in the Mac.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   Because it's $129, it's an easy upgrade.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   And you get benefit usually.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   Right.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   Some significant benefit.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   I mean, I still have a very useful HP tower box right here in my office that I just can't
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   use anymore because the video driver is incompatible with something that I just upgraded.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   And by the time I figured out what was wrong with it and why I can't get any video of any kind out of it
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   so I can diagnose the problem further, I realized that Andy, you're spending a lot of time trying to
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   get a Windows machine to work.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   But it's...
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   Put it next to your chair, put your drinks on top of it and it'll still be useful.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   They finally, to finish out this New York-Ehrthe-Relt Wall Street Journal story, they say job recruiters
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   in Silicon Valley are not seeing big Apple employee turnover.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   However, executives say they are at some companies who are saying they're getting more interested
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   than before from Apple.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   Managers, particularly those in mid to upper levels, I don't know if that indicates anything about
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   jobs return or not.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   An analyst at Coffin Brothers says investors by now have factored into the stock price,
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   the possibility that jobs may not play a fool.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   I totally would only go up if he does what he said he was going to do and come back in June.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   That'd be a big jump.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   You think Scott is an investor that's...
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   I totally agree that they've already factored it in and that if he does come back, you'll see a bump.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   By the way, Apple's stock price is performing quite well.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   Much better than everyone else.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   Not everyone else, but most of the NASDAQ, since December, they've been up significantly.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   I think it's 40%.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.960]   NASDAQ has been up five.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   Remember, they came down from almost 200 and they came down before the rest of the market.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   They had an adjustment in between that period.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   I think that it's reasonable to think that they're going to do pretty well.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   Of course, all you've got to do is look at the cash positions of some of these tech companies.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   They're very cash rich right now.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   Down economy, being cash rich gives you all kinds of opportunity.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   Those companies that are marginal, that are teetering, that are sitting over there on the fence
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   going, "How are we going to make payroll?"
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   If they have something really cool, Apple is in a position to go, "Come over here.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   Let me talk to you for a minute."
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   I do believe that it's more than likely that Steve Jobs will return in June as scheduled.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   But don't you think that that's a little bit of extra insulation that Apple has against?
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   Sometimes if the new iPhone has wings, as everybody thought, but can only hover for 40 seconds
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   next year, instead of the full-free-minisets rumored, the stock price goes down.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Don't you think that automatically, if Steve Jobs takes that stage, we see a stock price bump
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   and any halo effect is going to raise everything?
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.960]   That doesn't matter what they release or do not release that day as long as they release
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   Steve Jobs in captivity.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.960]   Wow.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   Do we think that's what's going to happen?
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   I think he's coming back, but here's what I think is really important about this time
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   that we're in right now.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   The company is doing well and operating fine and meeting its deadlines and producing
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   stuff and he's not there day to day.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   So that sort of allows that sigh of relief.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   Nobody knows what impact he's having from home and his vision will guide the company,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   in my opinion, long after he's gone.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   I can still imagine how many every years it might be from now after he's dead, people
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   saying, "Now, what would Steve do?"
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   Because that worked out to be a pretty good question to ask while he was there.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   And I think there's an incredible focus that is at Apple that will remain there for a
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   long time, whether Steve returns to Apple or not.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   And I definitely think he's probably very involved with it probably day to day.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   He's like, "That's the impression that I got from the story that that's what they were
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   trying to say in the story is that these decisions are being made right now by Steve
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   day to day.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   That all makes sense to you.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   Scott Bourne, does that make sense to you?
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   I don't know how...
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   I don't think they're coming to him that often and going, "Steve, should we do this or this?
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   Steve, so-and-so wants to quit.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   Should we offer more money?"
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   I don't think it's that kind of deal.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   I think it's more along the lines of the 30,000 foot level stuff.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   And then the managers that he trusts, and clearly he does trust them, will go in and
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   execute.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   I can see it just more like the Jack in the box commercial where Jack is in the bed and
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   the assistant comes in and says, "Don't worry, I'm changing the name of the company."
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   Now that could be funny.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   That was pretty funny.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.960]   What was the name of the company?
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   What was he going to change it to?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   Bob.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   Fred in the box or something.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   Fred in the box.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   Change the Bob in the box.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   No, no, but it had a funny connotation.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   Oh, I can't remember.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   It was just the whole notion that that broke Jack.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   Funny it was the Jack in the box?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah, that brought Jack back from the dead.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   It did.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   You know, I think something like that could be interesting.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:37.600]   But I'm really glad to see that all the raw rawing almost for Steve's death has sort of
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.960]   died down and people have realized life is life and things are moving.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   I want the company, as I want all companies to be successful, because as a consumer I
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.680]   want to be able to get cool stuff from them.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.440]   And I really don't like the distraction that's been around this.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.960]   Plus, I'm just very disturbed to see the way people have reacted to somebody's health
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   problem.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   They've all grown so callous.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.280]   And I think particularly the younger generation that, you know, they don't actually have to
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   talk to anybody.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   They just text them.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.520]   It's when you're not looking somebody in the eye talking about death, it's a little
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   bit easier.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.920]   That's a good point, isn't it?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   You know, to say these things.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.560]   But when you have to face somebody and look at the look on their face when you tell them
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.160]   their love went sick or watch their reactions, they tell you, I think as an older guy, I'm
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.920]   glad I had those experiences because if my only exposure to death would be, you know,
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.480]   through a text or an email, then it is easy to get callous.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   You get detached.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   You do.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.880]   We're going to come back with our picks in just a little bit.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.600]   Any other stories that we need to talk about?
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.840]   I think there might be a few.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.880]   For instance, the Palm pre that we may have a date, a release date, which will be a shocker.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:50.320]   Would you, if you were Palm, would you want to release the pre before Apple's iPhone,
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.560]   which we think might come out in June or after Apple's iPhone?
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.920]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.440]   But before I do that, I want to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.160]   This is the place to put your website.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   Yes.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.120]   I love, I just want to say I love Squarespace.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.000]   This is an unsolicited testimony.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.720]   So we have a, we are moving stuff over now.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.280]   So we have got Twiplog up.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.680]   This is the new support site for this week in photography.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:24.000]   And it's twiplog.com.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.480]   And so I have actually been doing hands on playing around with it.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.800]   So this is a Squarespace site.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   This is a Squarespace site.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   And I've been doing-
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.080]   Do you not look like this 30 minutes from now if Alex is continuing?
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   Yes.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   Exactly.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   Well, that's the beauty of Squarespace.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   It's incredible.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   It's very easy to do.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.480]   So Aaron had been doing, Aaron, our producer, Aaron Mayler, who's brilliant and can do all
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   the coding.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.840]   And him kind of set it all up and get it all working.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.400]   But then there was some stuff I wanted to play with.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.360]   And I went in to change one color.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.280]   And then suddenly I was just, I'm moving stuff around.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.400]   And what's incredible is, is that it's all Wizziwig.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.240]   And when you're logged in as the administrator, I have these little buttons at the top.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.400]   And all I do is go, oh, I hit the paintbrush and I can change the width of the-
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   With a slider.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.720]   I can change the width of the text of all the stuff.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.200]   I can just simply move, just-
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.320]   You just move around what widgets are there and what they look like.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.880]   And I can change all the text.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.640]   And what happens, what you end up doing, which is just incredible, is you're working and
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.040]   you get to a page that you don't like.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   And you know what you do?
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.800]   You just click the little button and you fix it.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.440]   And then you go, and then you go, and you hit save and boom, it's changed.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.800]   And it's kind of neat to work Wizziwig in the website itself.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.960]   Yeah, you're in the website.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   Now it's a little dangerous because-
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.840]   But, you know, I mean, you're changing the way of your Alex Lindsay.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.720]   But you can also, you know, you can, Aaron did suggest he goes, you know, you could,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.280]   just build another template and then work off the template and then come back to it.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:55.480]   But it has been, I just can't believe how much, I played with this a year ago and it
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   was good.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   These guys are good programmers and they've really put their heart and soul into it.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.360]   And it's just a, oh my goodness, it makes me want to, you know, I'm working on my own
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.040]   blog that's going to come out soon.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.120]   And now I'm, now I want to, I kind of turned a corner up with Squarespace over the weekend
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.880]   when I was playing with this and Aaron and I spent about an hour on Skype just sitting
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.480]   there just talking and moving stuff around and it was so-
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.080]   That's probably a little too isn't it?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   It's fluid.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   And it's just, it's fantastic.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.520]   I am not, I am not going to build any other blog until these guys go under, which I don't
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.360]   think will ever happen or won't happen in our lifetime.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.600]   I don't know if I can help it.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Yeah, it could have been a sticker.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.840]   I mean, these guys, these guys, and the great thing is, is that you can export it out if
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.040]   you didn't like, if you decided something went bad.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.920]   I don't, I can't imagine ever building this in anything else.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.320]   I don't really, I don't want to know anything about that back end area, but it keeps you
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   structured.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.560]   They do some interesting stuff in the back end too.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.400]   They're using this Java and these virtual machines and the scaling of it is really slick.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   It's really neat stuff.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.680]   Well, and the big thing is, is that it doesn't, if, if for whatever reason, it keeps you structured
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.960]   enough, this is the difference between this and like Iweb or, or do another thing.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.880]   It keeps you structured enough that if you wanted to export this to WordPress, you could
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   export it to WordPress.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   You don't, you're not, you're not committing to it permanently, but the, the solution is,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.560]   it was much, much better than I expected.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   Just incredible.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   Sorry.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   I, I just had to go off.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.640]   Yeah, I don't really have to do the commercial now.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.280]   Well, I guess all I really have to say is you could try it free for two weeks.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.720]   As Alex said, very easy to import and export your blog.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   So you're never locked in.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.840]   And that means WordPress, moveable type, blogger, type pad, complete data portability.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.240]   Just for blogs, though, there's a forum.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.720]   I know I'm, you're using the photo gallery for Twip Photo, form builder, Google Maps.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.640]   I'm integrating the discuss, a commenting system into mine.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.720]   It's all as easy as possible to drag and drop Ajax interface.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.360]   Very powerful engine behind it.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.560]   And you can try it free for two weeks.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.440]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.560]   And if you decide to stick around 10% off when you use the coupon code Macbreak.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.480]   So just remember that squarespace.com/acapad.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.000]   Macbreak, we thank them for their support.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.160]   I got to get more sponsors at Alex loves.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.720]   I won't have to do any work anymore.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   That's pretty good.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.800]   I just happened to have a really great weekend working with it.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.840]   No, I've been blown away, you know, because it's funny until they can't until they talk
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   to us about advertising.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.200]   I admit I'd never heard of them.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   And boy, that blew me away when I started playing with it.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.200]   When I just find myself in and as Scott was pointing out earlier is now that I've turned
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.520]   this corner, I'll sit in the airport and I was like, oh, just noodle with the text
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.520]   color.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.320]   And just tweak little things that bother me.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.360]   And that's the thing that drives me crazy about web development in general.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.160]   And I'm looking at moving our commercial site, like DV Garage and everything else over to
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.240]   squarespace just because I have to figure out how to link in the ecommerce, but you
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.480]   can inject code into the pages.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.760]   But it's just like, oh, I just love the fact that there's something I don't like.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.320]   I don't have to call or email anyone to get them to fix it.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.680]   I just want to say that when we started building the first blog for this week in Vitarify,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.320]   Alex said something to me as a quote along the lines of, well, whatever you do, don't
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   let me get near with it because because if I do it, I'll never be finished.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.320]   Well, I've looked at the trip blog blog 10 times in the last two days and I've seen
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.600]   10 different colors, 10 different formats, 10 different type of.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.040]   Well, it's in beta right now.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   We've told our listeners it's in beta right now.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.320]   It's in beta forever now.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.520]   But it is cool.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.520]   It's very cool.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.320]   I've always been impressed with their approach.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.800]   And it's unlike any, it's none like Tai Pad.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.000]   It's unlike WordPress.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.080]   It's unlike any of them in the way that it's whiskey wig construction.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   It's very interesting.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.200]   All righty.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   So if you were, thank you, Squarespace, for your support, by the way.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   You get it.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.960]   We love you.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:55.160]   If you were palm and you had the choice of putting out the pre after iPhone 3, which
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.480]   we, I think we, first of all, do we all agree June, probably a WWDC iPhone 3?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   I mean, that's pretty obvious.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   And the question is whether it's the, it's yeah, I think so.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   Okay.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.840]   Could be earlier because I just bought my kids iPhones.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.920]   So I could, I could be a Scotts point, which is well taken is that in June, the people
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.000]   who bought the first generation iPhone will have their contracts will be expiring.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.640]   So it's got to have to be before.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   What was it June?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   29th.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   29th.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   I have a t-shirt somewhere.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   I got to show you this.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   Somebody brought me a t-shirt.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.560]   You're going to be jealous.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.800]   I still, I, you know, one of the things that I still think that, you know, now we're starting
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.000]   to see more and more rumors of this, something larger than an iPhone, but smaller than a MacBook.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.040]   That was in the Wall Street Journal article as well.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.280]   So I still, I think we are, I think we're still going to see something larger as well.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   It could be an addition to the iPhone.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.080]   I think we're going to see some kind of tablet.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   They're going to do it.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   They've got to do a 3G iPhone.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.200]   I mean, why else release the SDK and all that stuff?
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   A 3G iPhone.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.000]   Yeah, I mean, the 3G, not 3G is very quite rich.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   3.0 iPhone.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Right.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.320]   I think if Palm Smart, they'll release the pre the same day.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   Same day.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.880]   No, not the same day.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.080]   If they're smart, they'll release it the week before.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.400]   If they release it the same day, they'll get like about 10.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.840]   If you, if you want to figure out the best day to release something like that, think about
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.400]   the news producer who has two and a half minutes to fill.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.160]   If you release it the same day as the iPhone, then they have 10 seconds at the very, very
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.920]   end of the, of the new, of the items.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.560]   Oh, and in related news, this is what happened.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   If you do it like three or four days beforehand, the iPhone 3.0 story is definitely on his mind.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.440]   He definitely wants to do something that'll get the good people to tune back in in two
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.280]   days when they cover news about that thing.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.520]   So basically Palm can basically tap into the willingness to start covering smartphone
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.320]   developments and to lead up basically, basically to be the opening act to the Apple to the
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   Apple iPhone.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.520]   I mean, they don't have to, they don't have to take the whole world by fire, especially
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.760]   not with the version 1.0 of the pre.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.800]   All they have to do is get people's attention and you have them come back in a couple of
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.320]   weeks to double check on what they've got.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.880]   You get people's attention when people's attention can be bought.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.720]   And I don't think you can buy people's attention on the day of the iPhone release.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   The rumor is if you get 10 seconds, if you get 10 seconds at the end of the iPhone announcement
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.640]   with the pre, I bet you get on more stations than you get period covering.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.320]   I mean, otherwise, I think you got a decent handy, but I don't think you'll see the number
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   of stations cover the pre.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.440]   You're also basically the first thing that gets cut as soon as the guy from the remote,
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:25.760]   the guy from the remote is talking to people at the Apple store and the person with the
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   really cool Apple tattoos takes five seconds too long.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.400]   The first command from the booth is OK, dump the pre and go right into the keys for the
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   sushi place.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.360]   Well, what I thought was interesting is we were in an AT&T store.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.320]   The easiest, we actually went to the Apple store to buy iPhones and they sent me to the
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.120]   AT&T store because I wanted to do a family plan and they were like, oh, we don't really
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.680]   have the way to do a family plan here, you know, to add your kids to the family plan.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.920]   So I bought because I was buying my kids two iPhones.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   That's right.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   I had to go home and do the family plan.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920]   So it was just easier.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   It was just easier.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   They just had it just easier to go to the.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:04.120]   So we went to this AT&T store and while they were setting it up, all you can see is
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:10.160]   all these promos to sell smartphones other than the iPhone, you know, at the AT&T store.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.280]   There's just these little handouts of how much you can save and all these things you
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.480]   can get and I asked the woman who was handling it.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.560]   So which, you know, you have all these promos, which phone is really selling the most at
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   the AT&T store?
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   She looked at me and she's like, what do you think?
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   She's like the iPhone.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.920]   She's like, they're trying to even it out.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   It's not even close.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   Yes.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.080]   She said it was two to one to get against all of the other ones.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.680]   So the rumor and I, you know, I got to take this with a grain of salt.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:42.320]   It's just the rumor is that May 17th, pommel announced the pre, which is a lot earlier
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.480]   than Apple, presumably a month earlier than Apple.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.560]   I think that's probably smart.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.720]   If you, okay, if you think you've got a winner, you want to give it enough time for people
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.240]   to discover that it's a winner.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   Right.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.520]   The reviews to come out, you got to allow a couple of weeks.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.560]   I think the sooner you get that out, the better, right?
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.200]   But don't you have to, you have to hit almost a home run at this point to be considered
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   a winner against this.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.680]   They, I think pommel thinks they have a home run.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.440]   Well, what else are you going to think?
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.680]   If you don't have a home run, it's your dad.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   Don't you think?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:17.520]   No, I mean, what, the Mac is in a home run in terms of commercial appeal and yet it can
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.640]   do very, very well with the eight or nine percent of the market.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.400]   Pre doesn't have to beat the entire smartphone market.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   They don't have to beat the iPhone.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.720]   They don't have to beat the BlackBerry.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.640]   All they have to do is establish their credibility and that they have a platform that's going
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.480]   to last at least two more years.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.600]   I think that their goal for this launch should be to get people to think twice about switching
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.840]   to an iPhone or switching to a BlackBerry.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.240]   So long as they are part of the decision matrix, they get a win.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   Okay.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.160]   So in that case, you say announced a week before?
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.000]   I say announced a week or two before when everybody knows that the new iPhone is coming
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.960]   out, when everybody, when new phones are definitely on people's mind, when you have
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.880]   enough air between yourself and the iPhone announcement that you can get people to really
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.720]   take in that information, that we have something radical and new that does things better than
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.240]   the iPhone does.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.320]   And I know how excited you are about this new, about Apple's new phone, but give it a few
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.440]   weeks, read the reviews, wait until some of the software is in the field.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.880]   And again, consider the entire product matrix before you jump in and jump in line two days
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.960]   beforehand to be one of the first to buy iPhone 3.0.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.360]   You have the experience of being a reviewer.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:35.240]   How long do you need to have that phone before you can give your review of it?
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.800]   My first reactions are usually the most important ones.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.880]   And I can tell within 20 minutes whether or not we're on to something.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:51.240]   What I always says that to is I got a look at the package.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.080]   I don't want to claim that I'm more exhaustive than Mr. Dvorak, but I do tend to open the
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.640]   package.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:03.360]   But I like to, in terms of phone, I like to be using it as my real phone for a full week
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.200]   before I can come to any conclusions.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.960]   But I think so, you guys, and I'm sure most of the listeners have this, this spidey sense
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.720]   sort of reaction to certain technology where the first time I used to Macintosh, no kidding,
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.760]   the hairs, the backline, X stood up because it was so new and so different, but so holistically
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.920]   correct.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   The iPhone was another device like that.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.040]   There were all kinds of things that not made by Apple that also have that thing where,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.000]   ooh, this is a missing piece.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.400]   I had a hole in my soul exactly the shape and size of this device, and now I am completely
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   praised.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   Well, we know that that's the case with Scott Bourne.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.720]   He has, he had a very public hole in his soul.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.200]   He was begging for this thing.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.320]   So yeah, I still am.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.960]   I'm very happy with the iPhone and I've tried a few other phones.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.000]   In fact, that, you know, I've the there's been some people send me their phones hoping
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.960]   that they could get my attention.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.200]   I always sent back.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.720]   So I can't even make this thing turn on.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.520]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.840]   Be sure, bless my phone.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.520]   So, you know, I have to say that with the iPhone, I was amazed that, you know, it took
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.440]   me a little bit of time to figure it out.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.120]   My kids absorbed pretty much the entire phone, you know, every little feature of it within
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   about 60 minutes.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.560]   Yeah, and I showed it to my wife and she still can't figure out how to dial.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.600]   So it's, I mean, it's just depends.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   It's not, it's not on the way back from the mall.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.360]   They had stopped, I decided I don't know if this was such a good idea because on the
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.000]   way back from the mall, they're sitting there in the back seats, text messaging each other.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.800]   You got trouble.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   You got some trouble there.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.200]   They're not talking to me.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   You got a problem.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.400]   I don't think there's any perfect cell phone ever.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.000]   I mean, everybody's got to find something that works for them.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.320]   There are people that love the blackberry and there are people that hate it.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.120]   I mean, I just having had some personally pretty bad experiences with the Palm phones.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120]   I don't know.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.520]   I'm very dubious about the pre, but I always hope everybody survives because like I say,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.880]   that creates more competition.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.840]   But I'm not going to, I'm not going to run down and buy me a pre.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.480]   Andy, when would you, so you want to review the pre, you want to have a pretty good idea
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   of it.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.920]   You probably want to get a review published in the Sun times and you want to do that all
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.480]   before Apple announces its third generation iPhone.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.640]   When would you want it?
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.800]   I think May 17th is probably about right.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.840]   You could, you could, you could do a little later.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.840]   But not much later.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.200]   I mean, if I have the pre in my hands like in mid May, no matter when I get it, I'm going
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.840]   to have a review in play about a week later.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:38.440]   And that gives me, that gives me an excellent chance to speak as a very, as a very commercially
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   minded sort of guy.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.280]   So how am I going to set up my editorial calendar?
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.880]   Not only does this serve the needs of the readers because I definitely want to review
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.920]   this phone, but also allows me to sort of get people to come back for the iPhone review
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.320]   that I know is going to be coming up in a couple of weeks.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.480]   I think that's exactly the right time to do it.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.240]   And it'll be very interesting.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.680]   The reason that people think it's the 17th sprint, it's the same stuff we used to, we
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.240]   saw when iPhone release sprint employees have been told not to take a vacation in May.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.280]   I mean, there's all these, you know, there's all these hints that we saw before.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   It would be a jump.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.120]   I mean, they said that they were going to release the pre before the in the first half
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   of the year.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120]   So they have till June 30th.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.160]   So it would be a, it would be a little bit of a leap six weeks or I wouldn't.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.520]   I have to say though, I would be expecting them to start really priming the pump beforehand
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.600]   because I don't think that they've yet to really make that emphatic case of why the
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.920]   pre needs to exist.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.800]   I want to see really full feature demo videos.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.880]   We've seen some more stuff on its capabilities and its attitudes.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.360]   We've seen some developer information come out, but we haven't seen that video that
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.240]   says here is exactly why we're not telling you go out and buy one day and release.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.080]   We would love if that if you did that, but we're trying to make commitments to you that
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.400]   at least you see, go to the store and see both of these side by side before you make
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   a decision.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.200]   Right now, all we know about it is that it watches applications a little bit better.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.820]   It might be a little bit easier to write software for it, but they haven't made that emphatic
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.080]   statement of why this thing needs to exist yet.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   Right.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.160]   Well, I think that one of the challenges they're going to have is that if they, if you release
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.880]   in the middle of May, a lot of people looking for smartphones will that are, you know, in
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   the know will want to wait and at least see what Apple does in June.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   Oh, that's a risk.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   You're right.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.160]   You're going to hold out to see what's happening.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.600]   And if Apple, and if you do it afterwards, an Apple hit a home run.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   If they add a bunch of sales at all, there's nothing, you know, it's just, you know, they
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.640]   would be much better off three months away from an announcement or two months away from
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.600]   an announcement than right next to an Apple announcement, in my opinion.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.400]   I can solve this whole problem right now.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.480]   Let me just ask you a question.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:40.600]   If you had to feed your kids based on a, on working on a cell phone, you had a choice between
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.280]   being put on the iPhone team and the Palm pre-team, which one would you pick?
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.720]   Of course, you know, the iPhone's a proven commodity.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.000]   You know what the iPhone is and you know what it works.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.480]   You know what it's going to do.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.680]   But you could, if you were the first person to release a FART application for the pre,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.320]   you're in there from the pro.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   Yeah, developers are going to leap on an unexploited market right now.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   You know, so was the zoo.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.680]   It's first fart in the first part.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.360]   Three years later, the zoo still in an unexploited market, certainly unexploited by Microsoft.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.920]   Did you see the rumors of the zoo in HD?
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   That's sad to say.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   Oh, you know what?
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   That's it.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.600]   That's all we need with the zoo.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.160]   Make it bigger so it's harder to hide what you bought.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.880]   Some guy in rent sitting there going, that's it.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.880]   HD.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.800]   That'll solve everything.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.360]   That's it.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   Okay, you guys, you guys.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   How about, how about the Android phone?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   We're hearing some rumors.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.920]   There's going to be a new operating system cupcake do out any day now.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.880]   That thing was a real big thing.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   Is it growing on you yet?
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   Huh?
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.880]   No, it's grown off me.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.800]   If you had to pick an on or off, I'd say off.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   But I keep waiting.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   I keep wondering.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.880]   I mean, there's new apps coming out all the time.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.720]   There's very cool stuff on here.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.960]   Well, you shouldn't be about to review anything the first two weeks you own it.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   Why?
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.680]   Because it takes me a while to not like it.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.240]   Yeah, because you like everything for two weeks.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   That's probably true.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   And then you start.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   That's probably true.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   I listen to you.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   I don't have that.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   And I'll have that Andy and not co.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.320]   I can tell in 20 minutes thing.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.480]   I know what you're talking about, Andy.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.000]   I have that gut feel that you go, yeah, this is great.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.920]   But I have it maybe a little more often than I ought to.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.880]   And mind you, sometimes I get sadly, sadly disappointed as I start using it.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.640]   But again, that's why I'll make sure that I need a week of actual immersion therapy
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.080]   before I really commit to something.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.960]   But I mean, I'm still excited about Google, Google Android.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.360]   It is, I think that there needs to be a definitive business phone.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.880]   I think there needs to be a definitive media phone.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.160]   And I think there needs to be a definitive phone in which the maximum amount of power
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.280]   is in the hands of the developers and the users.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.240]   And I think that the Android phone right now is that third phone.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.240]   I agree.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.960]   And it has them in terms of buying a handset today that will be able to do even more awesome
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.840]   things a year from now that it's doing right now.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.600]   There's the iPhone and then there's the Android phone.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   So I don't.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   It's one of those.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.760]   It's one of those handsets where it doesn't matter so much to me that the software that's
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   there for it right now isn't the best that I can possibly imagine that software being.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.040]   Because I can easily imagine a year from now, the sort of software coming out for this that
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:18.320]   no one at Apple ever imagined and no one at Apple would ever approve for the App Store.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   That's true.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.520]   Although, you know, I recently cracked my iPhone just to see what was out there.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.560]   You just see what's in there.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.960]   You just whacked it against the crack.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.320]   Yeah, I cracked it and there's nothing inside.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.000]   It's just a lot of electronics.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.640]   I thought there was a little guy in there.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.160]   Alex told me there'd be a mouse with a paintbrush.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   Yeah, pretty bad.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.560]   I think that's an escape when I cracked it open.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.880]   Here, mousey, mousey.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.000]   If you do jailbreak your iPhone, there is a very funny program.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.600]   My son immediately downloaded it.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.920]   You touch the phone and it criss-screen cracks and it's very realistic looking.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.520]   He uses it to baffle his friends and amazes enemies.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.680]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.960]   Come back and talk about our picks of the week.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:00.080]   I might talk a little bit about jailbreaking it and I'll show you why I jailbroken.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.200]   But first it's time to talk about our friends at audible.com.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   We love Audible.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.600]   You know Audible is the greatest.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.480]   They do those great books you download.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   I want to call them e-books.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   They're really audiobooks.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:17.040]   But you download them, you listen to them, you get them so quickly.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.600]   I am such a fan of Audible.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.400]   Right now they're having a half price sale this week only.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.640]   Half price on 1000 plus unabridged titles.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.200]   These are the kinds of things that make Audible constantly of interest.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.720]   You really want to check out audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.480]   You can sign up right now for a gold account.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.880]   You'll get a book a month.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:45.120]   We like to help you by making some recommendations for books that you might want to listen to.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.440]   Alex, you're looking at me like you took Audible to London with you.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.040]   I did not take Audible to the Spartans.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.200]   I didn't listen to the Spartans.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.160]   In fact, I tried to get my...
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.680]   The main reason that I actually got iPods from my parents is that they're huge audiobook
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   listeners.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.920]   I'm about to do this for my mom too.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.320]   I think she would love it.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.160]   Now they went crazy for the music as well.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.640]   But the main reason I got it was because they listened.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.800]   They have a 40-minute drive.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.960]   My dad's got a 40-minute drive to and from work.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.400]   He just devours audiobooks.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.840]   The reason that I actually got the iPod form was simply explaining to him, "You can fit
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.960]   every book you have ever listened to on audio, to this little device."
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.200]   Rather than carrying around CDs and everything else.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.960]   I actually did suggest the Spartans.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.240]   He said, "No, I want to download the first book that I would actually listen to."
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   There you go.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.280]   Andy, do you have a tip for mom and dad, the Lindsay's?
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.240]   Anything they should listen to?
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.640]   Oh, for mom and dad?
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.760]   No, I have it for you.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.440]   I don't want to make it too hard.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   You're fine.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   We'll accept anything you want.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.160]   Do you have a pick, I guess is what I should have said.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.040]   I do indeed have a pick.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.600]   Actually it's sort of a double pick.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.800]   I want to give credit where credit is due.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:15.560]   I had no idea that Robert McKee's famous/classic/notorious book on story structure for screenwriting
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.160]   called Story was available read by Mr. McKee as an audible audiobook.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   You're kidding.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.320]   It is indeed.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.160]   Let's get back to that in just a second.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.480]   Credit where credit is due.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:31.000]   I found out about it by one of my absolute utter favorite podcasts of Creative Screen
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.640]   Writing magazine does a regular podcast in which they have huge events in LA where they
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.280]   screen a recent movie and then they spend anywhere from an hour to two hours interviewing
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.400]   the screenwriter on stage, not only about the process of writing this screenplay, but
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.880]   also the process of screenwriting in general and how they broke in.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   That's cool.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   Absolutely beg you.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.240]   Go to the iTunes store.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.400]   Look for Creative Screen Writing magazine podcast.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:03.440]   Immediately download the podcast with the writer of Wally and download the podcast about the
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.080]   writer of Valkyrie.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.200]   Those are the two absolute top ones.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.120]   They will make you into immediately.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.920]   They will make you click the Get All button about 10 minutes into either one of those.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   They're just absolutely wonderful.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.360]   I'm a fan of the...
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.320]   I listened to all the DVD extras stuff.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.040]   It sounds like it's kind of like that.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.360]   I love hearing how people make movies.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:31.160]   It's like I imagine the way that I keep recommending it to people is imagine James Lipton from
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:37.280]   the inside the actor studio, imagine a interview like that only the guy wasn't an obsequious
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.280]   idiot.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.240]   Try to throw a son.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:49.360]   It's not about James Lipton being honored to be on the same stage as the writer of...
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.440]   People who called the character of Paul Blart out of imagination and into America's screen
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.760]   writers, please join me in welcoming them.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.920]   The interviewer is the editor in chief of the magazine and he just knows how to tease
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.760]   the right stories out of people.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.400]   I'm using incredible amount of self-control by not trying to quote the podcast because
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.440]   there's so many great stories that come out of this that I could just keep talking for
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   hours.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.880]   Which is unnecessary because you can actually go and download these things for free.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.960]   And they recommended this Robert McKee book.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   They actually mentioned...
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.320]   I think actually Audible might be one of their sponsors too.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   So they're actually mentioning story as being available, which I did not know was available.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   Also...
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.200]   I'm not the sort of...
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.880]   I have to admit that I have never...
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.920]   Of all the content that Audible has, I've never downloaded any sort of an instructional
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.000]   or how-to book or anything that's supposed to uplift my life in any way other than being
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.320]   entertaining and good read.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.520]   And story is a really good title.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.240]   I did buy a copy a number of years ago when I started getting into fiction.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.880]   It's a fascinating book for a lot of reasons.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:57:00.200]   It's often lambasted as being the reason why movies are crap these days.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:07.880]   Because too many screenwriters do go to attend his story seminars and treat him like a guru
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   as he's going to teach me exactly how every script needs to be written.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   And that's not what...
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.560]   After reading the book, that's kind of what I felt after hearing this, depending on so
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   many people.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:20.520]   But after reading the book, I know that he's not teaching you how you must structure a
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.520]   story.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.080]   It's basically...
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.360]   Take a look at a stick of the concept of the story as a mechanical thing, like as a suspension
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.920]   bridge that can be very, very, very beautiful, but also has to function.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.720]   And there are reasons why it functions and reasons why it's going to fail.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.840]   Just like anyone can come up with the idea of, "Okay, there is this Northern Africans
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:44.360]   town in the middle of... before World War II, and it's occupied by the Nazis."
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:49.400]   And next Patriot American operates a bar there, and his old girlfriend turns up.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.560]   And she's there with a French resistance fighter, and he has to decide whether he's going to
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.280]   help these two escape or take away the girl or what.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.160]   And that's easy to come up with, but you have to decide, "Okay, well, what's the story
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   about?
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   Is it about the bar owner?
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.160]   Is it about the resistance fighter?
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.720]   Is it going to be about their attempt to get out of Casablanca?
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.920]   Is it going to be about some guy from the United States State Department who hears of this
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.560]   problem and tries to fly in and address the situation?"
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.400]   And when you read through the book, and you treat it as just an exploration of why certain
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.560]   stories work and why they don't, and also accept that he's not giving a pronouncement,
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.920]   but he's simply saying, "Here's what I believe about story, and here's my perspective."
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.400]   It really does get you thinking.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.240]   It's a good book in that even when you think that he's wrong, it helps you understand why
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.360]   you think certain things are right.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.720]   So I thought it was a way, I downloaded it a few weeks ago after hearing it mentioned
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.920]   on the Creative Screen Running Podcast, really enjoyed it.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.560]   I actually think I enjoyed it more than reading the actual book itself because I was more
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.360]   in a listening mode than a, "Oh, come on.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.280]   You don't have to do it that way."
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   And then realizing that, "Okay, well, he's just offering opinions."
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.920]   Well, it'd be like going to one of his seminars.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.440]   I mean, that's kind of cool.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   Right.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.960]   And normally, it's like a 30-hour, three-day seminar that he does.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   And if you go to his website, there's just a huge list as long as your arm and four other
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.800]   arms besides of famous names that have taken the course.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.400]   It seems like it's like high school for screenwriters in that you don't necessarily feel as though
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.440]   it's the formative experience of your life, but it seems to be a step that almost everybody
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.400]   feels as though they need to go through.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.000]   In any event, it's a good read, interesting thoughts.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.080]   Even if you're not interested in writing fiction, it'll help you understand, again, the mechanics
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.440]   of how stories work and why certain stories fail.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   It's very, very interesting read.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.160]   I added that to my list right now.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.240]   Story, substance structure style and the principles of screenwriting.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.600]   Robert McKee writes and reads it.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.800]   And that could be your audible book.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.320]   You get it for free.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.960]   How many F-bombs does he drop during the reading of the audible book, Andy?
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.640]   Is he famous for swearing?
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.080]   Oh, he can say more in six seconds than I've said in my life.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.360]   My ears were melting there.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.320]   My ears were not exactly melting off inside the car.
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   I think that...
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   Okay.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.000]   Do you take it, Robert McKee's seminars?
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.840]   I have several friends who've been there and I have the CD in the book and I use his
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.200]   information, not as a screenwriter, but as a photographer.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.360]   I like to tell stories and I try to adapt all storytellers information.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]   He's a famous one.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.080]   That book is world famous, but this guy is...
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.160]   He uses the Socratic method of teaching and his seminars, basically you try to survive
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.160]   them without being screamed at, called out, made fun of, thrown out.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:38.240]   If you ever saw the movie adaptation with the Lewis Cage, he's parodied in that movie.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.640]   Yeah, anyway, but I think it's a...
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.880]   If you're at all interested as Andy said, if you're at all interested in any aspect of
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.680]   writing, you just need to read this book.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   If they got an honorable, that's a great way to get it, because this guy is very colorful,
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.360]   very opinionated, very strong opinions, very good delivery.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.520]   I just wondered if they edited him.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.800]   Well, it is a bridge.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   Maybe that's what they abridged.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.920]   They took out all the F-bombs and it was an hour shorter, I don't know.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.800]   It was 70 hours long now.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.680]   Our Audible recommendation, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.760]   We thank him so much for their support for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760]   Did you see this?
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.040]   I'm going to play this.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.160]   This is somebody sent me this.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.760]   I don't even know if there's F-bombs in this or not, but I thought it'd be funny.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.320]   It's a parody of the new Microsoft ads.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:36.240]   I thought that the folks here might enjoy this from landlinetv.com.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.400]   This is Frank.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.880]   He told us he wanted a laptop with for under $1000.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.560]   We told him, "You find it, you keep it."
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.960]   We're excited to get a laptop.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   Hopefully I get a good one.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:55.320]   Homeless, so I don't have much experience with computers.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   These are beautiful MacBook Air.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.960]   That's actually really nice.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   It's so thin!
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   $1700.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.560]   What can I get for $1000?
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.400]   Windows just a home premium.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   This is a...
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400]   This is plastic?
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.400]   I'm poor, but I'm not retarded.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   All right, these people are just...
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.040]   This whole line of motherboards, just second rate Korean components.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.680]   It's terrible antivirus software.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]   I don't want this.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.680]   Just give me the money.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.440]   What am I going to do with it?
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.440]   Congratulations, Frank.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.440]   It's a PC.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:38.400]   All right, I have to say, it's pretty apt.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.600]   I just thought a little interlude before our picks of the week.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.720]   So you might ask, "Why, Leah?
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.920]   Why did you jailbreak your iPhone?"
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.080]   Because really, I don't feel the need.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.000]   I haven't felt the need to jailbreak it for a long time.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.360]   I thought all these applications, these are great.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.840]   We'll take a look at my Mac screen right now.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.680]   You see that iPhone picture on there?
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.840]   That's a live view of my actual iPhone.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.760]   Let me just launch Evernote right here.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.600]   And there it is, launching on the screen.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   This my friends...
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   You know, that is...
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   You've been looking for it.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.200]   I actually have been...
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   Since I saw...
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.680]   What's the app that...
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.680]   Well, there's two.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.560]   I'm going to have a screen splitter, which you need to have a jailbroken iPhone to use.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.160]   And then demo God, which you run on your Mac.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   It allows you...
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.800]   So now you can actually see the screen too.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.240]   Wireless-ly, I could see the screen on my Mac screen and on my iPhone.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.960]   I could troll it from the iPhone, but I also can show you on a screen.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   The reason I needed this is I'm going to do a lecture on Mac, Manian 9, 60 iPhone apps
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.280]   in 60 minutes.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.880]   And I thought, "Well, I'm just going to have to do still shots."
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   Right.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   No, no.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   And that is what's so frustrating.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.520]   It's from day one, Apple, of course, has had an application that allows them to do this
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520]   through the hardware, through the...
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520]   Yeah, it had a connect to...
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.480]   That's what Steve uses when he's doing the thing.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.200]   They have it and they won't let anybody have it.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   Right.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   And it's insane.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.680]   And it actually is the one reason that I'm actually considering getting...
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   Cracking my iPhone specifically, because we want to do demos for Mac break and stuff like
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.680]   that.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.400]   And it would be huge for developers, everything.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.040]   I'm here to tell you this works great.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   So here's...
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   It's free.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.520]   You do have to jailbreak your iPhone.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.480]   I use the quick-pone method of jailbreaking my iPhone, which was an easy thing to do.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.520]   In fact, it all started because Henry said, "I want a hack, man."
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:34.440]   And I said, "Okay, Henry, you can hack, but first you have to learn Bash, Shell, and perhaps
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440]   a little JavaScript."
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.280]   And he said, "Is there an easier way?"
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.240]   I said, "Well, we could jailbreak your iPhone."
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.280]   He said, "Okay, let's try that."
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:48.480]   So as a father-son exercise, a little kind of turn him on to the principles of hacking,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.000]   and I hadn't done this in a while.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.280]   I jail broke and actually unlocked my first generation iPhone, but I hadn't felt the need
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.600]   since the App Store.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.560]   So I went out and I went to the internets and found...
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.920]   There are a couple of ways to do quick-pones very easy.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   You download it.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.000]   They have a Mac and Windows version.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.800]   The only trick is if you've already upgraded to Leopard, you actually have to downgrade the
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.600]   USB drivers, which you could do.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.760]   Apple offers them at Connect.apple.com.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.960]   You have to have a free developer account.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.280]   You download the old drivers, you put them on, then you can do the...
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.880]   It's all done automated in the software.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.440]   Very easy to jailbreak.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:35.280]   And then once you've done that, you can put the Cydia application on there that allows
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   you...
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   There's two.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.440]   There's Cydia and there's installer that allows you to find other applications.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.480]   And I have to say, it impacted the reliability.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.280]   I put winner board on and programs seem to crash a lot.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.480]   And I was kind of thinking, "Well, this doesn't really...
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.840]   I was thinking of going back, to be honest with you.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.040]   I didn't see anything really wild that I wanted."
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.760]   Even the tethering application didn't seem all that cool.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.360]   And then I found Screen Splitter and DemoGod.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   And I thought, "I know now why I have jailbroken my iPhone.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   This thing is..."
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   It works.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.600]   You're watching the live streaming video that we send out.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.560]   You're watching a direct representation of my iPhone on the Mac screen as I manipulate
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   it.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   It really works.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.320]   You'll vouch for that, right, Alex?
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.960]   Yes, it is.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   As said, it's the one big temptation.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   It's what you've been waiting for.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.400]   And I keep on going, "Ah, I don't want to bother downloading...
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.040]   I mean, cracking it and everything else."
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.880]   And I'm very seriously...
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   This one's worth it.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   And I'm going to keep it this way because I need to show...
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:44.840]   The lecture thing is that Apple should just allow people to either use their app or build
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.400]   something, allow developers to create something there.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.880]   This is the kind of thing you'll never see in the App Store, right?
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.640]   I mean, it's just the kind of thing they don't want to do.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.160]   Now, while I'm showing you that, I might as well show you.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160]   Why is it...
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   Why?
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   That's the question I have.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.080]   Why does an Apple allow you to...
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.800]   They don't want people doing this kind of stuff.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   ...doing video.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   No, I'm talking about cracking it.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.320]   I'm just talking about being able to see your screen while you're...
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   No.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Now, the frame rate...
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320]   I'm going to show you the frame rate real quickly.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.680]   By showing you another pick, because this is the game that I can't stop playing right
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   now.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.960]   It's called Flight Control, if you guys play this.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.200]   And by the way, let me rotate the phone on the screen so that you can see it.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.000]   That's another feature.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.480]   Flight Control lets you...
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480]   I'll just click the screen.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.880]   I can't click the screen.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.720]   It lets you be a...
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.920]   It's beautifully designed with a great deco feel.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.640]   Let's you be an air traffic control operator.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.840]   Here we have our little landing strip and I have to bring my jets, helicopters, and
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.000]   small planes in for landing, all without crashing them.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.120]   I haven't been able to do more than 36 successful landings without a horrendous in-air collision.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.600]   So maybe you can do better, but it sure is a lot of fun.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.840]   That's a free pro...
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:54.200]   No, I think it's 299 Flight Control, but the main recommendation, screen splitter and demo
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   are free.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   Whoa, whoa.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   Okay.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.200]   There you go.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   I'm going to tell you both.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Good luck.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   [laughter]
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.600]   I hope I can land.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.200]   Oh my goodness.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.360]   Annie and I go.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.800]   You're next, my friend.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:15.520]   Oh, I'm just reflecting on, you know, I remember days with my dad, you know, building
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.560]   his pint-wood dot derby racers or, you know, doing a little bit... doing your hard work
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.160]   together, playing catch.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   I don't think we ever decided to violate a Ula together, but...
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]   It's ticketed.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.920]   But then again, I guess we weren't as close as, you know, as you and your kid.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.600]   You probably should point that out, that Apple has decided to say that it is illegal
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.080]   to jailbreak your iPhone.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.080]   That's their opinion.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.720]   And I think you're off and on to think about waiting until your son is over a team before
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.320]   you violate any Ula.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   No.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   Come on.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.320]   Come on.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.760]   It's a great American sport, the violation of the Ula.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   [laughter]
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.600]   Remember, son, if you don't get caught, how wrong could it possibly have been?
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.360]   Do you think, really, do you think that I have been a bad father by showing him how
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   to do that?
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360]   No, no, no.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.600]   I think you're being a cool father.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.160]   I would use this as a gateway to just like a conversation about sex and drugs, a gateway
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.960]   to intellectual property discussion, which you should be having with your child before
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.680]   sending him off to live on his own college.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.440]   I don't let them use lime wire.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.000]   I give them an allowance on iTunes so they can buy music.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.480]   But I just feel like you're now worried about Leo's kid and answer this question.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.760]   What kind of father are you?
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.640]   I am a father who teaches his child that you bought the hardware.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.040]   You could do anything you'd darn well pleased with it.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.320]   The investigation was launched without authority today by a young man in Petaluma, California.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.680]   Hey, if he owned the space shuttle, he could launch it.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   [laughter]
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.280]   That's my position.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.680]   So can you launch the .001% of it that is tax payers to tax on space?
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.200]   Yeah, if you can get that part to go without the rest of it, more power to him.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.000]   Anyway, no, you've funny.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.080]   I don't see any ethical problem at all.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.320]   I don't care what Apple's lawyers say.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.320]   I think jailbreaking is completely...
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.320]   You're fighting your field?
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.560]   Well, but I think this points to the silliness that all of this has created is we've gotten
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.360]   to a point where we just don't care.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.520]   You know, like with my kids, my conversation, I have to admit around music was not the moral
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   implications.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.200]   It's that your mother will be very upset if you get caught, if we get a cease and desist,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.200]   you know, or a lot.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.600]   Your mother will be very upset.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.920]   You'll break your mother's heart with this season.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.520]   It's almost as bad as dating a bass player.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.160]   Just don't do it.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.520]   Wait until it's long gone.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.760]   I was like, you know, I would consider that a rite of passage, you're going to get a cease
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.640]   and desist letter, but your mother will be very upset.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.240]   I try to encourage them to buy the content.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.800]   I got my kids an allowance just so they can do that.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800]   That's why I do that.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.720]   But this I don't feel like is in the same.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.200]   But no, I think that's good input.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   Go ahead, Anilako.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:02.480]   Well, I also picked a Mac application, Vcockpit GPS, which is damn near next to useless, but
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.600]   also damn near the coolest thing that I have on my iPod.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:13.520]   It just gives you a really, really cool graphically intense simulation of an analog airplane cockpit
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.880]   of a cockpit control cluster.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.520]   So you get like the artificial horizon, you got air, you got air, you got your speed,
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.560]   acceleration, vertical speed, altitude, and you also have some digital controls and a
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.800]   digital compass.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:31.840]   And it's all like around indicators that are just screwed into like this metallic panel.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.960]   And what you do with it is that while you're like the passenger seat of a car, you just
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.840]   basically put your iPhone on the dashboard, you can pretend like you're flying an airplane
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   almost.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   That's what I want.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.200]   Because you're kind of bored.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.000]   You're just kind of like seeing with the dials, switch and move.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.240]   As you're kind of like leaning, as your driver is sort of leaning into it turns kind of fun
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.200]   to see like the artificial horizon, twist and go towards the left and you see exactly
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.960]   how many Gs you're pulling.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.280]   And also I gave a talk at the Colorado Macintosh, uses group last week while I was in town.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.920]   And they have their meetings at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.440]   And we're getting my ears are popping twice as the car is climbing up this hill.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.080]   I mean, Boulder, Colorado is already like a mile in altitude.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.840]   And I had to pull out this application to check out my actual altitude, going into 5,300,
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.280]   5,400, 5,500, finding out that yes, we're just shy of 6,000 feet in altitude by the
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.200]   time we got the car parked.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.920]   And again, it's a free version and a paid version.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:49.280]   It's the I did pay for the commercial version, chiefly because I like the heads up display
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.840]   the head up display feature of it.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.400]   I have a I do have a car dash mount that I usually have one listed in the audiobooks
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   and stuff like that.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.520]   I need to have something that I have like a five, maybe four, maybe 3% distraction level
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.760]   of thinking, you know what?
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.040]   I know I'm going 60 miles an hour, but the highway is completely straight.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.280]   There's absolutely no one on the road.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.000]   I will not have cause a problem if I spend three seconds glancing out to see if I got
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.320]   any new email and just I'm just 2% in my weaker moments, 3% that you know that I that occurs
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   to me.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.120]   But if I have that screen doing something useful, like again, telling me what my speed
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.080]   is, then it actually serves a purpose.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.600]   It's like, well, I can't I can't check my email.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.000]   I don't want to quit this application.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.560]   It's telling me that I'm doing 50 54.41 miles per hour.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.680]   That can go another, you know, 0.5, 59 miles per hour before I'm going to get the get the
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.680]   smoke.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   He's in in in play.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.800]   It's very cool.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.120]   What's it called again?
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.960]   It's called V cockpit.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.440]   They have a free version and a pay version and believe it or not, I just become aware of
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.000]   five minutes ago that they have a free version.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.520]   So I do not know.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.040]   It says that the for for three bucks in the full version, you get the heads up display
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:07.000]   version, which which means that it'll you can just toss the iPhone on your dashboard
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.440]   and it'll read everything in mirror image so that your your information will be floating
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.280]   on the right.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.320]   Reflect on your on your on your on your windshield.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   Right.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   Exactly.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.720]   So yeah, that's that's that's actually kind of a common feature to these dashboard applications.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.680]   It's actually technique that I've used for years, whenever I need to print out complicated
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.760]   directions, I will I have an actually actually an automated action that simply I type out
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.000]   the directions in any word processor, it prints them out in reverse in big block letters and
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.160]   then you simply put the piece of paper on the dashboard and floats the instructions above
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.360]   above right right above the hood of your car.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.520]   You are a little wizard.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.800]   I never thought of doing that.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   That's clever.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.800]   I am a little wizard.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.800]   Thank you.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.200]   Wow, Andy and I go.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.080]   But okay, so two cool features that are actually in the paid version that I'm looking at it,
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.240]   you can tap in the paid version.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.280]   You can tap on any one of these indicators and it'll go full screen.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.360]   So if you just want to see what your speed is, just want to keep track of one element,
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.040]   it'll do that just to have an artificial artificial compass and very, very cool.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.880]   If you tap on the if you if you've gone full screen and you tap on the display again, it'll
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.400]   actually produce a chart, a graph against time of what that has been reading.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.520]   So if you want to know what your speed has been over the past hour, it'll graph it for
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.920]   your or your acceleration or how much you've been backing and turning as you go.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.800]   So again, for free, it's definitely worth the money for $2.99.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.760]   It's still a good way to basically have your have your iPhone do something useful for you
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.680]   on the dashboard while you're just listening to an audiobook or podcast.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.320]   They wonder how it works in an actual plane.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.000]   No, you're really not supposed to do that.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.880]   It's not like you're using the you're not using the phone part.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   You're not to turn that well.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.400]   It's only a buck 99 by the way.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.880]   They just got out the price.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.920]   Yeah, DPS is a radio.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.360]   You're definitely not supposed to do that.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.280]   I could tell you that if hypothetically you were to turn it on inside an airplane on Saturday
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.520]   afternoon, at least you would get what seems to be a very credible, credible airspeed,
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.680]   very credible altitude, very credible.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:24.080]   Again, you're not really supposed to use it that way, but you actually have been enjoying
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.600]   it more on Amtrak because you don't really get a sense of how fast you're going, especially
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.840]   when you get to that when you're on the Xcela and you're on that straightaway.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.200]   And I've driven past Xcelas that basically it was a all I was aware of was a gust of wind
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.280]   and a flash of blue and then all was silent again.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:46.600]   So it's more fun to say, I'm driving the train.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.920]   I think there's I think there's almost no other formal transportation that I enjoy more
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   than the Xcela.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   I like in the United States.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920]   I like in the US.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.200]   I think trains are great.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.760]   Yeah, I'm going to university of Pennsylvania tomorrow to give a talk and they offered a
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.560]   fly man said, Nope, put me on the train.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   Yeah, I can exactly.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.000]   I'll have a much better time.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.240]   I'll have like seven hours.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.200]   It happens to be a longer longer ride, but seven hours, which I can sit, relax, use my
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.560]   computer, use my phone.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.080]   I can have basically a full office day and arrive there, refreshed, relaxed and unproved
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.320]   by security.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.120]   Exactly.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.280]   And you said you're going to go somewhere to go?
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.720]   No, I just said, I've been on the trade ground.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.560]   We tie like the high speed train.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560]   Oh, the TV.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   The TV's out here in the West.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.360]   You know, we don't have trains, but I wish we did.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   I say what?
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.800]   How the hell did you get out there in the first place 100 years ago?
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.880]   Well, you know what I mean?
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880]   We don't have the kind of train.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.720]   We don't have an excel out here.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.720]   We don't have anything.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720]   We don't have it.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.760]   You know, our train system on the West part of the United States isn't as developed as
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.760]   the East.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.240]   Plus, it's a long ways between any two places out here.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.600]   It's like, you know, out there, everything is crammed together.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   It's not the same experience.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.120]   I've taken the train all the way from Seattle to San Diego.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   It was fun.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.400]   It's not the preferred mode of transportation out here, especially given the fact that you
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.320]   have to stop at every little town.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.160]   But I'll tell you, I'm trying to get to the San Diego Comic Con this year.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.480]   And last night I was, I took the first step towards convincing myself to take the train
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.040]   all the way across the country, get sleeper car accommodations, and basically just have
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.680]   a nice slow three day process of just taking pictures outside the window, napping in my
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.680]   own cabin.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.560]   Of course, I don't know if I want to spend money to have a roll in the hotel room.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.160]   That's what's kind of sad about it is it really is pretty pricey.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.160]   It's very expensive.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:39.200]   It's cheaper to buy first class full fare ticket on any airline that it is to buy the nice
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.240]   sleeping accommodations on the train.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.880]   I've done that when I was a kid.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.560]   We took the Zephyr from Chicago to Oakland.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.720]   It was an amazing trip.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   I'll never forget it.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.960]   I just feel like I like to do it once.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.280]   You should do it once.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.040]   And then I took the kids.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   I can't remember.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.080]   We did an overnight sleeper from somewhere to somewhere back East just a few years ago.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.160]   It wasn't as nice as it was.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.960]   It's not the same business anymore.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.320]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:10.400]   I know that the fastest train I've been on was the one from Tokyo to Nagano in Japan.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.600]   And it feels totally like you're not moving.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   Those are the bullet trains.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.400]   You don't feel like you're moving until you look outside and then you realize you're going
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400]   about 200 miles an hour.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   Holy cow.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.040]   So you need this application for that.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.240]   I'm looking forward to using it next time I'm in Tokyo.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.320]   So now he makes one called Jetcock, cockpit 2.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.760]   Is that a different?
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.360]   I think that's meant more.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.960]   I only have a cursor experience with it.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.520]   I believe it is for actual people who are aviating.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.840]   Although they do warn you do not use this as an actual navigation aid.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.080]   It's for entertainment purposes only.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.640]   Something that sort of bears out when you try to compare actual elevations and actual
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   horizons.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:51.360]   I would not want to have to like keep the plane on the non-crashy side of the horizon
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.920]   based solely on a free application I downloaded from the app store.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.600]   He lost connection with the GPS and crashed the airplane into the ocean.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.720]   When I was flying in Alaska this year, last year to go photograph the grizzly bears, our
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.120]   pilot picked this up in a 1954 bush plane and his soul.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:12.320]   And I mean soul instrument in the plane was a Garmin Nuvi.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.960]   Well, that's how Roz rode across the Pacific.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:21.040]   Her oceanic navigation rusted out, failed.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.200]   And she had a Tom Tom she'd thrown in from her truck and she used that and it worked
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   fine.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:31.120]   One of the things that I think is really interesting is as we start to see this third, you know,
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.400]   the version three of the software is how much I think people are going to rely on the iPhone
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.200]   and whatever the tablet might be as an interface.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:46.120]   You could basically give up developing the interface and of hardware applications by simply
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.120]   having it.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.320]   I think you're going to get to a point where you're going to have a car stereo that's just
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.720]   a lock in for your iPhone.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:55.120]   You just pop your iPhone into it and then you have whatever you're doing in the car and
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.600]   then you just pop it out and put it in your pocket.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.800]   And I think it's very interesting to see how this is all moving forward.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.440]   I mean, people think I'm joking when I say that I would love to see like universally
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.720]   the Bluetooth or dock connector for actual appliances like for my bread machine.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.280]   Instead of having LCD and two buttons, if I have an iPhone, the ability to say, no,
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.920]   here's a complex profile that I want you to download a specific type of bread that I
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:23.880]   want to make and we'll be able to very accurately navigate the temperature controls for duration
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.200]   and also basically ping me when it's when it's actually done.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.400]   I mean, you're spending a lot of money for this really cool interface and this really
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.360]   cool pocket Wi-Fi screen.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   Why just use it just for phone calls and movies?
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.760]   All right.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:41.400]   So your recommendation is the heads up display from the cockpit GPS.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.360]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, I turn you over to Mr. Scottborn.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.640]   Well, I got a good one.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.880]   If you got the Max Heist bundle this year, you got this.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.640]   And if you haven't looked at it, you really should.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.440]   It's called picturesque.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.240]   picturesque.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.680]   And it's part of the Mac Heist deal.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.280]   If you didn't get it on Mac Heist, it's 35 bucks and well worth it.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:05.200]   This is a fun little application.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.960]   You bring in your photographs or any image for that matter and you can click a button
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.440]   and you get one of those cool Apple reflections like you see in all the presentations or you
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:19.240]   can put perspective control on it or curves or strokes.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.840]   You can play with the background.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:26.440]   It's a nice way to make your image stand out if you want to have a very cool, high-end
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.440]   graphic approach.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:34.600]   If you're going to use that image in a brochure on a website in some sort of poster, it is
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.840]   really amazing.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   You can do cropping.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.480]   If you just need to do some basic stuff and you don't need Photoshop, you just want to
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.280]   make your images look pretty, being able to rotate the 3D perspective.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.400]   I mean, that was something you used to have to buy a high-end deal for.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.080]   It also is compatible with AutoAppleScript.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.080]   You can automate all kinds of batch processing with AppleScript if you know how to do that
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.360]   kind of stuff.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   It's only a 3 megabyte file.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.600]   It just works.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.720]   I'm just very impressed with it.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.320]   And I have the tools to do this stuff, you know, the high-end fancy way.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:12.720]   But ever since I've got it, I've been dropping photographs into it for a presentation.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.480]   I'm going to give a presentation later this year in New York.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.840]   And I thought, man, this would be nice.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.880]   And they all look like I hired some fancy pants designer to do them.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]   Very cool.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   picturesque is $35.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.080]   I didn't realize it was a student project.
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.080]   That's very cool.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:35.880]   And it looks like they made their whole website, you know, on .Mac.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   You could even do commerce.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.960]   It's a A-C-Q-U-A-I-L-I-A dot com slash picturesque.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.720]   They have other applications that look interesting too.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   Acqualia.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.600]   Speaking of interesting applications, we were talking earlier about the Android phone.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.000]   And I just wanted to point out that Stickam now has a viewer.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.240]   You know, you can watch us on Ustream on the iPhone, although we're not yet sending out
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.320]   a stream that's appropriate for that.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.400]   So it hesitates a lot.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:07.840]   But Stickam, which is also one of our streaming providers, has done it on the Gphone.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.320]   This is a G1 from Android.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.760]   This is free in the Android store.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.920]   And it's pretty cool.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.720]   You get the chatroom read-only and you get the video.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.560]   Now this is on doing this on Edge.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.360]   And it's actually working on it.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   Turn on the Wi-Fi here.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.200]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.480]   So that's free in the Android store if you have a G1 phone.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.920]   You can watch us live.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.480]   I think there are people watching and somebody said in our Stickam chatroom, I'm watching
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.280]   in class and nobody can believe I'm watching TV live.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280]   In class.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280]   In class.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.640]   There's a lot of other, you know, we're one of the feature shows, but there are a lot
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.720]   of feature shows in there.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.440]   It's really cool.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.280]   Now it's your turn, Alex Lindsey.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.480]   Well, the one thing that you can be guaranteed of is if there's going to be an expensive
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.720]   application on the iPhone.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.440]   Yeah, that's why, you know, I'm going to find it.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440]   That's what we have here.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.800]   How many Alex's is?
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.120]   It's not a bunch of Alex's.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.400]   But it is $20 for an iPhone app.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]   Okay.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.480]   And I, you know, I'd heard about it and I finally broke down and bought it.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.400]   And it is worth $20.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.400]   That's a lot.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.400]   It is a lot.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   It's funny.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   So it's all relative, isn't it?
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   Well, I mean, yeah, well, the fact that you're thinking about a $20 app.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   Oh my God.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.360]   That's a great algorithm to go out.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   But it is.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.000]   So this is a program called Beat Maker.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   Beat Maker.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   Beat Maker.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.920]   And it's 1999 and it is a I have to admit, I spent like two and a half hours in it on the
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.000]   plane last night.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.800]   And so what you have is a, this allows you to build, you know, build and sequence, you
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.520]   know, drum beats and bass things.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.160]   And I don't know what I'm going to use it for.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.400]   But, but I think so.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.920]   So here's a couple of the samples.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:45.920]   Hold on.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:50.120]   Of course, I broke it.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   Hold on.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   I might have, oh, I got to turn up the volume.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.560]   I had the volume turned down.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   And it sounds really good.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   Is he?
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560]   Can you hear that?
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:08.440]   I bet the people on the plane were really through.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.600]   And my headphones on.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.800]   I wasn't listening to it.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.080]   And by the way, it sounds, it sounds cute when it's on your iPhone.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.560]   You put the headphones in and they're really, really top samples.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.480]   Now you can also download samples.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   You can sample stuff.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.560]   You can plug this directly into it.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.080]   Does this require the new iPhone or this work on the old one?
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   I don't know.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   I don't know.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   I think it'll, you know, I'm not sure.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.360]   So can you hear that?
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.880]   I don't know if it's.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.600]   Turn it up a little.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600]   I think it's.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.600]   OK, here we go.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:49.400]   So now what's pretty good.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.320]   So what's cool though is that's just the same.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.840]   That's just the little pads, but you can go into a sequencer.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:59.040]   And I can go into the sequencer and I can set up a sequence and I can say, OK, I'm
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.240]   going to set this up to loop and then I can hit.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.840]   Let me check my sequence real quick here.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.560]   I'm going to set the.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:17.480]   OK, so now what I'm going to do is I have a loop and I can hit play.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.600]   And now it's going to be looping across.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.440]   Now I can start adding stuff so I can.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.960]   So I can.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.000]   So you can basically have these little things where you can turn these things on and off,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.560]   but I can go in here and.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.680]   And it would have a good job.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.040]   I'm talking and doing this at the same time, kind of off the.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.240]   Off the bars.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.240]   Anyway, so.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.920]   So but then you can go.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.120]   I can't suppose to be coming up right now.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.520]   I'm glad we saved this for the last thing.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   We do a little.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.520]   There.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   Oh, I love you.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   I'm going to kiss you tomorrow.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   So anyway, so.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   OK, enough.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520]   I know.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520]   You mock me.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.640]   So so I what's cool though is that is that you have all these pieces and these are things
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.560]   that you know you can you can really throw together.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.560]   I'm not doing it.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.760]   I didn't do a very good job of selling it on the the.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:23.640]   But you can put together some really complex, you know, mixes and you can.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.040]   It is amazing every time I think I've reached the point where I understand how the app works.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.000]   I've I realize there's like three more pains that I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   That's awesome.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.040]   Where you can add you can add sound effects to it.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:39.040]   You can you know, it's it's it's really cool.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.560]   So if you're in the music and you you know, especially if you're a I used to DJ in my younger
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.000]   years and just not I know I know I can say 20 years ago, which is very frightening.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   Oh, so.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   Oh, man.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.560]   So so I know that I would have lived on this thing, you know, as a way to glue songs together,
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.840]   you know, when I was back back then.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.560]   So anyway, it's nifty.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.560]   Check it out.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.160]   It's called Beat Maker and it's on the iTunes music.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:12.960]   It is a $19 and 99 cents worth of fun and games and annoying.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.520]   You know, and if you really did want to annoy the people in the seat next to you, you'd
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520]   leave it on.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.680]   Yeah, it'll not not have the headphones on.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.680]   It'd be a good choice.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.160]   So let's see, Alex, Scott, Andy and I have all done our picks.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.240]   I think we are finished here.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.440]   Our job here is done.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.280]   We have we have entertained you.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:34.800]   Don't forget you can listen to this automatically by subscribing it to it in iTunes.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.560]   Just go to iTunes search for Twit.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.160]   You'll find all of our shows there and you can watch us do it live.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:46.520]   We do the the taping live front of a live studio audience on the internet on the internet
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.240]   at live.twit.tv, but you can also watch on ustream.tv and stick him.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.080]   Now you can watch on the G one.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.720]   We're going to get the ustream iPhone version up as quickly as possible.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:03.480]   You can also listen live at Twit.am and all of that happens at 11am Pacific on Tuesdays,
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.560]   2pm Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   So hope you'll stop by.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.720]   Goes to coast across America on the Twit Network.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.160]   Yeah, around the world.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.600]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.520]   Almost 30% of our audience is outside the US.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.720]   So it really is a global operation.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.720]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.720]   We'll see you next week.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.520]   Another Mac break is hit the fan.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:45.280]   [Music]
