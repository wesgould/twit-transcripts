[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Hello.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hello Leo, how are you?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   It's a great day in San Francisco.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Oh, it's tremendous.

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Oh, I forgot you're in the avenues.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It's gray all the time.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Scott Bourne is a little more downtown.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   You've seen some sunshine out there in the --
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   whatever they call that district.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Well, the Dog Patch District is the location of
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Padango Studios and it's the officially sunniest
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   weather in San Francisco.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And today is sunny.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You're kidding, really?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Well, down here.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Wow, that's impressive.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   It's not sunny in Petaloom.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Well, it's not really sunny sunny, but I mean, you can see
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Blue Sky.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I don't see any blue skies all white above me.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Scott Bourne is, of course, with podcasting tricks
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and Padango and -- what is it?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   ApplephoneShow.com.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The little site that any day now is going to become a big site.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And Mr. Inatko will be joining me occasionally, I hope.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Oh, really?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Indeed, I will.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Andy Inatko is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He is also the creator of the colossal waste of bandwidth
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and is now broadcasting to you from Studio A.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Studio A, it's stately Dunscap Studios and beautiful
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   crime-free Boston Massachusetts.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The reason that he calls it Dunscap Studios?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yes, because I was recording podcasts for a while,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   just lying down comfortably on my sofa.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And then I realized there's a reason why you shouldn't --
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   you should expend a certain minimum number of calories,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   because otherwise you sound like Paul Anka introducing his
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   third show of the day and trying to get excited.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   This makes you all leap to my feet and stretch.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So it got the most uncomfortable steel lab chair that I could
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   get out of storage, put it in the corner of my office,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   put the boom mic, put the steel typing table, nothing padded,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   nothing -- it encourages fidgeting, it encourages shifting
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   around, and most of all, it encourages shutting up very,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   very quickly so you can just leave that place, that awful place
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and think about what you did, just like being told to sit
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   in the corner and think about that awful, awful thing that you did.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It's just every time I'm podcasting you.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Actually, I'm actually --
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   --in comfortable as hell, yeah.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And kind of, you know, grim.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   In fact, that was one of the problems I had when I started doing
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   the radio show from home, I don't do it from home anymore.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I have a little office, but it was too relaxing.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You couldn't get going.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Plus, all your equipment is like scattered to the three different
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   wins, especially if I've just been traveling.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So I can't tell you how many times I started a podcast using
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   the built-in microphone of my power book.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Well, I'll say, "Well, Scott, I'm over here.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I thought I'd illustrate the problems of XML encoding by
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   running around desperately looking for something while I speak."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'm an educator, Bill.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Hey, we got some stories.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It took us about an hour to think of what we were going to talk
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   about today, but we got some stories starting off with the
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   iPhone picks up on Flickr taken down very quickly, which
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   actually led me to believe they were real.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What happened to Merlin?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Well, what happened was -- there's a great feature on Flickr
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that I think is -- will become much better known now, which
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   is that you can go out and find photos that were taken using
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   a certain kind of brand and model of camera.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Somebody basically noticed -- generally, it says on every
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   photo what camera was used to take it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And somebody noticed there was a couple photos up that said
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   they were taken with an Apple iPhone.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You know, you could fake -- you can easily edit the EXIF data.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Can you?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yes, you can.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's simple to do.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   You could do it in aperture, probably.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   But it said camera, Apple iPhone.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Orientation rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which tells me it has
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   some sort of motion sensor or a position.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Do you think they are real, though?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, I'll tell you why I think they're real.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   First of all, the fact that they were taken down immediately
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   is a little telling.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Second of all, you know, the folks who discovered this
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   mobilegarilla.com did a little research.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Turns out this pictured as a cafe very near Cupertino,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   California.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's actually a steakhouse called Alexander's,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   three miles from Apple HQ.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   They were marked --
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   They were put up there by the steakhouse.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That's a ticket.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They were marked private.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They certainly are camera phone pictures, but they're high
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   res, 1600 by 1200, which is about three megapixels.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   As the only one who's ever touched an iPhone,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   actually, you have two, haven't you, Andy?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I have.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Andy answered that.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Not as long as Andy has.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Do either of you know what the resolution of the camera is?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Information wasn't provided to me.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I believe they said 1600 by 1200.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Well, that's what these pictures are.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That's a lot of things.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Because I remember being surprised it wasn't higher resolution.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, I don't have any evidence of this, but I have heard numerous
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   reports from people in the valley that there are at least a few,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   like where you can see people walking around with them.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm not going to source that, but I'm just going to say lots of
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   people have seen these out in the way, at least a few.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, I get sent, you know, being the proprietor of Apple
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   PhoneShow.com.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I get sent about 100 fake pics a day.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Well, some of them are really, really bad, and some of them are
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   pretty darn good, but the bottom line is, I really don't care.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   These are pictures of, understand, these are pictures of the iPhone.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   No, no, no, I understand.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The pictures taken with you.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I get, I get, I get both flavors.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I get some that are supposed to be the iPhone on the street.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Mobile Gorilla says that they have confirmed now that the
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   pictures were uploaded by an Apple employee.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Well, whatever Mobile Gorilla says must be true.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Well, I believe it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I have a feeling that we should ask the Mac-a-lope.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I think it's Mac-a-lope.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Here we go.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Now, I have to say there's a greenish cast to the higher res of the two
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   pictures.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   They're very camera phone-esque.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   You know, they have that feeling, you know, kind of extra over jpegged.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And yet there's a lot of detail in the 1600 by 1200.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's a good looking picture.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Well, for whatever it's worth, the camera phone app that was running in
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   January had exactly one button on it.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So I know, so I know that it wasn't being, the camera phone software
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   wasn't being developed.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It's not on the same track.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It wasn't at the same level of complexity in January as the other apps.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So it's possible they're still just playing catch up with that part of the software.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I totally believe that this is it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Let me just ask you a question.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   If you're an Apple employee, what in the world would possess you to upload
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   something to Flickr?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Oh, a couple of reasons.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Well, who cares?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I mean, you're taking a picture of the phone, aren't you?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Maybe you're testing.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Right.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You didn't know, first of all, you didn't know that would be detectable
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   that it was an iPhone.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Not everybody knows that XF information is uploaded to Flickr or were exposed
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   by Flickr.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Second of all, you might be testing Flickr upload.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I mean, my phone, my Nokia 95, has built-in Flickr uploading.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Maybe that's on the iPhone.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now that makes sense.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   It was uploaded.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Yeah, Vox and Flickr.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So once you enter your account-
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I have to do like seven clicks on my-
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You know what?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I have to- sometimes we'll sit down the four of us and I'll show you this at Nokia
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   95 because I think you're going to like it.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think until the iPhone comes out, it's clearly the best phone out there.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You're just trying to not get your ass kicked by the sky.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   No.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Now listen, listen, I'm sure we don't want to-
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I'm going to buy an iPhone.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I have a singular sim chip sitting right here.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And I'll probably buy one.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You don't need to buy one, Leo.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Oh, I buy- I almost always buy everything.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   If memory serves, you're going to get-
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Oh, Scott's going to buy me one.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   No, you know-
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He's already denied that he's going to do this.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He thinks he's going to sweep this under the rug like every scandal he's ever had in his life.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's not going to happen.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I'm not going to go gently into that good phone carrier.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I'm going to have an iPhone and-
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Oh, my iPhone!
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Mr. Man, I hate to break you out of this fantasy, but here's the thing about-
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   You're going to rest out of a fantasy?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Here's the thing about podcasts.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   There aren't- Leaguely-
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   There- There- There- You can go look at and- and listen to that show and listen carefully to what I said,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   and you'll realize that you are an heir.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You know, Scott, the day that I start listening carefully to everything-
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Hey!
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Anyway, I want my damn phone.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Anyway, continue.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The N95 looks beautiful though.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It's a nice phone.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I've been very- It's super happy.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Battery life's not great.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I have chargers everywhere I go.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But only if you use all the features.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I mean, it has so many-
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   How long is the battery life?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Uh, well, I killed it in three hours the first day.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I got it because I'd used the GPS and the Bluetooth and I was uploading pictures and I was-
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You know, I used every possible feature.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   By the way, Skype works on it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I can- Wow.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I can make calls, in fact- Wait a minute.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I should call you guys.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It looks for an open AP and just starts now.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I'm going to call in.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Hold on.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Um, yeah, I have a- I have an open Wi-Fi access point here, right?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Leo, we're getting de- just the interesting-
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   This is your- The singularity.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   This here is- This here is a geek talking, and I'm talking- You're- You're freaking geek.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Okay.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I'm holding a telephone in my hand that is connected to the most reliable and world-wide communication network, but no, I'm going to use a really dodgy IP telephone.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It's free!
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Yeah, but if- That's the point, it's free!
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So, I'm going to call.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Now, let me just drive 12 miles of fire to find a penara bled bread or something open to Wi-Fi access point.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Well, here's the interesting thing.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It works, and this is the thing that's got to scare carriers.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Uh, it works pretty well, even with edge.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So, I don't actually have to get to an access point.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Now, see, wait a minute, if it works well with edge, that starts this whole possible rat hole that, you know, all the Apple haters and iPhone haters will be disappointed to find out that the iPhone works well with edge too.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Well, it works well.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I didn't say it works well, surfing that with edge.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It works well, okay.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Uh...
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Is that- Is that like failover?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   If it- If it, uh, I mean, can you have one contiguous call and it'll change the way it's paid carry?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   No, I don't think so.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So, it's just like, you know, and Skype isn't that smart.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   That would be "elfin magic" if it had like a hybrid, just to be open magic.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Yeah, no, that would- that's- don't get a little- don't get too- let's see, call.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's just gonna- I just can't stop looking at this dry aged beef in this photo.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It does look good.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I'm going to Alex.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You're right, it might have been posted by Alex Andrews.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It looks so good.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Yeah, let's see, that just shows you, like, the difference in granularity between your observations.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I was looking at your pictures and your Flickr feed and saying, "Wow, why is Leo using such a crappy camera?"
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   That's a phone.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Wow, those are fantastic thinkers.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That's exactly right, isn't it?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Well, let me just ask the question.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Even if these are from the iPhone at this early stage, what does it matter?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Because generally, like, as Andy was alluding to, I mean, the final tweaks on the-
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Oh, it's not that early, dude.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I think we're very close to shipping.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Right?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I think we're too much away.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, I don't think you're going to see it before June.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think it's gonna be- I think it's- I think it's- I think it's-
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Well, this is May, dude.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Dude?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Well, four weeks in May, four weeks in June, that technically means they need to June definitely.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I don't think you're going to see big changes in the quality of the pictures.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Well, that's the kind of thing that's the easiest to change.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   That's just a software tweak.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, it's all the same really cheap, horrible pencil tip size plastic lens.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's all software that makes it actually work and look like a decent picture.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Unless you have a really cool Nokia N95, and who do you know for that?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I don't have N95.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.200]   Okay wait a minute, hold on a second, I'm calling. Hold on, all right. I'm going I want to
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.440]   - already I'm ON I want to conference myself in now. I'm going to myself in now. So this
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:21.520]   is talking to you. Talking to you via the. I have the Nokia N95. Um, and the Y, and
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:30.280]   y-axis point. It's time for an intervention now. Right, good. But this is but so here's
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   the point. But this is for you. Here's the point. This is a free call. It's not going
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.520]   through the Delphon network. It's absolutely amazing. It cost me $4 a month to call anywhere
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:47.200]   in the entire country for free Leo. Okay. That's for the good. That's for the new. It's
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   not like talking to the International Space Station where there's like a 1.5 second latency.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.760]   Okay, you're right. There is a rather long latency. And the paper is want to know who
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.320]   you're going to share with you where Leo, who's what I who? Hello. Anyway, I do all
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.640]   look like Ants from up here. That was a Skype call. Now that was over Wi-Fi through my N95
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.520]   phone. Geez, you know, you know, who's going to like that is, uh, is Alex Lindsay. Yeah,
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.960]   because if you're in Africa, you go, I know that won't work. Oh, no. I mean, there's not
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.560]   one of his his just the same point. Yeah. He's he's, you know, Alex who wants the iPhone,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.520]   but without the phone. Yeah. You have to be chasing the world. Go on it. By the way,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   I'm going to be cheating because I cost so much. I have to go plug in the Nokia now
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:36.380]   because it's just killed the battery. Oh my gosh. See, who's the cool guy with the
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.200]   Nokia N95? Well, that guy is carrying that motorcycle battery in a battery. Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.840]   So you can have 10 hours of standby time. So Leo, that's kind of cool that you can use
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.040]   this. That is actually pretty cool. Yeah. You got a U hall behind your Lexus Leo for
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.640]   your battery. No, no, but that even points out a problem that we're going to have with
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.360]   the iPhone that I have with every single smartphone. I love having one device that's
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.480]   what I don't have to carry like four different things with me. Well, on the other hand, I
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.160]   need to be able to place and receive phone calls if my car breaks down. So I tend not
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.080]   to use these cool media features. I tend not to use Wi-Fi features unless I absolutely
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.800]   have to. Well, the other thing you could do is carry a little extra battery. I don't
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.920]   don't think the battery has a USB. Yeah. AP APC makes this really cool USB. There you
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.800]   go. Like 10 hour battery can recharge. Moving on. Speaking of batteries, Apple shipped
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.760]   a 700k battery update for the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. They claim will fix battery
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.840]   problems. I downloaded and installed it, but I mean, I wasn't having problems anyway.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:40.040]   And I guess I'd ask the question, why would a 700k fix solve problems like battery? It
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.160]   looks like battery distortion or warping is one of the problems it fixes. I don't understand.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.960]   Yeah, your battery magically shrinks when you have this 700k file. I have to think that
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.880]   there's nothing in this file that this is a place exactly when I was wondering. You're
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.720]   testing gullibility in the market here. Let's see if this is iPhone 2, too. What, you know,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.200]   so the battery problem, some of it was the battery wasn't charging. And I guess, you
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.480]   know, that could be fixed, I guess, in firmware. Right. I never had any problems with the one
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.920]   in my Mac. Has anybody here had any Merlin? No. No. The problems were it's startup wake
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.560]   from sleep or when you put the battery in. This is supposed to improve battery life and
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   reduce swelling. Well, actually, there's there's sort of I learned about this like six or
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.920]   seven months ago, not about Apple, but through, let's say another major, major designer of
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:39.040]   power of portable electronics that apparently there really is a black art to how you charge
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.600]   the battery. If you have a really stupid device that just plugs and cooks up to DC power and
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.720]   charges it that way, you'll get a certain you'll get a certain satisfying level of charge.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.120]   However, if you can really fine tune the firmware so that it not not only senses but the charge
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.680]   level it is what the charge level is, but how it's responding to the charge, you can
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.400]   basically keep ramping it up and down sort of saw tooth a little bit, right, to not only
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.760]   extend the life of the battery because of, you know, you get more charges and recharge,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.400]   but also making sure you're not heating it up quite so much to the, you know, all those,
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.320]   all those, those, those, let's see little chemical bonds get broken down. It's likely
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.920]   that this file is just changing the parameters of how it's charging. Right. It's basically
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.280]   changing the changing the idea of, well, it's about it's it'll, it'll, it'll start to really
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.000]   hammer it at this point, and then it'll start tailing off and tailing off and tailing off.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.560]   It might take again, I haven't, I haven't downloaded this update yet, but if it's like
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.000]   other updates that I've heard about it, people, these engineers have told me about, it'll
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.920]   take a little bit longer to recharge these batteries. However, it'll extend the life
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:44.400]   of the battery by like four or five months. Okay. So we, so it's not voodoo. Oh, it's voodoo.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.960]   It's voodoo voodoo. It's the, it's got the John de Conqueru and the, and the mongo tooth,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   but still, if I get four months to add my battery, although that will do it for me. Did
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.920]   everybody download it? I did. Yeah. I did. I, I can't tell if anything. Yeah, why not?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.640]   I mean, I wasn't having problems to begin with. I don't have any bloating if that's
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.840]   the, it's the Mac. It's the Mac book that's getting the bloating. Right. It's not the
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.800]   Mac. I don't know. Oh, so it's only, this wasn't, this isn't related to your personal
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.320]   bloating. I'm just retaining water. I have thick ankles and I like to dance. I, what
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.880]   can I say? I, uh, yeah, I think it's a Mac book issue, right? I installed something for
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.200]   my battery. Well, whatever the update is for Mac books and Mac books pro, MacBook pros,
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.600]   battery update 1.2. You'll get it via software update. Uh, MacBook, MacBook Lake, 2006,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.200]   Mac's, but pro 15 and 17 inch. Uh, it says after battery update has been stalled, each
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.480]   battery you insert into your Mac book or MacBook pro will automatically be updated. So apparently
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.560]   it actually downloads into the battery. This just sounds too weird to me. The battery
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.400]   updater will check to see if a battery needs to be updated on startup wake from sleep or
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.680]   when a battery is inserted. In this case, if, if in these cases, there's no AC power
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.400]   supply to wait till you've got it plugged in and then it will update the battery. There
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   was firmware in the battery. So it flashes it. Wow. That's pretty amazing. I think it is
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.760]   food. We fixing your battery. There's some things man was not meant to know. I think
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.800]   what they call it, the Hawthorne effect where you just, you notice it because you're meant
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.840]   to notice it, you know, it's right. Well, unless my car runs better after I wash it.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.560]   Yes. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. You can't, you can't say that apples just sitting on their hands
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.840]   here. They're issuing battery updates and everything. I got really excited because I
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.320]   got, oh boy, I'm going to get another brand new battery for my Mac book, the third one.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.800]   Yeah. Another reason why it's going to explode. I love this. I love this. I've heard this
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.480]   software download. Wow. When's the last time you saw Microsoft introducing this kind of
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.960]   the speedball. Exactly. My point. And I just want to, I just want to point out that they
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.320]   were not late in getting this. No, I'm out there. Immediately. Well, speaking of patches,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.040]   there is today, as we record this, a new patch for quick time that fixes that kind of icky
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:06.120]   Java issue with quick time. So you certainly should apply this because there are exploits,
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.080]   Safari based exploits, although I think it would actually probably work with any browser.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.480]   Any browser. Yes. Any browser. It's just time. So it's quick time, 7.1.6. It also adds
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:22.000]   support for Final Cut Studio 2, but it does fix that issue with a quick time. That was
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.880]   pretty fast. That was, we were talking about this flaw last week and they've got it out
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.120]   already. Can't complain about that. So you feel good about that. You feel like that's,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.560]   we do talk about that last week. You feel like that was responsive. That's about how
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.120]   long did you take? Well, I mean, well, it's a difficult thing. Except for the fact that
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.240]   it had been around for so long. Yeah. Did they know the question is how, when did they know
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.640]   about it and how long did it take them to create the fix? These things can't, I mean,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.080]   Microsoft takes months off into ship patches. Was this something that they just found out
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.200]   as a result of the contest thing? Had somebody been sitting on this? I didn't read that. Actually,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.240]   you know, John Greer interviewed the guy who did the exploit on Daring Fireball. I haven't
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.360]   had a chance to read it yet, but he did a long interview with the guy. Yeah, it was the
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:11.420]   Mac hacking contest at a Kansec West. And they took a Mac and using Safari and this quick
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:18.640]   time exploit, we were able to own the Mac. The exploit functions courtesy of a previously
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:26.080]   unknown flaw. Okay. It says this is according to Mata Sano security, the experts who did
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.400]   this hack work there. malicious code sent through the web pages or through the web plugin for
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.120]   the Apple software can expose any system to potential attacks. Now, by the way, it affects
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.520]   Windows too. I presume and I haven't tried it yet that Apple will have an update for
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.200]   quick time in Windows as well. Actually, that's an interesting question. Let me launch
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.000]   quick time in Windows and see what happens. I think getting this out in a week is pretty
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.080]   good because something some people don't stop to think about is they have to test to see
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.680]   what this is going to blow up. No, that's right. That's exactly why Microsoft usually
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.920]   takes months to do these. And even then sometimes gets it wrong, the animated cursor flaw, which
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:06.160]   Microsoft knew about three months before they patched the first patch had a major problem
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.320]   with one of the common chipsets on Windows. So it's a difficult thing to do. You know,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.600]   it may be that in this case, it was an easy fix. You know, just Oh, well, that's simple.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.520]   You just flip that bit there. So does that make you a little bit uncomfortable? It's
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.680]   like when you accidentally leave your keys in your car parked outside and then you're
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.880]   a little bit disappointed the next point to find out that nobody's stolen it, that nobody
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   thinks your car is stealing this exploits, but around for months and months and months
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.440]   and finally, again, I guess, close the whole little is that your theory, Leo, that basically
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.280]   people don't want to steal our car. I think after I looked at the fact that, you know,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.040]   this hacks now out there, it's known. I don't know how much information that the
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:53.480]   Metasano released, but you notice there were no in the wild attacks over the last week.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.320]   It doesn't it takes sort of a perfect storm to make this thing work that way? I mean,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.560]   it's not something just any old hacker would know, is it? Well, if the once the code is
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:10.440]   published, it's, you know, it's a pretty standard kind of a hack as far as I can tell. So once
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.920]   the code and I see, I don't think they published exploit code. So I think it's more like the
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.720]   same reason why Chevrolet doesn't make bagels. I mean, people who write viruses and worms
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.400]   know the nastiness, they're not in the Macintosh business. They just doesn't occur to them
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.160]   that they could do this or that they could profit from it. Well, and this is what we were
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.240]   talking about last week. There's only a few what we know, there's 4% of all the computers out there
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.800]   are max. If you want to take over a computer for purposes of forwarding spam or distributed
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.560]   denial of services attacks, you're going to take over windows computers. There's just more of them.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.200]   They're more useful. Yeah, but I'm okay with it. Stand that way. Yeah, you know, in a way,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.080]   that really argues for let's not talk too well about math. Let's not get too many people
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   switch. Yeah, exactly. See, it seems to me, if I were going to be out there doing this stuff,
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.200]   and that's a question I've actually always had is are people writing these on windows?
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   Or yes, they have windows. They write them for windows because that's where all the computers are.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.440]   They can test the exploit. But it's funny because I mean, it seems to me, and maybe I don't understand
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:09.640]   the ethos or the whole reason you would do this kind of cracky stuff, but it seems to me like
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.400]   you would want to go after max at this point just because we are so kind of high at mighty.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.160]   It's a pretty fat target. Well, also because everything's completely
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.720]   unsecure. There's no or rather, there's no explicit utility that people are installing to
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.960]   prevent the sort of thing from happening. Why? We don't have spyware. We don't have any viruses.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.120]   Right. And when we are talking about an industry in terms of people who creating this malware
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.480]   that don't care about this one big score that will land 40% of all computers, we have guys who,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.680]   you know, you have phishing scams that you get the exact same phishing email, you know, to get an
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.960]   eBay password four times in your inbox. One, two, three, four, you know, that they don't really care
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.520]   about, you know, getting 20% 40% of people. They care about one way that they can get at least
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.800]   10 more IDs per hour. And I don't know, if I were in this business, I would start thinking,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.240]   well, you know, let's, let's, you know, invest a little bit of money in creating some, some
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.440]   Mac viruses and just see what happens, see if it gets us some dough.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.640]   So you think they're on their way and you think it's financial? You think this is primarily to you?
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.920]   Oh, we know that now. We know that now. It used to be it was bragging rights or it was vandalism,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.000]   but really in the last few years, it's been not not last few years. I mean, you look at,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.240]   you look at some of the identity theft systems out there, some of the, the eBay fraud system,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.800]   some of the pay pad, pal fraud systems. This isn't even some, some guys in college trying to make
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.720]   some beer money or trying to do something illicit. You're talking about a company that's very,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.360]   very well funded, that has a really admirably ambitious research and development wing.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.040]   I mean, when you look at some of these devices that are being installed inside
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:43.400]   speed pass kiosks at gas stations, devices that certain waitresses and waiters and restaurants
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.160]   are having, you're talking about very sophisticated electronics that are designed to acquire
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.320]   credit card information. This isn't stuff that people are just home brewing inside their garages.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.720]   But you make a good point. If they're going to go after ATMs and gas stations going after
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.920]   Mac, there's a lot more Macs out there. So you're, you actually make a good point. There,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.960]   there is certainly enough critical mass for them to, to see it as a, I was a valid target.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   Right. So we should expect these attacks soon.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.320]   Again, it's, I really do think it's going to happen at some point. I also, I'm a, I'm a little bit of,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.680]   I'm a Macintosh egoist to think that there are technical reasons why they haven't really
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.400]   deployed something successful yet. But I really don't, I have a really, really surprise of it.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.160]   Some whiteboard at some really, really skanky, you know, office retail complex.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.560]   Some of these are saying, well, here's 10 grand. Here's three months. See what you can do to
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.160]   Macintosh. And just, just so you understand, on the windows side, you know, Mark Rissinovitch,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.080]   who now works for Microsoft, is very, very well respected security researcher, has said,
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.640]   has spoken speaking recently at a security conference, maybe, maybe even the same security
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.920]   conference, said, look, we're going to see attacks on Vista too. Yeah, there's user access control.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.240]   Yeah, we've done all these things, but that doesn't kind of stop people from figuring out other ways
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   to get into Vista. It's just, you know, it's a, it's a seesaw battle. So yeah, maybe it'll happen.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.960]   Interestingly, I just ran a quick time and asked for updates on Windows and there are, there isn't
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.520]   an update yet, which may be the, I'm bolster the argument that it's easier to patch it on the Mac
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:18.360]   than it is to patch it on Windows. You got a lot more systems to test on Windows and a lot,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.880]   a lot more heterogeneous environment. What version, key, tell what version of quick time
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.640]   you're running on Windows? Seven. Yeah, well, I'll tell you a second. I'm just, it's seven one,
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.480]   but I don't know if it's what seven one was. This is seven one six is the one that wants to install
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:36.600]   right now. Right. Let me just tell you real quick Apple QuickTime Player. Hello, Apple QuickTime
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:42.360]   Player. Speak to me. It takes a little while to launch up here, but I did, I did ask it to update
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.240]   and said your, your software is up today. Thank you for clicking. Quick time. Your computer is a
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.440]   zombie thinking, thinking, working, working, working. Your security is important to us.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.560]   Working. Your computer is the 10,000 computer that will be updated to us both this security patch.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.880]   Thank you for calling out the customer service operator. All of our operators are busy. All two
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.240]   of them. It's seven one five. So it hasn't been updated to seven one six. And it says there is no
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.200]   seven one six. Yeah. I think Apple's official position is that the best security patch for Windows is
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:19.400]   Mac OS. That's a T-shirt. Your credit card will be charged $1,800 for the security patch.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.400]   The large box will arrive shortly. Unplug all cables from your existing Windows machine.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:32.440]   Now, interestingly enough, there also is a airport update and an update for an update.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:40.680]   Version 1.1 of the 2007 dash 004 update released earlier this month. So Apple is patching flaws
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.160]   and update. I didn't get that patch. And I'm not sure if that's because I don't know why. I did
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.280]   get the airport patch in the patch for a quick time. That's what I got. Yeah. So I'm not sure
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.160]   there's 1.1 patch. That's this is according to a MacRumors.com. Well, the good news is that,
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.280]   you know, all of us who have our airport addictions, this patch will just, you know,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.680]   tail us off of this addiction little by little. What is the noise we're missing it? It's not working.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:10.440]   Go get a life. Go outside and play. Let's see what else here. Steve Jobs says,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.280]   never say never, but we're not planning on doing subscriptions and iTunes anytime soon.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.560]   What's that? Are you talking to us? But the lightsaber down,
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.640]   Darth Sidious is not on his way.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:34.680]   So now, you know, he's quick to say never say never. So does that, is this disinformation?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.000]   What is he up to here? I really bet that there's a contractual reason why he doesn't want to get
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.560]   into this. I don't understand that. That's one of the areas of iTunes store where I just don't
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.840]   understand why Apple doesn't get into subscriptions because that is a real marketing, but that is a
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.520]   real feature weakness that they have compared to urge. Well, you know how does media based
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.320]   systems? Yeah, but you know how Steve is. He's very dogmatic and it's the same reason there isn't,
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.840]   of course, he said for a long time, we won't put video on an iPod either because nobody wants to
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.480]   watch a video on a screen that small, but he says people want to own their music and you know
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.680]   how Steve is when he believes something like that. That's all it matters. He says,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:16.120]   Apple is not planning on selling music by a subscription model. You think it's contractual
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.240]   and Steve's just putting a good spin on it? I have no idea. I'm trying to figure out,
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.760]   I don't think there's a technical reason why they can't do it. I don't think that there is a
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.200]   user reason why they wouldn't want to do it. He says it's failed so far that the subscription
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.720]   model is a reason he would want to see that for business reasons. I mean, I mean, everybody
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.960]   always wants to say it's so typical of us to want to make this about what Steve wants in the world
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.240]   and what Steve thinks. But from a strictly business standpoint, that's a pretty big piece of the
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.440]   market to just seed as something you're not even going to try to touch. Yeah. Regardless of his
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.280]   own feelings about quote unquote, whether people want it. Well, I mean, as he shown, if it's done
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.480]   correctly, people can want almost anything, you know? Yeah, true. Steve also said that we will offer
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:59.640]   the ability to do DRM free music to any label that wish would wish to. I presume network, the
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.400]   label in Canada that's offering DRM free music on PureTrex would be one of the first to step up.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:12.680]   He says anybody wants to do DRM free music. You know, he says there are a lot of people. This is a
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.600]   quote. There are a lot of people in other music companies who are very intrigued by it. They're
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   thinking very hard about it right now. He says, we have said by the end of this year, over half the
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.160]   songs we offer on iTunes, we believe will be in DRM free versions. I think we're going to achieve
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:33.240]   that. Now, isn't this the month that that's supposed to happen for EMI? May 1st. Well, okay.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   Well, it's still May. The celebratory tank is going through Main Street. Let the parade go
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.200]   by first. Are you going to start singing the international?
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.040]   Why do you know it is the question? Well, it's like this. The Bosque and Pure Society
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.000]   Mac group, we had a director who was a real, there's a word that, well, this is the dinner
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.920]   show, but I won't use the word anyway. I felt that he needed to be taught a lesson about being
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.640]   just a stuck up dictator. He was a teacher. So I wrote a hypercard stack that would teach the
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.280]   entire membership how to sing the Soviet national anthem in the originals. You know,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.160]   and fortunately, he flamed out and was fired before I could deploy this. But in the course of
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.040]   writing this hypercard stack, of course, I learned how to sing the entire. I just wanted 300 people
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:35.320]   to spontaneously start saying, party, and Nina. And he would just have to sit there and still
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.600]   for a good four minutes as we stood. And it would have been wonderful. But no, the bastard had to
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   like falsify. I shouldn't say it, but he got handy. Andy, Andy, Andy, how do you get as much free
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.200]   time as you have? That's what I want to know. My genius is so quick. I see. Okay. Just like
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.480]   Edison, I sleep two hours a day. I have pingerton goons who do a lot of my work for me.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:05.160]   Everybody now, please rise as we sing the communist national anthem.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:13.720]   That's the international action. I'm looking at the theme from Pippi Long's.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.280]   Not going to be a porn pipe. I don't remember Soviet Navy singing in that in the hunt for
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:24.840]   October. Do you want to hear it in Turkish? I do. I have a Chinese. I have a I don't think the
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.680]   Turks have ever won a gold medal in anything. So I'm not sure if I can identify the national anthem.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.240]   Is there a possible way that you can have a rat hole within a rat hole? We just got pretty
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.320]   close to that. This is the Klein model of rat holes. There's no insight around says.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.920]   There you go.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.320]   And I'll translate as they sing.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:58.920]   Arise the star of ladies, more workers from your slumbers. Arise the criminals of want.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.840]   For reasons in revolt. Now funders.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   And at last ends the age of Kant.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.080]   We are good.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.600]   Excuse me. I got a phone call from some guy here from Homeland Security wants to talk to you guys.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.880]   I don't think I don't think you want to talk to us. That's how inspirational it is.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.080]   The communists are the good guys now. It's the ARabs you got to worry about.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.680]   Oh man.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.760]   We're just going to let you continue on that line.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   That was said by Leo the port. I'm sorry. We don't have the Turkish one.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.720]   The Turkish one set to a disco beat. If you can be pretty fast with your editing bleeping
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.000]   finger, you could play Jonathan Colton's wonderful song The First of May.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.800]   Oh, where's that?
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.720]   I just sent you the link in the in the side.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.640]   All right. That would be highly recommended.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.040]   This is also kind of a commie thing or what?
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.160]   It's not a commie thing. It's a celebration of the first the first day.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.960]   It's clear. It's cold. It's the first day of May. It's celebrating what you can start doing after
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.920]   May 1st. This is the lusty month of May.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.840]   Yeah, that's right. That's right. Can I play it from this page? This is just the lyrics.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.960]   Only yeah, you can hit the download the mp3. Download the mp3. All right.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.680]   But you're going to want to come back later with your bleepy finger.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.560]   Oh, there's some bad words in it. If there's one, there's one.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.320]   Here we go. Joko, ladies and gentlemen. The first of the day.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:34.440]   I woke up this morning. I had a scone and a large house plan.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:41.720]   Then a little conversation with my squirrel and chip my friends.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:47.400]   I said I'm sick and tired of wind and I wish that it was spring.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:54.760]   Then a little fella named Robin Redbreth began to sing.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.600]   And he sang. Ooh, child, what do you think of Kowent?
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:08.120]   It's going to last forever. Child, now's the time for other people to get together.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.240]   It's not exactly a risey starvlings of...
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.080]   Well, you're just about to get to the good part.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.880]   I am the good part. All right. Here's the good part, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.480]   This is the chorus. This is the chorus. All right.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   [Music]
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.640]   [Music]
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:48.520]   We start playing a Red Fox record soon. I got a couple here.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.000]   Do you have them? Because I'm open to that. I've never listened to one all the way through.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.400]   I aborted about three minutes. I've got that at one hour, 11 minutes.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.840]   Yeah, I wrote it down. Okay. Outdoor bleeping starts today.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.320]   Beautiful weather outside. I agree. Outdoor bleeping is time.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.200]   Outdoor bleeping. Outdoor bleeping starts today.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.120]   And I said, Ooh, child, I'll bring a blanket and I promise I will brush the ants off.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.480]   Ooh, child, you're going to like it when we're taking each other's pants off.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.360]   That's just, that's porter. Captain, you're so smooth.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.800]   Here I'm 102.1 FM. Give it a break. Give it a break.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.720]   Give it a break. Give it a break.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.080]   You can try it on the ice.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.160]   Ease starvlings from your slumbers. Yeah, see, it doesn't have the same ring to it.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.880]   Unbreakable union of freeborn republics. United we stand.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.160]   Our might was created by will of the people and now let us rejoice.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.560]   So sweet Soviet land. Party of Lenin.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.800]   Yes, they would still be around if they said outdoor
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.680]   [Music] starts today.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.760]   Ha ha ha. They didn't see they didn't have to because they had those huge,
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   huge like missiles on parade.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.560]   Okay, this family walks into town eight size.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.360]   Okay, watch this. Usually don't book.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.520]   Watch this in the KGB office and says chairman.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.440]   I've got the hell interrogation technique. You got auditioning.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.800]   Hell of an act you got there. What do you call it?
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.760]   We got it the rattle. Okay, you guys, you can cut out a full 20 minute.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.120]   We call it the new eastern europe.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.000]   20 minutes cut out 20 minutes of that and no one will ever listen.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.160]   I don't know. I think it's kind of fun.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   We'll have to ask the live audience who's heard everything we've said at this point.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.840]   And they're probably recording it for their own rogue broadcast.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.720]   Oh, actually we're recording.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.360]   You know, you will actually the unedited version will appear on
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.480]   TalkShoe. Oh boy.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.240]   So basically they'll be playing this audio on MSNBC with pictures of us.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.080]   What are they going to do?
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.360]   What are they going to do? They can't do anything.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.760]   A podcast with we're going to leave you.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   We're going to have to talk about this Leo before we open up the
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.000]   Padango productions live feed.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.560]   Okay. All right. All right. All right.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.000]   Speaking of Steve Jobs, he's going to be in the keynote at WWDC,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.080]   but that's he always does. So there's no news.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.240]   We thought the guy from singular was going to do it.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.200]   Yeah, with his singular note cards.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.000]   There's a guy who's still using the hipster.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.440]   And the hipster PDA guy. This is this is one of Merlin's buds.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.360]   Poor guy. You're so mean to him, Scott. He's just he's one guy who got up on
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.720]   stage with like the best presenter ever and he had cards.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.600]   Yeah, which kind of proves that he's just a guy worthy of scorn.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.040]   Yeah, I've been reading Steven.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.640]   See you up there with Steve.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.320]   You know, I'm never going to one of my new pieces or nephews like Christmas
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.960]   specials, Christmas trip a pageant. Oh God. Another recorder solo.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.600]   You suck. Hey, she's playing it with her nose.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.080]   And bubbles are coming out the end. So what does that mean?
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.200]   What does that mean that he's going to be?
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.960]   I think he always does. I mean, I don't think that's really.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.720]   And they thought it was going to be three hours, but now it's not really going to be three hours.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.760]   Is that what I read? It's not going to be the iPhone because it's not ready, right?
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.800]   It won't be June 11th.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.920]   It's just going to be a repeat in last year's WWDC.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.840]   Hey, we got this new thing coming out called leopard.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.800]   It'll be ready pretty soon. Here's your beta. Here's yeah, in October.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:03.000]   Did you hear about an iPhone delay? I don't heard about an iPhone.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.760]   Yeah, end of the month. Really? Okay.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.960]   Are they saying that now? It'll be June 30th on June 11th.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.520]   Didn't they say that?
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.440]   Okay. Yeah. Well, Apple, I don't think the June 11th date was ever that real, but they're saying in June.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.240]   Okay.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.480]   I hope they're writing you check, Scott. I really do.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.880]   I'm just telling you the truth. Show me where Apple said.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.200]   You're like, I don't know. You're like Apple's karma lawyer.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.320]   Like you're always rising to object. I'm asking a simple.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.080]   I'm just asking a simple question. Point to me where Apple Computer or Apple Incorporated said,
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.440]   we will have it shipping June 11th.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   I'm not going to follow you down that path, counselor.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.000]   It's not going to happen.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.520]   Do you want me to try to get this? Follow the money.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.440]   Should we try to get Scott's blood pressure a little higher?
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.880]   Yeah. I could do it.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:50.120]   Mike Elgin in computer world. Actually, it's an old story, but
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.520]   Macworld just started just to mention it.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:59.320]   Says jobs keynote introducing the iPhone blew it. Here are the six reasons why jobs blew it.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   He raised expectations too high.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.560]   He raised Wall Street expectations too high. It's true. The stock is still over 100 or it's
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.640]   hovering at 100. It's over 100.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.440]   Gave competitors a head start.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.760]   We have seen a lot of people trying to do something similar. There's even now that
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   open moku project, the open source iPhone project.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.920]   Yeah. Open moku.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.880]   It's Soviet engineering.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.480]   Well, there's no phone, but you've got the software. It's beautiful.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.720]   You got a community man. It's called you got the community. You lose the food.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.160]   Oh, they got a big community.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.840]   Soviet Russia phone calls you.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:43.000]   I wait 14 months for these tickets. It was 12 months.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.400]   What a country. Once a quarter, I'm allowed to do the
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.880]   yuck. Open what? Open what?
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.320]   What in Branson?
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.600]   Coaching the other computer.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   Moku. Open M-O-K-U.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.920]   Is that my phone?
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.840]   Jesus. Your battery is flat, dude.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.520]   At one point in time did we lose complete control of this show. I'm just curious.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.760]   My phone's talking to me and saying Leo Lapper.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.200]   Another Mac brick quickly.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.080]   Leo Lapper.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.920]   Can I set up this Apple script that says the word Mac every three minutes just to keep this
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.800]   tax deductible?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.160]   Yeah. There you go. There you go.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.920]   Mac.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.720]   Number four.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.200]   There you go.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:16.920]   Mac.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.240]   Number four. Jobs undermined Apple TV.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.600]   Oh, Lord.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.360]   Easy under minor.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.040]   Well, he's a Pixar character.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.280]   No, no.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.600]   Six. Jobs wrecked Cisco talks.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.240]   Well, there you go.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.280]   And I rest my case.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.000]   He has a plate to steal Christmas as well, I wait for her.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.360]   He stole the last letter from the new Christmas tree.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.160]   We have concluded the news portion of the show.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.080]   I can't find the rat hole music anywhere.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.840]   You didn't mention the most important iPhone related news,
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.880]   which is this is the thing that's going to have the big impact.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.840]   Steve Bomer says it's not going anywhere, so last I heard they're just shipping everything
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.200]   out from Cupertino and giving up on account of Steve says it ain't going to work.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.800]   Well, Steve's pretty sharp.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.160]   They're buying a coffee franchise.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.040]   He went to Harvard.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.160]   And he the guy behind the zoom.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.360]   He's I don't know if he's behind the zoom.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.200]   The zoom is pretty much behind, you mean?
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:16.520]   You know, the iPhone, it's like everybody loves to attack whatever Apple's doing,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.720]   because you know, for every Apple fan, boy, there's an Apple Hater.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.160]   It's got a balance out Merlin.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.200]   It's got a balance out.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.640]   I'm still I'm waiting.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.000]   I'm not convinced on the iPhone.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.640]   I really am.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.360]   I'm not.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   There's still people saying that about the iPod to Leo.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.360]   Well, they're wrong, obviously.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.120]   There's no question.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.160]   Yeah, but I mean, I think about all I think about some of the really cool things that I do
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.320]   in my Windows mobile smartphone right now.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.040]   And at least 70% of the stuff that I do that I enjoy is based on the fact that I can put any
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.000]   file I want on it and download any software I want on it.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.600]   So when I finally do get my iPhone, that's one thing I'm really going to be looking at,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.640]   because if it turns out to be a huge, hellaciously library managed device,
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.760]   where I can't put anything on it that iTunes doesn't want to put on it,
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.880]   that would be a big strike against it.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.440]   That would be bad.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.240]   And you know, I'm having a little email back and forth with a fellow who says,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.040]   "Oh, it's OS 10."
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.560]   And I'm saying, "Well, they're calling it OS 10."
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.040]   I guess really what makes it OS 10, the ability to run OS 10 applications.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.920]   And if it can't run, you know, third-party applications, well,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.000]   that's what makes any operating system an operating system,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.320]   the ability to run the applications designed for it.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.720]   That's not true.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.000]   I mean, if it's a kiosk, it still has an operating system.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.320]   Right. I mean, that confuses people into thinking that when we're talking about
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.680]   OS 10 applications, we're talking about Macintosh applications.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.360]   iPhone will run OS 10, but it'll run iPhone apps.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.560]   Although there is going to be a lot of commonality in the code.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.280]   I keep trying to play my, you know, do my Jedi mind tricks to try to get developers to
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.920]   tell me exactly how people inside Apple just tell me exactly how closely this code will
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.480]   be compatible.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.680]   What makes it OS 10?
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.400]   The fact that there's shared code libraries, the fact that there's shared
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.640]   development systems, the fact that core animation, the exact same system that's
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   using to do all those cool animations in the leopard is the same stuff that's being used to
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.560]   do to drive the exact same displays, the exact same animations on the iPhone.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.000]   It's not a case of, well, we're using a consistent level of hooks.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.880]   And if you learn about how to use core animation on the desktop,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.400]   you will have some consistent information that you can use to learn how to use it on the iPhone.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.280]   It is, as far as I can tell, exactly the same thing.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.480]   Well, but that's core animation.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.000]   There's a lot of other facilities of OS 10 that may or may not be present, right?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.640]   Right, exactly.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:31.080]   And the key phrase is just that once again, this isn't a Macintosh, this is an iPhone,
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.880]   but they are all running the same core operating system.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.800]   The fact that it doesn't need to, you know, know how to use a mouse, doesn't make it not
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.080]   OS 10.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.520]   When you look at the run up to this and you look at all the people who are, you know,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:51.000]   trying to attack it, it strikes me that it does sound, taste, smell, and look a lot like
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.560]   everything I heard about the iPod when it launched.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.680]   So that's where I'm kind of basing my position.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.160]   I'm reading right now Stephen Levy's book, The Perfect Thing, on about the iPod,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.280]   which is actually a great book.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.800]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.480]   And it's really interesting to go back five years.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.120]   I didn't realize this, but Windows XP and the iPod were announced within a week of each other.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   It is a really great job of tying it all into other events at the industry and other events in the
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.720]   world. There are so many things I just forgot were going on.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.240]   Yeah, putting it in the context is great because you really see where we were at the time.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.920]   And at the time, Job said, this is going to be a category breaker.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.440]   This is going to change everything.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.720]   And I don't think even he knew how much it would change the music industry.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.560]   But it's a different thing with the iPhone because phones are such a subjective experience for
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.600]   every single user.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:44.520]   I keep saying that for me, what makes the iPhone so compelling was that it has a really good
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.320]   keyboard. It's a virtual keyboard, but for me, it's a usable keyboard.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.800]   And yet for so many people, that's going to be the deal breaker.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.360]   They're not going to care how good the media features are.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.920]   They're not going to care how great the browser and the email are.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.880]   The fact that they don't have a tactile keyboard attached to it,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.720]   or the fact that it's not the size of a candy bar, or the fact that it's not a folding phone,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.040]   is going to be a deal breaker for so many people.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.640]   You can't really own the phone market the way that Apple was able to take over the portable
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:13.160]   media market because so many people have so many different ideas of what a phone means to them.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.920]   It's like buying a car. You can't sell one car to everybody.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.560]   You have to go into categories. There are people who are never going to buy a pickup.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:25.960]   Well, I think the argument is they don't have to do as well with the iPhone as they did with
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:31.240]   the iPod, relatively speaking. I just mentioned the iPod in terms of the naysayers said nobody
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:36.920]   would ever spend that kind of money for a device that plays MP3 files that are locked into this
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.520]   system when such a small capacity. I don't know if that's analogous, though,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:46.280]   this is a pretty different-- I mean, for one thing, he was going into a market that was not nearly
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   as commodified as the phone market is. I'm not saying-- It was a nascent. It was a brand new market.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.520]   It was an up-and-coming market. And although it was somewhat mature, there were people who were
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   but it had matured in. Here's the interesting part. It had matured. It wasn't mass marketed.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   Well, in a way, the people who wanted MP3 players knew where to get them for cheap.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.480]   Let's put it that way. Or if you were a power user, you were prepared to pay a lot. Maybe that's
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:13.240]   similar to what's happening with phones right now. But I don't think it's completely now.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.720]   And I think just to say this once and get it out of the way, I think when people like me or Andy,
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   whoever say, "Well, let's wait till we actually see what it does." That doesn't mean we're hating
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.680]   on the iPhone. It's not digital. I wasn't speaking about you.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:29.720]   Right. No, no. But I mean, to just say that anybody who doesn't accept this as the all-time
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.920]   greatest device they've ever used before they've ever used it doesn't mean anything.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:38.760]   I don't think anybody should do that. In fact, I'm just trying to counter the flow from the John
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   Dvorak to the world. But they have a stronger case to make because I mean, it's vapor.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:51.000]   On the market and in somebody's hand, I think the naysayers actually have a lot more legitimate
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.560]   right to say stuff. It's all traffic from my blog. Let them go. It's fine with me.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:02.760]   That ability, that ability to run apps. I'm not nearly as on the ledge as I was in January,
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.320]   but I still really think to myself that even stuff like dashboard widget type functionality
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.560]   that can hook up and sync with the apps that I use, that for me, I really think,
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.360]   unless this is that much better than what I already just paid a few hundred dollars for last year,
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.400]   I got to say, if I can't run apps, it's so much less attractive to me.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.440]   I'm already really, really decided that I'm going to be buying myself an iPhone,
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.880]   chiefly because it's the first phone that I've used that has a browser and an email client,
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.240]   and even a phone features that seem to work the way that I want these things to work.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:42.120]   All Apple has to do to create a brand new transforming product is to create a phone that
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:49.240]   just plain works. Again, I love my Windows Mobile smartphone, but at least twice or three times a
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.880]   week, I have to go and do some farming inside the file structure because I'm trying to answer
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:00.040]   the phone, but they'll tell me, "You're starting to run low in space. Please delete unneeded files."
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.880]   I said, "Yeah, but can I please answer this phone for my mom who might be sick and dying right now?
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.360]   Thank you much." I've had my Windows Mobile phone freeze in the middle of calls. It's awful.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.320]   Unfortunately, it's not just Windows Mobile. It's just about every phone I've used has some
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:19.000]   really just idiotic thing that any engineer who stepped back for one day and thought about how
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.720]   a phone auto work would have solved really, really quickly. If Apple sells me the first
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:35.240]   trouble-free phone I've had since 1998 when I had my first, my first huge shoe-sized phone
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.960]   that doesn't do anything but place and take calls, they'll have to achieve something really,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   really important. For every feature that the high-end users like you and me don't have,
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:54.120]   they'll be people who go, "Wow, I can actually surf the web and see a real webpage." I can look
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.960]   at this voicemail thing and see who's calling me. All it's going to take, like you said,
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.840]   it is subjective, but they need a couple of million people that think those things are cool.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:10.120]   High-tech geeks can go ahead and buy the Nokia phone, but they'll just have to have the battery
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.360]   charger with them at all times. I see exactly what you're talking about. We skipped over
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:21.640]   something earlier when we were talking about Apple giving no DRM, counter DRM opportunities to
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.200]   independent labels. Remember, rewind a few months ago when Steve Jobs first published that letter
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.120]   and we're saying, "Oh, this is just like a marketing ploy. If they could do this, how come
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.600]   they're not allowing independent labels to release stuff without DRM right now?" Then two months
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.880]   later, "Well, actually, guys, that's what exactly what Apple is doing right now."
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:44.120]   Which your blog post saying that you were wrong. Oh, wait. Oh, look, a kitten who's been trained to
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.360]   eat limes on YouTube. I'm going to link to that instead. Okay. Well, that's entertaining, I suppose.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:55.480]   Well, but they're so sour and it's so cute when the kitten... Lime kittens. Oh, I love that.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   All right, we're about the war. Here's a kitty with a hat on.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.560]   Citizen journalism, ladies and gentlemen, citizen journalism.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.360]   Let's, Andy proposed, and I think it's a good idea, a new feature. We're going to do
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:14.360]   old but still good products that you're using. I guess this all started with your visit to a
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:19.000]   flea market. Not just any flea market, Leo, the MIT flea market.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.960]   Ooh. Every single month, the Massachusetts, on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.560]   Campus, there is a flea market where every geek, nerd, Dobbyn, whatever word you want to use,
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.480]   we didn't play sports in high school. We're emptying out our closets. Exactly. It really was
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:42.120]   quite wonderful. There was a guy who had just a huge box full of 2001 era NEC mobile pro 790
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:49.480]   handheld PCs. This was a Windows mobile device where the step one of this design was, let's have
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.560]   a PDA with a full-sized keyboard built in. Okay, we got it. So what does that imply? Well, if it's
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.160]   going to be that big, let's put in a big screen, like half the size of a VGA screen, it'll just
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:02.680]   be narrower. It just looks like a really big checkbook, but it has a Microsoft Word built in,
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.480]   it has Excel built in, it has Explorer built in with secure connections. It has a compact flash
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.720]   slot, it has a PC card slot, which means that for this $10 purchase, I have a mobile word processor,
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:19.080]   I can put in a doesn't have Wi-Fi built in, but hey, look, it's got a PC card slot. I went into my
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.520]   closet, got my old or an Oco gold PC card, slide it in there, download the drivers, it works just
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.560]   fine. It gets 10 hours off of a charge. I can simply copy, I don't need to use ActiveSync or any
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:33.480]   other buying cables for it. I can simply, when I'm done with my word processing, I just save it as
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.720]   a rich text file on the card. I'll tell you, they knew how to make computers in those days.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.760]   You know, they ran on to what you're doing, but still, weren't you calling Leo a geek a few
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   minutes ago? How much just? Let's just send this up. How much RAM does your mobile Pro have?
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:55.960]   It has 64 megabytes that share between internal storage and memory, but it's big enough that I
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:01.320]   can do an entire chapter off one of my books. It's also narrow enough that because I am not
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:08.760]   a member of the 1984 USA Women's Olympic team, I can't use like a 50-inch laptop and a coach class
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.000]   seat, but I can actually do word processing on this. It's almost nearly a full-sized keyboard.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.080]   And now I got a great deal because I go to the MIT flea market, but I went to eBay because I needed
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:24.360]   a buyer replacement battery for it. And you can buy these easily for anywhere from 40 to 100 bucks.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.880]   And for a lot of people, and also, you know, I was, I was,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.280]   the color screen or is it black and white? I was color screen, all of 64,000 colors.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:38.440]   It also, it's also very, very nostalgic because it has that old like non-super twist LCD. So if you,
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.120]   it has windows media player built in, but if you were to try to play video on this,
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   again, it's sort of like when you try to Skype in from your phone there, it's like there's a
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:52.840]   eight second delay in what it wants to draw and what it draws. But for just, I just want something
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   that I can word process on, something that I can just surf the web on more, more importantly,
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.280]   something so that if I get it caught outside in the rain or if I leave it behind a taxi cab or
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.720]   if I'm, if I'm covering a space launch in the desert where all the dust is blowing around,
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:09.000]   it's not going to be a big deal if I cheese this $80 computer, as opposed to choosing a $1,500
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.400]   MacBook, that would be a bad thing. I think if I still have my model 100, I'd probably still use
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.000]   it. Yeah, that's, that's very much in the same way that I did. People, reporters love the model
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.240]   100 because it was absolutely indestructible in a rain forever on a set. It had a real keyboard.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:28.200]   This has kind of a real keyboard, right? Yeah, it's if you laid it in front of like your existing
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:34.040]   MacBook, you'd find that the, that the, the, the, the alpha numerics are nearly the same with as the
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.000]   alpha numerics on your full size notebook keyboard. I can, I can touch type on it very, very easily.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.360]   Anybody else have old crap they're still using? Are you talking about the Radio Shack WP 100?
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.400]   The model 100. Yeah. That's what I was going to mention. Yeah.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:53.560]   You still have one? I have an operating Radio Shack WP 100. Oh, what a great, oh my god,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.520]   there's that a classic. And I can tell you something that's quite similar, this thing called the Dana.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:04.760]   I don't know the Dana. Just Google Dana portable and it's very, very similar and I have one of
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.160]   those which is it more modern or is it the same era? It's got, it's got Wi-Fi. It's got, oh,
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:14.520]   it's the Neo. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's very, very good. It weighs like a pound.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:19.640]   You just plug it in via USB to something. It goes, but I still have a working WP 100 and
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.800]   every journalist I know, that's what they carried around forever. Oh, yeah. You're bad.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.600]   So that was actually going to be the thing I suggest. I have one that works. Wow.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.920]   Just Piliy O, if you get the right price. No. No. It's just fun to look at it because I do
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   remember how great those were. I mean, they really were fantastic. Merlin, do you have any old
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:42.360]   technology you still are in there? I'm trying to think of old devices. Now, if we're going to do
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   devices. Could be software. It could be software. Well, when you, when you mentioned this, I like
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.200]   this idea. I, and I didn't have a lot of time to think about it, but the first thing I did was
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:56.600]   went to my applications directory and sorted by date modified. And, and the oldest app I've
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.800]   got in here, I haven't used in a long time, perfect guitar, which I think is a guitar tuning app.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:08.760]   The second app, second oldest app, modified on 32602 and I did just go check on Mac update.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.480]   It has not been updated. It's a. Yeah. And it's, we've, I think I might have talked about it on
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:20.360]   here before. It's a little application called noise. And all noise does is generate paint noise
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:26.440]   and white noise. And I have a very, a friendly family of, of Wookiees who live upstairs. They're
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:36.040]   very nice people. But very nice people. But sometimes you just need to concentrate and.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.080]   I thought you called them Bigfoot Merlin. I did not say that different.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:45.560]   So you're saying that they discovered the podcast. We're going to fix this in host.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:50.840]   So noise is not been updated in years. No, you do. You open it up. It doesn't need to because noise
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:57.880]   never changes. It's got, it's got a button and a volume, a slider. And the button is noise.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:04.840]   And when you hit it, there's noise. Now, if you, are you able to combine this with pizziz?
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:10.680]   And when you turn it off, it gets turned off. And then there's a coupon code to it.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.600]   That's it. I'm having trouble hearing. There's some kind of a static noise coming through my cans.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:21.240]   Kind of noise. Is it pink noise, white noise, purple noise, hyper choice of pink noise,
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.400]   or white noise? The pink noise, if memory service is, that's what I have it set on. Let me look.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:29.480]   And what if the guys at Pizziz were able to put this in as a feature as part of Pizziz,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.240]   then you don't need one app. I'm going to buy you five new bits for Christmas.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.560]   The, and so the pink noise covers, I expect white noise is more of kind of just the
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:45.960]   hissy noise, but the pink noise covers some of that low end as well. It's free as in free.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:50.520]   I think it should be. And no, but it's such a great little like old school app, but it's,
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.760]   it's a nice way to cover it up. But you know, you got me thinking now about the whole idea,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:01.880]   though, of these old devices. And you know, it's funny. I look at my, my trio, my, I believe
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.760]   totally up to date trio. And I kind of say there's not that much stuff. I do check my email on here,
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:12.200]   and I like, I like the keyboard, but there's not that much stuff that I'm doing on here that I
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:15.800]   could not have done with my Palm five. That's probably true. I mean, I'm trying to think right
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.080]   now. I mean, I'm probably being a little bit, I mean, I like the obviously the connectivity stuff
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:24.200]   is, is really great. But in terms of just having Dan, you know, data stuff to lug around with me,
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:29.400]   it's, it's, it's really, it's, it's fascinating. And I don't know, I, I think it's a very interesting
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:33.800]   topic, though. And we find the duo show just on kind of these old devices that still have
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.200]   terrific use. I got one right here. Listen to this here.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:49.800]   In the back zip. Oh, wow. That is zipper. Yeah. No, it's just the leather, the leather case.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:59:01.880]   Holding, holding my beautiful message pad 2000. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby. Yes.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:08.760]   It's a Newton. I do want to buy that from you. This is, and it's in pristine condition,
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:15.960]   because I gave it to my mom. It's got a two megabyte flash storage card and additional cards for
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.360]   some other games and so forth. Let's see what else do I have here. It's got the keyboard.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.480]   The Newton, the, it's got a keyboard, which is a proprietary Newton connector, not USB.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:31.800]   They didn't have USB in those days. 1996. This thing had two PC card slots. So I also have a
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:37.720]   fax modem card with X Jack. That was a man. Yeah. You got the whole thing. Oh, this is,
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.880]   this is a work of art. Let me tell you, runs on a, on double A batteries.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:48.840]   That's so cool. I still am. Here's the stylus. You see, and beautiful metal stylus.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:55.240]   This is honestly still the best PDA ever made. I cannot use another PDA the way I used to use
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:59.400]   the Newton 2000. As a matter of fact, I have, whenever I'm covering conferences or doing
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.320]   talks like that, I will have like a spiral bound notepad in my pocket, which I refer to
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.440]   lovingly as my Newton message pad 2007. You have to, as you as useful as the other thing.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:14.360]   That if, if Scully hadn't forced jobs out just before this came out, if jobs might not have
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.520]   made something out of this, yeah, you know, this is a scully ear about the corner.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.960]   Yeah. Do you, you run this? You can run this in wide mode. Yeah.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.520]   Oh, these photos, I just sent you guys. It's got great handwriting recognition. It's, uh,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.680]   well, relatively great. I mean, I'll be honest with you. It's as good. It's as good as anything
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.360]   out now. You know, and it, and it has better, probably better. And it was smart too. I mean,
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.560]   you would, you know, it's kind of stick it reminds me a little bit of my Newton because you would
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.240]   write a date or, you know, lunch with Merlin and it would know who Merlin is and it would
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.720]   know what lunch is and it put it in the right spot. It made the one of the best first impressions
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.040]   on me ever because I went to the launch event and even then I was still using notepads and just
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.360]   writing notes myself and I had to take conference things. So handwriting computer, it looks like
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.280]   a little notepad of paper without even thinking I write a note and then without even thinking I
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.440]   do the same thing I would do like on a real notepad, which is just draw a line underneath that to
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.800]   note to myself. Okay. That's the end of the note. And then it just percolated for three quarter of
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.240]   a second and realized, Oh, I guess that means that that's the end of the note. I'll format a
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.640]   new one and I'm like, uh, it's pretty, you know, I have to say when you look at tablet,
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.560]   PC, Microsoft, Saba, PC, there's a lot of Newton in it. Uh, nice leather case. I wish there were.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.480]   There may be more, maybe more. And he's like, it's like, this thing is, this case is so old,
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.240]   it actually has my business card in it from ZD television productions. Wow. Leo support
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:38.360]   technical managing editor of the site, MSNBC. So that means this is 10 years old.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.560]   They're right. Something else is so awesome about the Newton. I still have, I still have it like in
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.440]   my storage locker here above the cabinet inside my office here. Whenever I put fresh double A's and
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.280]   it's on all the day, my entire life circuit in 2000 and here's restored immediately. Still
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.760]   in here? Yeah. This is like a hundred bucks on eBay. I will, but you know, I will bring this the next
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.000]   time we do that. So I mean, I'll just sure. Yeah. I'm just checking. There's still people doing
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.640]   development for it. There are people who will learn it. You can run Linux Apache on it. Bring
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.320]   it down to the studio. Leon, I'll buy it from you. Well, I'm not gonna sell it, but I will bring it down.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.440]   You're welcome to play with it for a little bit because it is, it is a world of life. If you decide
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.280]   you want to sell it, I want it. Okay. You know, and this is an actual Newton leather case. It's got
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.040]   the little Newton like bulb on it. You're killing me here. You're killing me. No, here's one. Here's
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   one. It's a Newton 2000 plus message pad 100 plus accessories. It includes a buttload of
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.520]   accessories. Oh, I want this. Yeah, it's pretty neat. I'll be honest with you. I know Leo took
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.560]   care of his probably. Well, no, actually what happened was I gave it to my mom and she never
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.640]   figured out how to use it. So she put it in a closet somewhere and I was there when I was there
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:47.800]   a few months ago. She said, do you want this? And I said, mom, mom, that's great. You saved it.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   I'm so pleased. It's like she gave you back all the comic books you had as a kid. It's like,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.720]   yeah, I didn't throw them out. They were propping up the dining room.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.520]   I was just joking. Here's that. Do you really want that? Honnis Wagner baseball card? Because
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.240]   I still have it. It's here. I just, you know, I thought it was a line. And number one Superman comic.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:11.080]   Yeah. I know I told you about if you fail to mow the lawn, but I'm not that without awful.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.920]   So anyway, it's just it's fun. It is fun to go back down memory lane a little bit. And some of
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   these things, it's interesting, maybe not useful, useful. But but in many ways still as useful and
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.360]   certainly works. I mean, you look at the Newton, that is that was a work of art. It really was.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.400]   I admire people though, who are willing, unlike me, who are willing to put a lot of effort into
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.760]   keeping that stuff alive. I think that's kind of cool to go. You know what, this does what I
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.640]   needed to do. And I'm just going to go. I'm just going to use it that way. I'm a fetishist.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.240]   Yeah. I want the shiny thing.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.720]   Because a lot of these things are still perfectly useful. One of the things I've discovered,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.600]   I really liked about this mobile pro, was that it's a form factor that got completely abandoned.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.000]   Right. I'm kind of sick and tired of how every single hardware manufacturer seems to think that's
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   around 1989, maybe 1993, they perfected the art of computer design. Keyboard plus big screen
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.480]   folding keyboard plus big screen on your desktop. That's it. We've reached the
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.200]   acme of hardware design. We don't need to keep trying out new things. So when you find something
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.040]   that's a little bit different and a little bit more useful for the way that you interact with
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.720]   your hardware, I mean, it just, you like it even more than you should like it just because, my god,
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.920]   here's, you know, here's something that's different. I want to wrap this up because I know Merlin has
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.800]   to get out of here. Real quickly, do you still want to do some software picks gentlemen? Sure.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:33.080]   Why don't you start off, Merlin, in case you have to run? Yeah, that's okay. I'm fine. I forget where
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.440]   I, I forget where I learned about this. I want to maybe say life hacker, but somewhere along the way,
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:44.520]   I've used this before, but you have a situation where you've got more than one machine and you want
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.880]   to share a keyboard and a mouse. And the easiest way I found to do this is this program called Teleport.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.440]   And it's a Teleport and it's a free preference pane that you install on two machines. You identify
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.520]   the machine that acts as the server and then you allow any other machine you click on a little
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.680]   button to share this machine. Then you just drag, this is probably not new to a lot of people,
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.920]   but it's new to me. And so then you saw on the host machine, the server machine, you then drag
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.200]   little versions of the screen, kind of like you wouldn't displays. You drag the screens around
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.400]   and it automatically detects the edge of the screen when you move across and then pop right over to
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.200]   the other machine, which in my case is my power book or excuse me, my Macbook Pro, sitting next to
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.000]   my screen. So it's, it's completely natural and you can sit there. It'll do things like if it's
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.600]   under a megabyte, it'll move the clipboard with it. So if you're watching YouTube in one screen and
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.120]   you want to drop it into TubeSock on the other, it'll carry it along with it in the clipboard.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:45.800]   It's just, it took like a second to set up. It works great. It's got encryption. It can detect
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   other machines through Bonjour. And it's a great little free app. And if you've, you know, if you're
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   like me, you've just graduated from a laptop back to a desktop, it's a great way to keep that old one
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:59.640]   used through the day and to have a second monitor, monitor effectively. Very cool teleport.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.240]   Teleport and I'm looking at the Mac update site. I'm cheating, but it's at an abyss, excuse me,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:13.800]   abyss soft, I guess, A-B-Y-S-S-O-F-T dot com. And it's very cool. Very cool. Andy, you got a pick
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:20.200]   software pick you'd like to share with us? Yeah, a little bit off the wall. When I give presentations,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:25.000]   I'm surprised at how often people compliment me on my choice of fonts. I don't know whether
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.920]   that means I really wasn't very interesting in terms of my actual content. But your typefaces
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:34.440]   are amazing. Exactly. Well, if I'm talking to more than like 300 geeks, maybe one of them will say,
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.480]   you're using Comic Sans, but somehow it doesn't suck. What did you do to it? That would be saying
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.800]   something. Exactly. And I said, well, no, it's not Comic Sans. It's this really, there's this really
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:51.480]   great font library from comicbookfants.com. It's a company called Comic Craft that they actually
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.320]   produce, in addition to fonts for geeks like us, they actually produce the digital fonts that DC
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.880]   and Marvel and all these other companies really, really use. I want these. Real Comic fonts,
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:07.240]   not Comic Sans. Oh, look at these. Oh, these are cool. They're absolutely gorgeous. I use a font
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:13.400]   called Hedge Backwards. That is just beautiful. It looks like it was hand drawn, but it's so
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.200]   metric that it's really, really easy to read from any distance. I use it almost everywhere on my
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.760]   websites, on my letterhead everywhere. I just love these fonts. Now, the great thing is a lot of
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   these fonts are really dirt cheap. You can get them some packages for less than 40 bucks. Now,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.960]   here's a reason for you to go into iCal and set yourself an appointment for New Year's Day.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:39.480]   Every year on New Year's, every single font in their library is the number of pennies in this year.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.240]   So next year, every font will be $20.08. Even the ones that cost you 140, 150 bucks.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.360]   What's the email? Comicbookcants.com.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:54.920]   You know, I'm looking at Hedge Backwards. It is that that that Marvel hand-lettered
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:03.960]   comic book. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Oh, I love this. It makes you look a little bit rowdy and a
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:10.280]   little bit out there. It looks like an adventure book for boys that kind of hedge backwards look.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.800]   Yeah. And there are at least two dozen of these kind of different hand-lettered fonts. So you can
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.200]   go for whatever sort of effect you're looking for. This is the Hedge Backwards is, like I said,
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.600]   it's a little bit metric, meaning it's very, very precise. The other cool thing is that
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:29.640]   in the lowercase fonts, on some of the typefaces, it's upper case only. Hedge Backwards is upper
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.880]   and lowercase. But if you choose the upper case only font, when you hit the shift key, the O will
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.880]   be a different O. The A will be a slightly different age. So it'll look hand-lettered like you get
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.400]   some little variations in how it's being drawn. It's the best 20 bucks I ever spent, even at the
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.320]   full price is probably the best money you'll ever spend on a font. Well, it's a neat to cite too,
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.880]   because they have interesting articles like bouncy text and gradients and illustrator and
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   how to do rough balloons. So if you're doing comic books, I mean, obviously these guys do comic
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.840]   books. Right. Exactly. I mean, again, if you Marvel DC letters are using these, exactly these
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.280]   fonts to letter all their stuff, you will see this stuff on the covers of just by every book you've
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.160]   been. It's not the prices are not really too bad. But I want to buy a CD with them all. Do they sell
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.280]   one with everything? You can buy the whole Shmoegula. It's going to cost you, but they do they do sell
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.520]   font packs that have collections by theme. Like if you want those really cool blam suddenly,
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:27.320]   Thor smites his mighty hammer upon the ground, those big display fonts, you can get collections
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.880]   of those for like $120, $130. You will use them if they're on your hard drive somewhere. They will
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.920]   be a point at which you're doing invitations to a cousin's funeral service. But yes, you will do
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:42.120]   the Thwa-Gadoom Don Martin font because it's just too cool a font not to use. Chris Thwaak.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.880]   Kurt Thwaak. I love it. We need to eat that. These are great. Hey, thank you for the tip.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.520]   This is wonderful comic book fonts.com. I want to mention something that you know,
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.880]   I mentioned I GTD. And by the way, I've still been using it and I found it to be a very useful to
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   do list getting things done. I'm still free I GTD. And I mentioned that on a few episodes back.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.480]   By the way, they updated very regularly. So there have been quite a few updates since I mentioned
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:17.720]   it. I'm still using it. It sinks beautifully. It's really fantastic. But Frank John, when I mentioned
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:26.840]   that, he's frank.tumbler.com said, you know, thanks for the I GTD. But let me show you another one
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:33.160]   that is for students. It's called School House. It's from Logan's Collins.com. Have you seen it?
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.320]   Yeah, it's totally cool. I think I might have had it as a pick once. Oh, did you?
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.800]   Oh, never mind then. No, no, no, no, do it. Do it. It's for doing your school work.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.040]   It's a homework manager. Oh, it's totally cool. You should do it.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.760]   The kid who wrote it's 19 years old. Maybe that's where Frank, you probably heard it on
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.640]   an earlier Mac break weekly and forgotten, sent it along to us. But it keeps track of your grades,
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.680]   it keeps track of your assignments. It goes term by term. Do this week. Very important.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:05.640]   It even has something it calls class casting, which allows you to use dot Mac sync or FTP
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:13.160]   to put stuff out so a teacher could add stuff to your system. I would think a school,
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.000]   this would be a great thing for a school to use. So you did this. I mustn't have been around
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.200]   when you did it because I could be wrong. I know I mentioned it somewhere, but it's not.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.040]   It's a great little and it has a really if memory serves, it has a really nice sense of
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.200]   finish to it. Yeah, it's really really very nicely done. 19 year old kid wrote this.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.480]   There's an ask instructor button that automatically opens an email with a question about an assignment.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.600]   Instructors can use it to push assignments as well. So if all your students had schoolhouse,
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.440]   you could push the assignments to each of them. It is free, although they ask the developer who's
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.280]   again, 19 years old asks for donations. Actually says donations are down, but you can send me an
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:57.400]   email instead. So it's a really good beer. Yeah, well not beer, but near beer. Logan's
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:03.480]   Collins.com. Well, I'm sorry to do a repeat, but I think for anybody who has a student,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.040]   I told my daughter and son about it immediately. I think it's pretty impressive.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.920]   Oh, what did they say? They downloaded it and I haven't yet used it.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.960]   I think they're afraid of actually getting anything done. So that's, you know,
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.840]   they may not really want it. That's not cool. It's not cool to get anything done.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.000]   No, both kids are really working on organization. That's kind of one of the main things you learn.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.360]   In school. I would just think, you know, I mean, I didn't care for computers at all when I was
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:38.040]   in school, but I think with my brain of today, I think, gosh, I kind of wish I'd had a framework
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.280]   like that in like college. It could have saved my life. It just, yeah. I mean,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.840]   that's the nice thing about getting things done though, is that whole idea of thinking
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.200]   in two different ways, thinking about your projects, for planning and thinking about
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.720]   context, for doing. And that just that concept alone would have been so much better for me to
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.200]   know earlier rather than later. Maybe I'll sit down with my kids and say, hey, let me just work
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.880]   this through because you may like this a lot. Actually, I should send it to the Sisidman at
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.400]   Abbie's High School because they all use a max. Has Shubi seen it?
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:13.160]   I don't know. Shubi, get this. You need it. Shubi's a straight A student. Shubi's one of those
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:19.240]   scary kids who does 8,000 things and is brilliant. We call him America's favorite sophomore. He's the
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:27.800]   High School sophomore who helps us out at the Twit facilities. And now finally, last but not least,
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:35.480]   a pick from Mr. Scott Borne. I've been the victim. I've identity theft two times in my life.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:43.080]   Oh, dear. And recently all this talk of, you know, vulnerabilities on the Mac has me scared. So,
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.640]   I've started using a product called Netshade. And with Netshade, you can protect your identity
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:55.080]   because basically what you're doing is you're using a web proxy. And people don't have to know
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.320]   where you're from. You can make it look like you're logging on from Switzerland. And there's a free
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.840]   trial available from Rainier software. I tried it out. And one of my big concerns about this was
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.960]   going to be that it was really going to slow things down. But generally, I don't see any
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.880]   performance degradation. And so when I'm doing my banking or different things like that,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.960]   just just in case, I don't know, maybe I'm not actually helping myself, but it makes me feel better.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:26.680]   So I'm using Netshade. Netshade. Now, does it ever worry you that you're running all of your
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:32.920]   most secure stuff through a company server that you don't know about? Thank you for helping me
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:39.080]   ruin my day. You're still alive. You're submarine, Scott. Allow me to poke holes in your boat.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:45.720]   Okay, I'm just now going to go kill myself. Then my work is done. Another good pod.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:51.160]   Podcast guys. You know, it's going through other people's sites anyway. It's just one more site,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:56.200]   big deal. And I'm sure Rainier, whoever he or she might be is perfectly trustworthy.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:06.280]   Okay, never mind. I'll pick something else next time. We love you, Scott. We just trying to protect
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.800]   you. Don't jump. All right, since this is the world's longest podcast and I've got some severe
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.520]   editing to do over at the beginning there, I think we're going to wrap this up and save our wines
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   about I cal for another day. If you guys don't mind, there always be plenty more.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.040]   What was that came from? Want to thank Annie and I go from the Chicago sometimes for joining us.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:32.200]   A colossal waste of bandwidth, his website, C W O B dot com and anything else you got coming up,
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.920]   you'd like to let people know about Annie? Nope, I got me an iPhone book. I got me a leopard
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.200]   book. Both these things got to be written and both these things have just been delayed.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.400]   How can you write an iPhone book? Are you actually or can you reveal those details?
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.720]   Again, it's one of those Thomas Edison things. My genius really cannot be constrained by limits
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.160]   of AC and DC current, which is why I must slap I must smash Nikola Tesla and his horrible,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:02.200]   horrible, beat Nick ideas. So in that for Nikola Tesla, you read David Pogue and I don't know.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.440]   Anyway, it was a very nice person. I love David.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:12.200]   And you can of course catch Scott Bourn's Apple phone interesting stuff at Apple phone
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.400]   show dot com. I want to say tricks because the other ones are tricks.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:24.760]   And I life zone dot com is his podcast and podango dot com is his company. And someday soon
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.080]   we'll be at the Padango studios and doing this show and no profanity will be allowed in the
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.920]   padango studios. Also Leo, Alex wanted us to mention that Pixelcore has a coupon sale.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:41.880]   P X C 50 is the coupon. If you want to go and get some cool software for 50 bucks for something
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.800]   or something. Absolutely. Yeah. Well, no, no, the way it works, you can join Pixelcore for
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.920]   that's right. You can join my 50 bucks all summer for one 50 bucks fee, which is that's much
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   cheaper than usual about one 20 one quarter of the usual amount. So P X C 50 is the coupon code you
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.960]   need. And since Alex is in Africa, I'm mentioning that for him. I, you know, I should have mentioned
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:07.800]   that that's why Alex is on the podcast today. He's in Harare Zimbabwe and couldn't get access to
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.880]   bandwidth to do the show with us. But he I'm hoping we he's going to be going to South Africa at
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:18.680]   some point. I'm hoping we can get him on the line via Skype from South Africa. Merlin Mann is
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:25.640]   working on the Merlin show every day constantly. How's it going? Oh, swell. I'm getting ready to
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.960]   do some more tutorials, some more screencast going to do some stuff about smart playlists.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:36.280]   And actually my I really I really like the series. It's running now talking with John Roderick from
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.560]   the band the long winners. It's a lot of fun. So yeah, doing that and that's and spending way
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.480]   too much time playing with the tumble log. I need to like get some kind of a I need some kind of
