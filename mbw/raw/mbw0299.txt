[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   I'm very bad news
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.480]   Also here is this is weird. This is strange Alex Lindsey is in town and I'm not the bad news either
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   No, he's the good news in town. I'm in town
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm in town today for a rare appearance. Yes
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.560]   We really I really was preparing to write you off of Mac break not because I want to because I love you
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.800]   But because you're gonna you work like out out of town all the time. Yes, but no, but I'm
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.160]   Good I'm working on getting back in that's a good thing because you have a business. It's thriving. It's yeah
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.600]   Some people may may or may not know I think they know about pixel core
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.960]   But one of the things pixel decor does is video production and you've got clients that are just you know
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.520]   You've got production all over the world now. Yeah, we're doing six to eight streams a week a week
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.960]   So I'm just one of the teams, but can't you like teach other people to do what you have?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   We have this is more important. It's I know this doesn't I know you only make
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.680]   50 bucks or whatever, but this is more important we have other teams, so there's actually
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.080]   About six teams that are doing stuff and so but I'm one of them
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.700]   And so I'm there certain events that I that I go to that are though some of the high profile ones
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.160]   Don't you isn't one of your spin-offs has a great start worst name?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.600]   Well, the one way other companies is rebel unit rebel unit
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.840]   So we love that we well I was part of that you know when I was at ILM
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   I was part of the rebel Mac unit so that was that was really the name of our little division
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.680]   So so that's where that's where it came from also here from the cult of Mac and
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   Leander Connie
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.360]   Hey, he's he's a Mac person first and foremost
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.680]   Full-most right absolutely great to have you Leander. Thank you for having me again
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   So the bad news is this is Eileen's last day and last
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.920]   Last show that she's gonna produce for a foot network, and so that's really sad
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720]   We love our lien and she's going away, but it is an excuse to drink heavily. So that's not so bad
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.400]   When are we drinking? What is the good?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.600]   Begin
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   I know you have to show
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.280]   My last show behind the board so yeah, we'll be popping out that bottle of whiskey you asked
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.000]   I asked put away behind me. It's always bittersweet when employees leave we've had employees, and I'm sure you have to
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.560]   Lander and Alex. I know you have no employees out and he's so
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.000]   But I but I'm sure you can imagine it's always sad when employees leave
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.560]   But it's always bittersweet because it's also happy for them and she's she's got a great new job
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.120]   She's she's going to work for Molly Woods always on which is going to be a very hot show for CBS
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.400]   And so that's exciting are you the executive producer? What is your um, you know, I'm supervising
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.080]   Produce your young you're doing all the work Molly gets all the glory. That's how it works. Well, that's how we're sure
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.720]   Is the star she's leaving actually come to think of it now I understand I should have given her some glory
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   Did you give me a show? Oh, that's right. That's not that's I always forget to mention you're not leaving us entirely
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.760]   You're gonna continue to do all about Android every Monday at 4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern 5 p.m
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.440]   I never will get that time right as I don't know why anybody would work at 5 p.m
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   That's um, you know cuz it's a party at the end of the day is what we think it's the end of Monday
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.800]   We often get fed cupcakes and cake at the end of the show cool reason so yeah
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.400]   well anyway, we'll miss you and
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.520]   Mostly what's gonna happen is people are gonna miss the fabulous organization you brought to this
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.920]   It's back to the old way folks
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.840]   Sorry
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.640]   Sorry, oh, I'm sure it'll be fine. You did the show long before I ever came on. Hey good news
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.800]   Mac news we have Mac news and well, we knew this would happen so Intel's IV bridge which is a
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.960]   I said 22 nanometer. It's a new process
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.720]   Version of sandy bridge that is gonna be very good for notebooks and but now the ivy bridge processors out
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960]   But the mobile part is not yet out
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.720]   But we think it'll be out next month and of course as a result all sorts of announcements Lenovo announced a bunch of new
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.200]   Ivy bridge based notebooks. It is absolutely gonna be I mean this is this is not this is speculation
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.440]   But I think it's gonna be the case that there will be new Mac books, right? We hope to man now
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:06.160]   This is if these rumors are true that we this here is a speculation from 95 Mac that it will be ultra thin
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.000]   USB 3 which is in my opinion a bit of a capitulation from Apple and
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.960]   Most importantly I think for most of us a retina display. They don't say what the resolution will be but
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   They're saying mind-boggling etc. Etc
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.560]   I mean I think that it's hard to say it's hard to release a new laptop with USB 2. I mean I think that would be
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.920]   Well, it is in the windows world certainly
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.720]   But thunderbolt my friend your favorite technology. What about it? They're gonna this is rumored that this one will have two of them
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.640]   Two thunderbolt connect so it'll have which is huge because one of the big things that we have we have trouble with is that we want to connect
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.400]   to end type thunderbolts to our computers and
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.560]   We can't do that so which means that they only have one connector and you don't want to really pass through the thunderbolt
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.240]   Makes sense when you're passing from drive to drive when you're passing real equipment to each other like video interface boards and so on
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   So forth you really want to pass through them and so so having two thunderbolts on the other side
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.840]   I think make a big difference. I think that thunderbolt is still
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.600]   There's a lot of problems with USB when it comes to there's no way to get video
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.520]   You know IO mean in the same way that thunderbolt is set up or I think that it was a lot faster
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.000]   It has less. Well, there's no question that thunderbolts better
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.380]   You know technically but it hasn't been the adaptation adoption has not been huge not in them not in the consumer market
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.880]   We're very pricey and Apple charges 50 bucks for a cable and nobody includes a cable
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.960]   I mean there's just all sorts of like negatives USB 3 was kind of the windows
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.640]   Alternative that ever so I say it's a capitulation only in that Apple is tends to be purest
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.040]   And I'm sure wants to promote thunderbolt and say you don't need USB 3 now
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.520]   The good news is with Ivy Bridge USB 3 is free because it's built into the chipset
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.640]   Yeah, so that's probably why they're including it. Yeah
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:01.320]   I mean this is at this point for app if if they are including those processors for Apple to deliberately leave USB 3 out of the device
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.360]   That would be sort of just being petulate and sort of being it
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.600]   Yeah, then don't want to give you a and as we know Advil is never petulant
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.840]   Exactly there their their lower lip is always just fully out there not to never they're never fighting everything like that
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.280]   No travel it also the 95 9 to 5 Mac report also says also
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.440]   Theorizes that it's not going to have a built-in Ethernet port
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:30.520]   And so if that is the case then a high speed USB 3 Ethernet adapter is going to be pretty much required
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.480]   Gonna spend a hundred bucks for a thunderbolt solution for that and nobody's gonna
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.200]   No one's gonna be satisfied with USB 2.0 speeds on over Ethernet one thing
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.240]   I will say is I hope that they have a USB 2 connector because there are yes
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:51.240]   There are compatibility issues with USB 3 we ran into it yesterday at an event where devices aren't working with the USB 3
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.720]   You plug it into the USB 2 in there right is rain
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.360]   So so that's still there are some compatibility issues with USB 3 with some devices
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.960]   And so hopefully they'll they'll give us one of each lander. What are you hearing about these rumors? They seem
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.280]   credible
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   Oh, sadly, yeah, yeah
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.040]   Everyone's got rumors. It was a lot of people were reporting this independently ABC News us
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:21.000]   Joanna Stern had the story at ABC News, but she didn't mention it mmm sunday when she was on twit Joanna
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.960]   Koopa nice devil scooplet
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   The most interesting thing about the 9 to 5 Mac report was about the
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.760]   The resolution of the the display the retina display
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.520]   And there's been a lot of speculation that you know they they would be doubling up
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.560]   And the resolution of the current screen just the way they've done with the the iPad and the iPhone in the past
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.520]   But they were gonna
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.920]   It said in the report which is and and it was really strange that apple was going to drop
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.160]   Actual numbers they weren't going to refer to it as a 1080 you know 1080 by 768 screen anymore
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.680]   And the screen was going to be called, you know good better best and optimal or something like that
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's the the resolution that was kind of resolution independent was the idea yeah, which I didn't quite get did you understand it
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   No, I was gonna ask you
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   It says source sources familiar with software strings i'm reading the 9 to 5 story left behind an OS 10 lion and mountain lion beta say
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.680]   This retina display macbook pro features multiple
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.080]   Retina resolution modes so users are able to adjust the sharpness and image sizes
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.040]   To their liking my my my guess the long awaited resolution independence is upon us. What is that?
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:34.200]   Because there's an optimal resolution for every lcd screen there's there's to match the dots, right?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.840]   My my guess is is that one of the things that it made do is attempt to keep the perceived
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.920]   Size of the text the graphics everything else the same when you change from resolution to resolution so instead of
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   It changed the people they changed the ppi right
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.360]   Uh, but the scale of your text that's a big problem like you
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.960]   It's a huge problem you get a super high res screen all of a sudden all the icons are texted
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.240]   Right so if this if there were a consistent text and and i can't say and you're just making it clearer or less clear
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.080]   And then you're deciding on your own whether you want to zoom in or zoom out choose less clear
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.760]   If it's all the same size it might be because you're interfacing with an external video device that can
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:21.000]   Work at the same resolution so if you're if you're gonna hook it to a 720p device or a or a 1080p device that you know
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.680]   It's funny to say 1080p will be lower resolution half the resolution of your uh, uh, um of your
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.920]   laptop, uh, but you might have to if you're gonna mirror those you might have to go to a lower resolution to make that work
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.680]   That's my i'm completely making this up on the fly just case anyone
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.840]   Yes
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.680]   That's one area i don't really understand i mean
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.120]   Having a retina
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.280]   Retina great resolution is a really big thing when you've got a phone you've got an ipad something
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.320]   It's gonna be like a held um held close to your face or a device because it's absolutely unmistakable
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.080]   And i'm going i'm switching back and forth between the new ipad and the ipad too
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.280]   For a project and for the first time in my life the ipad too looks like it's got crummy resolution
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.880]   Yeah, i'm looking at it so closely
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.800]   But when i'm working with uh an iMac when i'm working with a 15 inch notebook
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.960]   It's far enough a way that it takes a good look to see exactly what display resolution i'm actually in
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.840]   So long as i've got the the screen what matters isn't actual resolution but screen real estate
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.800]   There's a certain minimum that my you know because i'm equipped with human eyes
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.240]   I'm really not going to see the difference between this display the cost
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.920]   Uh me an extra 200 the one that cost me a little bit less money
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.120]   Yeah, you're running at arms length with a monitor
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.400]   And traditionally higher resolution has always meant exactly that and even more
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.200]   More tabletop more desktop so you can get more pages on there
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.640]   It hasn't meant
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   CRISPR because it's already
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   Retina at that distance you don't see dots at that distance right well i mean i think that i think isn't that what retina means is that you don't
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.240]   You cannot resolve the pixels at the normal viewing distance but the normal viewing distance of my laptop right now
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.720]   I can see the pixels. I mean when i'm looking at this. I mean, you know i can yeah, I can definitely
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.200]   I can see that they're especially around curves
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.800]   You can see you know the thing that's where you're gonna see it you're not gonna see it through the straight lines
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.720]   But you know you can see and the thing is i think that what's gonna happen like what happened with the ipad
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.480]   Is that as soon as we um see a retina display on a laptop?
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.720]   We're gonna look at everything else and feel like it looks like a low resolution so so
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.400]   Admittedly, that's what you'll you won't see i don't think you'll see pixelation or artifacting everything's gonna look
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.280]   But everything will look crisp that's what we've seen with the ipad too
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.160]   Right big question is is everything gonna work
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.280]   Because that's a squeam resolution dependence is a much much bigger deal on mac OS than any of that i'm uh than the mobile operating system
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.400]   And secondly i mean everybody at this table has spent enough time
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:49.080]   Having you're giving a talk to like 500 people and you've got exactly six minutes to put your laptop down on a podium
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.680]   And get it to work with whatever projector though the rasa and in look but in there
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.480]   And so man alive that's the point where i really want to be able to say here is the actual pixel resolution of this screen
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.680]   Because the the tech guy in the room is telling me here's what you should set it at i'm not going to tell them all should i set it at
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.480]   medium best resolution or
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   optimum resolution oh no wait
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.160]   I wait there's another setting here called wonderful should be a wonderful resolution
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.480]   This is somebody the chatroom point out. This is apple the new dumbing down right of
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.680]   It's like it's good better best. You don't need to know the dots
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.600]   I bet you that i i'd be highly surprised if there isn't some kind of advanced setting that lets you just put in this is you know
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.960]   So what's the resolutions that we have i think that so what they're insane?
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.160]   Okay, and it's by the way a lot of these rumors come from what ivy bridge is capable of
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.080]   I mean i think that's really what's happening is people saying well there will be an ivy bridge notebook
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.560]   Here's what it's capable of and and and one of the things it does have a much better
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:50.680]   Built-in GPU and you couldn't do screen resolutions on a laptop with the gpu's that they had right up to now
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.920]   um
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.600]   I think also this but what what what's what's confusing and this may be one of those apple things like oh
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.680]   We're going to do something different is this notion of it's uh independence like
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:09.800]   But I think we got I think i've nailed it which is that the the dpi will be adjusted the pixels per inch will be adjusted
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.440]   And what they've obviously got and I don't see that here, but I bet you they have is a really good scalar in ivy bridge
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.880]   Right that will do the upscaling the problem in the past. I remember in the earliest days of of digital
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.640]   Displays if you didn't display it though exact right resolution. It was really awful when it's still soft
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.360]   I mean if you go to an odd resolution on your laptop, you're gonna see
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.840]   But it did get better and I think it got better because of scalars built into these I would guess built into these screens where
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.960]   Correct me if i'm wrong, but this is what happens in high def television where it can upscale and match the res the resolution you want
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.160]   And do artifacting or whatever it's doing to make it look better
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.760]   Maybe they've got better scalars in here. So they can say hey, you don't have to think about resolution
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.600]   Yes, there is a native resolution on this display, which is very very high
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.800]   But you get to pick what you want and it's gonna look almost as good
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.680]   No matter what and I think for the average I mean again for us
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.320]   We're like we need to have a specific resolution, but I think for my parents
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.840]   Them just knowing that it was going to sharp or you know like good better best is really all they need to know
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.400]   But it shouldn't there be higher expectations for a machine that costs 1500 bucks
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.080]   When in the window space, I love the fact that there is a 650
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.880]   Laptop and there's a 750 dollar desktop that there are some trade-offs involved
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.240]   But i'm not saying you're settling for less because of the price but you feel as though
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.680]   You don't you don't have to expect the moon from this thing apple sells nothing but super premium
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.640]   Product that's if the 15 inch notebook is going to be like the the machine that it replaces
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.440]   It's going to start at about 1500 bucks and go above
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.800]   $2,000 for that amount of money for that amount for I really have a I have a right to expect an ethernet jack
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   I have a right to respect
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.320]   Expect everything. I mean
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.760]   We're just a in that that trip to Dublin at that conference
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.240]   So I know the speaker traveled with his macbook air
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.280]   And he thought that the hotel Wi-Fi was going to work
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.920]   It didn't and the fact that he had internet access for the whole week was due to the fact that I happened to have brought with me
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.320]   An airport express without that he would have been
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.920]   Stucked to a trip to the apple store for 30 bucks for a adapter
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.760]   He probably already has for 1500 bucks for 2,000 bucks
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:20.200]   I shouldn't have to go to the apple store for another 35 dollar adapter for a basic thing that every single windows notebook that cost more than
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.600]   $350 has built in I
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.760]   Think we're going to see it's interesting because we are seeing already the the Lenovo does not have the new Lenovo
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.880]   announced today does not have an ethernet port and I think that might be an ivy bridge issue. I don't know
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.200]   Um, but of course you've apples air has come with a ethernet USB to ethernet adapter
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.680]   Yeah, we have and also at least with the air is at least you feel as though you're getting something in exchange for the lack of ports
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.200]   You're getting a really really nice light really really super slim display
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.320]   You're also getting a macbook cost 999 bucks, which by by mac terms is really really cheap
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.560]   And also I just think I just think people do I think you're right. Andy. I think people want an ethernet port
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.800]   But if you get this thin
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:09.160]   You know, it's a form factor issue that the ethernet port already doesn't fit goes right from the top to the bottom of the air of the
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.440]   MacBook so you make this any thinner you there's no room
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.040]   One thing that we run into over and over and over again now is that we have to we're dealing with people's connection issues all over the
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.520]   Way I know that by the way the firewire is the same
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   Firewires go. I think firewares gone as well. It'll be gone. But the um the
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.600]   We deal with connections. Go ahead. Keep talking. We deal with just hold this up to the close-up camera
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.440]   So people can see how close how close the tolerances are now and if you get any thinner you're going to be out of luck
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.480]   Yeah
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.840]   But the
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.000]   The thing is is that we deal with people's connections all over the world and one of the things we find over and over and over again
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.280]   Is there's a lot of people now?
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.920]   I mean probably 60 to 70 percent of the people that we have they don't even know where their ethernet ports are
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.440]   Like in the house. I mean they you know, they're using Wi-Fi
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.920]   They're using you know, so we expect that but I again
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.120]   Uno's doing they're off a but a USB 3 dock
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.840]   So that if you need that now apple never will do a dock. I mean they've learned the duove
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:12.200]   The big difference here is though remember that in Lenovo is just one manufacturer of many that makes windows machines
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:19.080]   If I really want a machine that has an ethernet port, you can certainly quite a threat apple is the only purveyor of Macintosh notebooks
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.640]   And if they realize that we're all going on conjecture on what 95 max seems to think the design of the new 15 inch macbook
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.800]   Pro is going to be but if it's if apple suddenly says nope, we're not going to be
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.000]   We're not going to sell any mobile max that have a built-in ethernet port
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.400]   We're not going to sell any mobile max that have a feature a feature b feature c
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.560]   Suddenly you're saying if it's well if it's only 10 percent of the people out there who want a hardware to the net port
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.080]   Why are you zit? Why are you Zorching out 10 percent of the power users who define the use of this machine?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.440]   But I think it's
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.240]   I think apple would have to go really make a hard turn to the opposite direction and say we are
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.520]   Explicitly saying we are a consumer electronics company
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.640]   We realize that there's a market for high pro-end machines, but we are no longer interested in that market
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:10.760]   I think that for a long time app go ahead later. That's exactly the point though. I think it's not they're making consumer machines
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.320]   They are not targeting
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.480]   although I guess you know
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.040]   They want to make they want to have the biggest market possible. I know in the past when they've dropped ports. I think Phil
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:26.600]   Schiller came out and said that they they looked at the numbers and only you know 10 percent of users were using this port
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.560]   So to them it made no sense to accommodate that that 10 percent
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.480]   And it's something like a dongle is a good is a good compromise
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.200]   And I think I really think that when I what I think when I'm trying to think of what apple's going to do next on a lot of things
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.440]   I think 90 90 what will 90 percent of the people need 90 percent of the time. Yeah, and if it doesn't fit into that
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:48.280]   I think it's high it's highly unlikely that I mean I think that that is the direction apples going whether we like it or not as power users
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.000]   But I think that when we think about the direction of that
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.920]   I mean they're gonna look at what 90 percent of the people want to do 90 percent of the time and if it doesn't fit into that
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.160]   You know and I think that we're very quickly seeing hard-line connections to computers
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.560]   Not something that that you is impossible
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.440]   But something that we're gonna give you an extra dongle to manage because you know
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.880]   This is not what most people are gonna do
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:12.360]   We're not gonna build an entire chassis an entire workflow and and build the entire computer for something that a small percentage of people
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.000]   Gonna use we're not taking it away. We're simply saying that if you want to be one of those special people
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.480]   Um, they're gonna need a dongle
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.800]   I mean they could the same argument can be made for the iPad right?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.640]   They could make a they could make a pro iPad that had all these different connections in it
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.480]   And there's no way they're gonna do that because they're looking for
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.960]   The one device that fits everybody's the most people's uses. Can I just say though? Don't we all really really want this?
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.720]   Oh, yeah, like yeah, are we gonna really say no? I'm not buying it has no reason that port
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.040]   No, I wanted it's beautiful if it's that thin
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:48.200]   With a retinitis play and two-thun of all so I mean it could be missing a keyboard and I would buy well that's
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.000]   I just I just don't want to I
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.400]   Am I imagination? I'm plotting the curve out beyond the next two months, right?
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.000]   And every time you say we're gonna we're gonna take 90% off 90% off 90% off 90% off
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.240]   For you to leave behind 10% of the functions of a machine
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.080]   But pretty soon you're left to a machine that's worth about zero right and we could
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.600]   It's again as I plot the curve out into hyperspace
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.720]   I can really see a time when again two years from now when a year or two from when I need to buy a new
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.160]   A new notebook and I have to say well here's what apple's willing to sell apple is selling a machine
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.920]   That's good for 60 70 80% of the people out there
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:35.720]   Unfortunately, I've got basic day-to-day needs that will that that this design does not serve and because apple's the only company that's making these computers
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.360]   I have to switch to windows now and windows 8 is a very good and plotting out in the future
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.240]   Windows 8 is a very good very stable operating system
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   That's very very useful very very secure
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.520]   And the fact that I can actually get the machine that I want and I feel as though there's a company out there who cares about
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.040]   Every user out there and not simply so you're an edge case screw you
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.880]   And I don't think it's already happening to me because I am actually now whenever I look at an altar book
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.240]   Not for when I'm I I test it with Linux
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.960]   I want to see can I run Linux on this thing Linux Linux because I don't want I'm not going to go from a Mac to a windows machine
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.520]   But I would go from a Mac to a Linux machine. I want to have I want to have a Unix operating system under the hood
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   It's all nuts
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.440]   You know to be honest, I'm looking at my Mac book pro and I'm thinking this is probably the last
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.720]   Notebook notebook. I'm gonna buy that may be the case
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.160]   I move into the iPad. I want to move every maybe the case. Yeah
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.560]   If you want proprietary computing, there's nothing that beats the iPad and apple is moving basically Andy
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.920]   That's what's happening apple's moving you into a proprietary computing sphere
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   And I think that I think that not opening computing the right of the ports
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.080]   iPad is tailor made to be as thin as possible as light as possible and as inexpensive as possible
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   So that's and that's you I'm getting something in return for giving up ports
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.760]   Again, if you're if you're trying to get $1,500 $2,000 out of me
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.320]   You don't the answer to the question. Why doesn't have this feature isn't oh screw you you're an edge case
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.120]   It's no I can give you the names of 100 people
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:10.840]   I know that's a really but and if you're if you're telling me because we are design aesthetic says that oh we want things
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.800]   They're a little bit slimmer. Well slimmer does not make it doesn't mean that this thing now floats
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.680]   And it hovers behind me like a balloon. I still have to carry this 15 inch notebook. Yes. Yes
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:26.760]   So why are you making it slimmer just for the point of making it slimmer if the cost of that is that you're making it less useful?
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.160]   This is the but this is the talk about the 10%
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.280]   This is the 10% of apple that absolutely drives me nuts time and time and time again
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.440]   Well, I know it's a given purely aesthetic and style decision that absolutely makes a product worse
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.720]   I think that welcome to the apple world
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.680]   I think it's always been that but I think that apple constantly focuses on I mean I think there there is a there is a
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.760]   High value at apple
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.200]   Uh for being able to say no to things. They they say no to things all the time. They're constantly shaving on the edge
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.240]   No, but we're like no to no to what I'm saying is that they that there's there are um, you know
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.680]   I've heard stories of them spending a hundred million dollars on development of a product that never comes out because they decided the very end
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.920]   This isn't the right time for it or this isn't the right whatever
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.800]   I mean they say no to a lot of stuff and what they're saying no to is that this isn't something we want to continue to engineer for
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.320]   You know as as part of the device and I have to say as a power user and I think I'm I fit into the power user
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:25.080]   Um group. I mean I 17 inch laptop is about the minimum that I that I can use I usually carry two of them with me
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.920]   um
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.200]   That what they've added theoretically if that's what they've added
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.520]   Um is more than enough for me as as power user two thunderbolt connections in a usb three
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.840]   You know the thing is is I think as a power user I might I might quibble over the the ethernet
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.160]   But I'll buy that thing in a heartbeat. I'll buy two of them in a heartbeat
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.800]   You know the thing is is that it's it is and so I think that they are still satisfying what power users want
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.960]   Maybe not they're aiming at the broad middle. It's a bell curves power some power users are going to fall off the side
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.800]   No, no power. You're some of them. Some are
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.520]   I mean, here's the deal. I disagree. I think somebody's gonna want ethernet somebody's gonna
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.240]   You know, I mean, I know but are they really gonna go to windows over ethernet?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.800]   I mean the thing is is that uh, okay. Yeah, because I
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.960]   Not just ethernet, but when you combine price ethernet other functionality that apple may be stripping out
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.240]   It's what Andy's point is I think is very well made is it snowballs
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.320]   I guess the question is at some point where it's like
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.840]   Because the thing is is that if the power users are video producers
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.720]   Which is a large portion of the power users are max
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.680]   Um, I don't know who else needs needs a big machine
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.760]   Um the when I go when I work at a facility and I show up at facilities and I show but a lot of them every week
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.920]   Um, you don't see they're all using pieces anywhere. They're all you know, it is died off
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.960]   I mean, there's a handful of them every time you see them you're like wow. They've got a pc here
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.000]   How do they use that?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.560]   You know, like it's like, you know, and how do they integrate equipment with it?
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.640]   And the thing is is that that's pretty funny really?
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.960]   Oh, yeah, you're like look at it like what am I supposed to do?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.320]   How do I get windows to work with this? Oh, no, it like yeah, I had a
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.200]   Very that's a bizarre transition
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.000]   Like what am I supposed to do with this? Like I have this I have this video hardware
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.560]   And I don't even know how to connect it like I'm trying to show someone how to connect
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.120]   Um, something to do a video recorder. I'm like, I don't know how to do this with a pc, you know, and and um and uh, and uh,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.840]   And so it's you know, you never see it anymore, you know, and in these broadcast facilities
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.160]   You almost never see it in the airport. I mean now in the airport
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.040]   It used to be you know, you see a lot of eye you can walk over and say hi to someone who had a mag because there was like the two of you
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.600]   Now it's like you see like a handful of aces and del machines every once in a while
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.360]   I that's totally not my experience
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.080]   I I'm an airport and I don't I I
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.720]   It's the the macbooks are easier to spot
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.600]   But I see nothing but delves. I see nothing but aces when i'm in coffee shops or i'm in colleges
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.280]   I'm seeing lots of apples, but I very very much aware that in the desktop in the laptop market
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.160]   That's really really owned by windows at this point. Interesting
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.120]   Anyways, west coast east coast thing because on the west coast
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.760]   Yeah, and that's it here in samas isco. I know that's this is not typical, but
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.840]   It's um, it's all uh macbooks and ipads. Yeah, we're in the bubble. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely not
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.440]   But this is all the uh, but this is a lot of you know, um a
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:05.160]   Players, uh, you know the the cream of the crop the program is the designers the silicon valley elite and um
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.960]   I mean, here's the thing is all the ipads that are coming in. I mean i'm seeing more and more ipads
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.160]   I mean, I we work for a lot of corporate clients and we're we were actually told we were shooting some back behind the scenes videos
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.200]   And we were told do not shoot and this is a big these are big corporate clients
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.240]   We've been told by two different clients. Do not shoot anyone working on a pc
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.160]   Like like, you know, like they would have a deal with apple. No, no, they didn't have a deal
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.640]   They they felt we just don't want to mark it on the hip marketing felt like pcs make them look backward
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.080]   Then that now that now you're explaining why you never see pcs anymore
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.360]   It's because they're being hidden right because marketing says well, that's what i'm hit
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.080]   But and all of the marketing guys all have you know max that well
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.280]   I don't think that's too bad
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.000]   That's a shame that they're driving but they're but they're like they're like, you know
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.920]   We don't want we don't want people to see the other ones because and they have partnerships with some of those community
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.160]   And you wonder why people hate max users
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.600]   Holy cow, but it's it's a very, you know, they're just computers kids
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.440]   There really isn't that much difference
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.040]   And if you need an ethernet port and you want to spend half as much you i think look at the look at these new lonovos
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.280]   They're carbon fiber. They're thin
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.520]   There's a lot to be said for these things
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.320]   We're i'll get one in here and you guys look at it and you tell me in fact
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.040]   I got the del over there
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   Is anybody in my office?
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.680]   There's i'll show you the del it looks gorgeous and it's you know, I just think that
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.200]   Apple's going after the fat middle more and more which is really funny that apple's going
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.600]   Because they went from being the three percent to the to the fat middle. Yeah
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   This is this this now this is clearly in del del and the hp and everybody say no no no
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.480]   We had designs like this before this is clearly
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:43.400]   A macbook air right? I mean except it has a plastic actually this is carbon fiber bottom
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.840]   Um, but you know look at the keyboard very much influenced by the air backlit
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.640]   Uh, one thing that they've done differently is that this is a 13 inch in a in a form factor
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.080]   That's much smaller than the apple is there. Can't is this camera any better than the old dels
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.800]   Uh, I don't know probably not but who knows
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.720]   Uh, you know what even that mac camera isn't as good as the c 9 10
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.320]   Oh, no, no, no, but I'm saying but the dels like if I get on a webcam with someone now
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.560]   They look like they're in 1950. You know, I know the doesn't a del camera. That's nice. This is gorilla glass
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.720]   It's almost edge to edge. You can't I it's I guess I can't i'll turn it on if I can but um
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   It was almost edge to edge. So it really feels like a nice big screen
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.280]   And uh now by the way, no ether net port so I don't
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   I don't know if this is a win. It does have what's interesting is display port
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.200]   Um, and it's a display. Oh, it's not thunderbolt. It's not thunderbolts many display port. It does have a usb 3 on it
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.960]   Um, maybe the battery and then look I think I've used a bunch of the novos
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.760]   And those are great those new linovos they didn't ask today. Look anyway, this is mag break weekly
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   But I think this is to defend and these point which is all on it gets harder and harder
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:53.480]   All I'm saying is that apple has the ability to define the entire universe of
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.600]   An entire desktop platform that if they if they keep going for the middle of that bubble for right and they apply that to
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.440]   Every single machine that they make I get I get asked all the time. I'm I needed a notebook. What should I get?
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.480]   I'm listening. I'm thinking of switching from this to this for a desktop
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.600]   We might I don't want to go back what what i'm saying is that i'm not really criticizing apple as much as i'm saying
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.960]   I don't want to go back to those dark dark times 10 or 15 years ago when I had to tell people that well
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:27.720]   Uh max are nice, but they really don't do everything and you might find yourself in a situation in which you really really wish you'd bought a pc
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.760]   Or something that was a little bit more capable because apple really isn't making flexible machines that are good for
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.680]   Pretty much anybody in any situation. They're they're they're built for people who really just want to do the web
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   Just want to do microsoft office want to send some email funny snapshots of the grandkids if you want to do more than that
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.560]   Ooh save yourself $800 and buy something from aces
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.520]   I don't want I don't want to ever be in that position whether it's next year or 2015 or 2020
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.320]   And that's again as I keep plotting that curve out
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.360]   I see that as one of the possible names on the gravestone the screws sees the from the christmas
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   And I think that might be possible
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.800]   But my only argument will be is that is that the machine that that is rumored
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.760]   We're just talking about a rumor here, but the machine that's rumored right now
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.240]   There is going to be no production
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.800]   Mobile production platform that is better than that machine. I mean tooth underbolt cables
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.600]   USB 3 cable a USB 2 cable, you know those you know that that that machine
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.040]   With a retina display there's not going to be anything on the market that comes
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.080]   So we can look at the trajectory and maybe it doesn't have an ethernet cable
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.440]   Maybe it doesn't have firewire, but there is going to be I mean every production person
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:37.080]   Who needs a real machine in the field is going to be using that machine if it if it comes out as specced in that in that rumor
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.160]   Well anyway, it's incredible
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.920]   Whatever just the what's true is that this new macbook looks beautiful and we will all have one
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.880]   Within a month of its release because it's gorgeous and and maybe we'll bitch about the lack of a ethernet port or something
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.840]   But
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.200]   We're all gonna want one. You know more of a firewire is more of an issue for me than he's I'm concerned about the firewire, but but I you know
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.880]   USB 3 solves a lot of that because a lot of the machines
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.680]   You know, I won't be able to hook my cameras anymore, but that's yeah
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.320]   I mean, this is more of an issue in the long run by me
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.280]   But that's you know and it's hard it's hard to sit at will should have three different high speed data connectors
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:18.360]   On the same frame so they have to cut the cord just as they did with SCSI leaving us with a bunch of useless drives
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.200]   They're going to do with firewire leaving us with a bunch of useless drives
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   You know actually most drives now have USB so if it had a lot of them have USB 3 if I mean that fast you actually the reality is a lot of
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.920]   These great little drives that are cheap all our USB 3 and we can't use them because they're not
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.400]   You know because we don't have a machine
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.320]   We're to take a break come back with more. There is a new update to OS 10. We'll talk about it
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.440]   It's a security update that's fairly significant, but first we're going to talk about go to meeting
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.920]   With HD faces which now works on your iPad and I love it shoot
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   I was I left my iPad at home. I was going to do a meeting on the show today next time
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.880]   Because I want you to see how how beautiful the HD phase we did a go to meeting yesterday
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.240]   Uh, and we had it was great. I think what let's see one two three
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   We had seven or eight people in there you get up to 16
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.920]   In the video and for some reason it formed a pyramid and I was at the top and I liked that
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.200]   That's cute. I have a screenshot of that. I will share that with you

[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.040]   kind of a must-have
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.160]   Just this public service announcement brought to you by me
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.320]   10.7.4 is out came out a couple of days ago
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.520]   um
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:12.840]   This is a weird rumor. I'm not even sure maybe I'll ask lander because you have to deal with this apple insider
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   Says that apple isn't talks to acquire the german television maker luva
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.440]   or luva
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   I think it's luva
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.080]   loewe we
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.080]   Luva says
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.480]   Nothing to it absolutely nothing to it
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.920]   um
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.160]   100 30 they even had a price 113 million bid to buy luva
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   Which would absolutely confirm this itv rumor
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.520]   Yes, no, maybe
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.000]   Uh, I have no insight into what they uh into what they heard
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.280]   um, it seems a little strange. I think the problem with the apple tv from apple's point of view is
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.440]   the content and the software and you know making a
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.800]   Platform not not and even maybe even the retail distribution, you know, I mean I think there are reasons to
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.080]   To think they're gonna do it. There are reasons they're not gonna do it and um
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:11.160]   You know acquiring um another high-end tv maker. I don't know if they need that
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.440]   I mean they don't need the manufacturing expertise. I don't think they need
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.080]   Um, the design expertise they look like nice tv's. I checked out the the german
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.440]   company's website and it looks like they're really nice nice nice looking products and uh,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:31.240]   Uh, but I don't see what apple would get from that. I really don't um, you know, I think I think the problem with the tv right now is content and they
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.920]   Uh, things are changing rapidly. There were a couple of stories. Um in the last couple of days in your times about
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.520]   um, how there's a huge demographic shift now in people's viewing plans
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.160]   um people are no longer turning to
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.560]   Um the network tv any longer that everything is coming, you know through the web or on demand
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:55.160]   I know that's certainly true in my household. You know, my my kids don't watch live tv at all and have it be it. Yeah
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:02.600]   Um, so I think uh, you know the question for the apple tv really is is getting all the content partnerships lined up
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.960]   Um and taking care of things like live sports. Um
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:11.240]   I think sports are probably the most difficult thing that they face. Uh, it's not, you know getting
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:19.640]   Nice hardware. It's not getting a retail channel. It's not um, you know having, uh, uh, you know getting into people's living rooms
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   It's it's it's the content
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.440]   So I don't know we have a strange rumor. We it is and it cose falls in the heel of another's bad rumor
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.520]   Which is the chairman at fox con saying yeah, we're gearing up to make an i tv
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   Like what? Yeah, that was that was I think misreported. I mean it had to be there's no way he said that
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.560]   No, no, it's all but I have to say I think I've now having gone to this live a site
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:48.760]   I know the genesis of this live has started the rumor to get all us mac people over here because these are gorgeous
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.960]   They look pretty I want one. So yeah, that was it
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   They started the room. They said hey plant this rumor because then all of these people will come say well
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.520]   What's this and they'll go? Oh, these are this is what an apple tv should look like
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.920]   It looks like a uh an iMac. It's a lot of real estate at the bottom of it. Yeah, nothing like that
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.040]   It's 15 that's a 52 inch display
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.400]   When kind of not used to that they also do uh, see they do the speakers they do all of this stuff
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.960]   So they have a big um
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.680]   They have a big range of products
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.280]   Liffa does and I think that's just totally liffa saying
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.840]   Come on the your apple people should come look at our side because he's a beaut if he's beautiful
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.840]   They they have an ipad app too. Looks like they some of the tv's are controlled by an ipad app which plays a way of playing
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.800]   Okay, I think we got the bottom good marketing good market. That is good marketing apple's not going to buy anybody to do
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.600]   By the way, I want to float a rumor that apple is about to buy twitch
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:52.680]   You'll see in the news tomorrow. Yeah, I mean really that's good marketing
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:41:00.360]   Uh, sorry. I'm sorry leo, but I have to recuse myself from the discussion about any rumors about apple buying quit
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.560]   As I may or may not have access to software. Ooh
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:09.880]   That you saw wag the dog right that's what they did and wag the dog to plant these you know rumors they say
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.760]   I know you know
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.440]   There's absolutely no truth to the fact that law keyed is making a b3 bomber
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.800]   And that's how you plant the rumor there so i'm just gonna say right now
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:24.120]   I will categorically deny it apple is not making a bid for to buy twitch for 130 million dollars
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   I will I will categorically deny that
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.400]   Foxconn says our ceo absolutely did not confirm an apple tv
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.920]   That's not true
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.400]   Terry gao apparently saying the company's making preparations for itv
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.680]   Foxconn saying no in fact terry smart. This is one of the smartest guys in the world
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.280]   This guy created foxconn out of nothing a buck 50
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.160]   And uh, he's not he's not gonna screw his number one customer
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.280]   Yeah, because because i'm sure that working as closely as he does with apple he knows that apple doesn't really care
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.360]   I mean really fine for you to just say whatever you need to say apple won't do anything
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.920]   It just takes the pressure off of them to maintain the surprise for june or july
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:14.360]   And so much of cost it cost money to rent a hall to get the catering done to reject rent the projector
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   Better yet just have a a part supplier announced it for you low-key
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.520]   Few pizza bites, maybe
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.280]   That's a great way to leak it leander had the story we talked about it last week
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.880]   uh
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.400]   That says our source has seen an apple hd tv you want to you want to
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.960]   Tell us any more about that?
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.360]   Yeah, it was a prototype and
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:41.720]   The thing with this source is um, they see a lot of stuff in the prototype stage and so
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.600]   You know, they don't have a hundred percent record a couple of things that um, they've given us in the past
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.320]   Um didn't come to pass or haven't yet come to pass. I'm hoping i'm hoping they stood in the pipe
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.440]   But uh, they said they saw a product type tv they couldn't give me the precise specs, but it was big
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   It looked just like a cinema display
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.400]   Uh, which looked like the the current round of iMacs
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:08.280]   Um edge to edge screen and had a really nice facetime camera that could zoom in right across the room and follow your face
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.440]   Oh, so that sounds good
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.400]   Right so you could do it from your couch. You didn't have to stand in front of the screen like i'm doing now to make a facetime call
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.040]   You can move around and it would follow you around the room
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:23.480]   And it was syri activated the the call was made, um using syri
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.120]   Um, unfortunately, don't know if syri was the main interface for the device
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.680]   Um, or whether it was just used for for facetime calls, but um
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:41.000]   It was really intriguing, you know, it uh, it goes to show i think it's you know that the tv is becoming much more of a two-way medium
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.480]   And not something you just sort of sit passively in front of anymore and it's going to bring you know, facetime video communications to the living room
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:53.400]   I'd be interested to see also whether you know, it brings in sort of full syri like capabilities
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.680]   Um, you know, it's great. Go ahead. I'm sorry
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.160]   I was you know, just intriguing
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.280]   Obviously a lot of the details missing, but um
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   Well, it intrigues me now that I think more about it is that um, if you are indeed in a post pc world
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.160]   Uh, you're going to put pcs in in appliances that are in your life
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.400]   And a tv is a very natural next step you first you have the ipad
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.040]   Uh, but the ipad is the kind of the the
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.280]   A different experience than the tv experience so maybe put that ipad like
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.920]   Capabilities in a tv but you have to consider that it's across the room that the interface you're not touching it
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.040]   So that you have to consider all of that it doesn't now that now that context realized that way
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.880]   It doesn't seem such a distant step for apple if you're getting out of the pc out of the computer business
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   Well, where do you put that?
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.400]   That knowledge that intelligence though the what you your expertise you put it in a tablet
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.800]   You maybe you put it in a tv next when I think that you look at what a lot of people are doing a lot of the time
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.520]   And and the thing is is that there are a lot of people that don't need anything more than what the you know
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.640]   You need more than what the apple tv does all our i'll argue
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.160]   But not not more than what the ipad does right and so the tv to the ipad you've got a great to some
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.880]   And you don't need a desktop omg when we look at the apple tv. I mean obviously the apple tv is an ipad
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.480]   um
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.920]   Core, you know, I mean it could do anything an ipad can do they they're just limiting it
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.280]   I mean, you know, they could open that up to applications or anything else that they wanted to at any point in time
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.640]   But if you have this thing in your living room on the wall, it would be almost like your classic
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:37.880]   um star trek computer, right, you know where you could tell it to set up your appointments and who do you have appointments with and what have you got going on in the calendar for the day and
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.920]   um
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.120]   Fielding calls and all kinds of you know arranging your life. I think
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.800]   Like you say leo it's it's it's a new computing experience completely new and it would make kind of make sense
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.240]   I'm coming around. I've been very negative on the idea that apple might do this
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.000]   But I'm kind of coming around it in if you throw away pcs. Well, where do you put that capability?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.280]   What do you put it in?
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.440]   Well, I had a fascinating story uh christina bonnington their reporter got to see a
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.040]   A prototype television that was the size of a wall. It was made up
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.360]   It was actually made up of six six panels
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.200]   Yeah, but it was much more interactive. So while they were showing a sports game
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.960]   They had everything all the twitter feed from your friends your facebook friends what they were up to what they were watching
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:26.280]   Um, you could comment and and and you know interact with what you were watching as much as you know
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.880]   Just sort of taking it in it was very very much a two-way system. I can see a world and remember
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.080]   uh technologists steve jobs certainly but all technologists are very influenced by science fiction
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.800]   you know even scientists like
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.000]   Get inspired to do the work of their life based on something they read when they were 15 in science fiction
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.280]   So I could very much see I think of ray brad berry's the vell to remember that we're had a full wall screen
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.200]   It was uh, I could very much see a world where you don't have a computer per se
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.920]   You have a big screen in your home
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.200]   Which you clearly you're not interacting with with a keyboard
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.880]   You're using your voice and you have a little screen so that you can leave home
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.400]   I can see a world where that's the that's where computing is in the house in the family and that world is only
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.920]   I think a few years off. I just want to point out that that that that story didn't turn out very well for the parents
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.240]   The vell was bad because they got eaten by lines
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:25.400]   Became a little too real, but you know that but but seriously don't you think that that that idea of one of a wall that is
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:31.160]   A window to the world. It's very high resolution. Maybe not a full wall, but a large screen
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.800]   Uh that you interact with
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.680]   It's an old it's an actually quite an old vision of sure. That's what I've said. That's kind of my point is that
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.560]   Modern technologists are influenced by that those old those tom swiff stories, right?
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.760]   Yeah, yeah, right
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.640]   Well, I mean, you know a few years ago the idea that dicks Tracy watch making video conference calls seemed that outlandish
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   It was a future that was a long way away. And now of course, it's completely commonplace now
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.240]   There's a guy with a nano embedded in his body. Yeah, right?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.880]   But that but that's actually good and that's a good illustration. Usually the science fiction can only
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:10.120]   Visualize the future in terms of what the present is everybody was thinking. Oh, what's what's gonna be the future?
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:15.240]   Communication device. Well, it's gonna be a telephone inside a wristwatch that has a television inside it
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:22.440]   And yet I this has never been an error in which like more people even more nerds are wearing like this plain old analog watches because
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.720]   The future of wearable computing was this tiny little paddle thing that everybody has in their shirt pockets
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.120]   Yeah, we like it my pebble though, then you'll want one
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.520]   And I think that we're really we are moving towards this world where we're not gonna have keyboards and we're not gonna have the section here
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.160]   And we're gonna have you know, I think that we're because I don't you know
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.640]   I think that that was what was necessary at that moment
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:48.200]   But I think that this kind of keyboards are 19th century technology maybe 20th, but they're they're all organized in a way to slow it down
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.280]   They work great. They do work
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:56.760]   They do work as does the mouse, but it's it's not but it is old. I mean, it's it's possible to do better
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:04.040]   I would hope wheels are old, but you know, we're not sure we're not we're not using diamond shaped wheels on our sporty tilly vehicles
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.920]   Are we but think about I mean every science fiction story
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:13.000]   Has a computer you could talk to and you know Andy that once once the wheels go away in one car
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.560]   They'll be gone in all of them in like a decade. Well, and it's a bit of a flow. Yeah, exactly
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:23.080]   Levitation down it's gonna be over hour. It'll happen not because the the new wheels are new
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.280]   But because they solve a problem that unbeknownst anybody else people have actually been worrying about for the past 10 or 15 years
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.360]   Bumps and there's and there's also
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.280]   I'm sorry. I didn't hear that
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:40.760]   But we live in the pot hole capital of america by the way, you're pedaling my soul. He smokes
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:46.840]   Well, we we in boss and we filled that to near stir or drive. So that's how we lost the crown
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.400]   But but hey, when it winter winter
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.080]   Freezes are gonna be happening this we're we have that girl growth get that crown back
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.760]   but it's
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.320]   There there are a whole bunch of technologies. I think that only will work once a lot of people die
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.960]   I'm not talking about armed phaser cannons killing people who are not going to be early adopters
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.720]   But i'm talking about there. There's a there's a whole generation that are just not going to get their heads around a certain basic concept
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.120]   Including folks like me who always define a computer as something that can be that could conceivably do what I wanted to do two years from now
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:24.600]   Not just the stuff that I wanted to do today. And so maybe I am one of those people that I'm gonna my generation has to sort of go into the deep deep deep
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:31.560]   Background before the absolute unimaginable by me generation of computers can actually happen for now. I'm wondering
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:37.240]   Do people really really is society really interested in a tv computer?
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.520]   And the answer to that is they will be as soon as someone cracks this problem
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.440]   But it's not going to be as simple as simply saying let's write ipad apps for the screen
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.680]   If apple has a big success with this is going to be because they really did crack it
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.440]   They found a problem that we didn't even know that we were dealing with until we
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.120]   Was found the solution dropping our laps
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:59.160]   But I think we all know that there's a problem with the tv right now because we have a controller that I have a swap from the tv to the
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.480]   internet to the my apple tv and
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.560]   And we all know that that you know and the question that I have is that one of the ways to crack the content problem is
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:11.720]   Is if does cbs and does cnn and do hbo get to have their own apps running on
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.840]   You know running on this apple tv rather than just netflix
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.160]   You know this this gets back to the all-acart method
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.880]   Which is that each of them can run their own their own video apps and that it's their own little world and it's no longer
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:28.200]   You know what looking the channels is watching looking at all those little cubes that you know are organized by you know
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.040]   Different networks and letting the networks in some ways that gives networks an enormous amount of control it does completely
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.760]   um
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.800]   You know dismember the the Comcast you know cable play
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.960]   But that's why it's going to go hard because these guys these incumbents are not going to go down
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.720]   Well, and that's a big fight
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:52.200]   But then see that but it's not a part of the problem that if you if you approach somebody who say who if you approach someone and who is looking at who is
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:59.640]   Very very well very very well aware of where their audiences and where the revenue comes from and you say that I want you to ignore the
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:05.480]   92.8 of the the pie chart that says people are getting your programming through cable tv
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.040]   I want you to sort of attack that to widen this one little sliver of people
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:15.400]   People who can afford the 500 device that makes this all happen. You're in for the 2000 dollar device
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.360]   So, but I think that the good the good the good companies will see the the importance of you know
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.280]   Making sure that you're you're a good company five years from our 10 years from now so just today
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.760]   But it's often not because these people are clueless
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.320]   It's because you're saying look we're making why would we pirate we make all of our money off of this?
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.440]   Why would we want to jeopardize that with something as simple as innovation?
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:39.560]   Well, the I mean I think that the one one thing is is that is that the again the
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:45.640]   Nump the pure numbers and what apple has proven I think over and over and over again is that the pure numbers of consumers is not as valuable as the
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.320]   Quality of what those numbers represent right as far as as purchase power
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:54.520]   And so the thing is is that one of the things that a lot of advertisers and people that we've talked to when we're working is
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:53:00.440]   They view i-phone users as very very valuable because they're willing to spend a lot of money on stupid things
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:08.360]   And so so the thing is is that like i-phones and so so the thing is is that but that makes them a very valuable consumer more valuable than the average consumer
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.240]   From a from a someone who's trying to sell things
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:17.400]   You know and so so that's something to also keep in mind the other thing is is that I think that you know apple has
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.280]   And you know this is a
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.680]   The rumor has bounced around here and here and there but apple has a hundred million hundred billion reasons
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:29.880]   Why they could decide to really put a lot of pressure on the cable companies if they wanted to if they took the top
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:37.400]   If they started producing some kind of mesh network or something else that that allowed them to provide services to the top 10 markets or the top 20 markets
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.000]   They would they would put the entire cable industry into
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.560]   Cardiac arrest, you know and so the thing and they have and and that's one of the reasons that if you think about why you would save up that kind of money
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.640]   That's one of the reasons that you that I would do it
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.240]   You know not you don't have to take over everybody. You just take the big markets right
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:54:00.200]   We're to take a break. We're going to talk speaking of rumors great article time magazines tech land column by harry
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.720]   McCracken about
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:10.040]   Fact checking digit times. We'll talk about that in just a second. How often has digit times been wrong? You may the answer may surprise you
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.160]   But first a word from fresh books
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:19.880]   Dot com. I am a big fan of fresh books anybody who has a small business ought to know about fresh books
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:25.480]   You know my number one my number one problem with uh with cash flow is what is it invoicing? Yeah, you
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.120]   Sending out the request for money
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:35.080]   I don't know why that's so hard done the work. It's because it's it's a pain enough complicated behind if you're using microsoft word with a little logo
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.520]   And then you have to type it in or well, maybe you got sophisticated. You're using excel and it actually adds it up for you
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:46.680]   This was me until I found fresh books and I am so glad I did fresh books dot com
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:56.200]   Uh it will allow you it's the easy online invoicing app for small businesses will allow you to upload your logo create professional looking invoices
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:03.800]   And then get you paid faster. That's the bottom line. Isn't it go to fresh books dot com and take a look focus on your work
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.720]   Not your paperwork

[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   Understands that getting paid
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.760]   Is is the challenge but you'd young get paid until you send out the invoice one of the things that's cool about fresh books
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.160]   Is it makes it easy? In fact, almost dare I say it fun

[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.240]   In fact, you could do it on the web or on the iphone track the time and hours and then you don't have to manually enter it
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.880]   It automatically sucks it right into the invoice
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:40.440]   Uh invoices are multi currency, which is great for me because I I was working all you know in Canada and so forth
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.600]   It's just great. I could do it in canadian dollars us dollars euro's pounds anything

[00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:00.440]   In the last couple of days that I just loved and I wanted to share both of them with you first of all Harry macrack and we love Harry
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   anyways a regular onto it, uh
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.160]   fact-checking digit times
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:11.800]   and um, you know, everybody knows that digitize was just the Taiwanese now see they have some standing because they are the
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.840]   newspaper of the Taiwanese supply chain, right?
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.640]   So, uh in theory they would be able to talk to all these supply chain people
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.880]   They were the ones who said apple's going to do a 799 macbook air
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.080]   um and many other crazy things
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.920]   uh, but if you if you look
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:41.000]   And then harry did the work so this is totally harry. Thank you in 2006 digit time says new ipod may have wireless capabilities
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.400]   um
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.000]   apple never did do a wi-fi ipod until the ipod touch much later
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.880]   Sources in the passive component industry say AMD based apple notebook in the works. I remember we talked
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.960]   We spent an anordinate amount of time talking about that
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.680]   Still has not happened
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:07.400]   Apple infused sonic to unveil seven sources 17 inch wide screen lcd monitors soon
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.720]   No
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.760]   apple and hp to launch led based notebooks
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.440]   well actually
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.240]   They do uh, I think the I think they got that one right
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.440]   15.4 inch macbooks to begin shipping in second quarter. This was in 2007
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:33.240]   Um, it never did a plain macbook at that screen size apple reportedly to postpone leopard to support windows vista
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:40.840]   Yeah, they postponed leopard, but I don't think they support windows vista to this day
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.960]   NAND flash based ipod video to put strain on supplies as component makers
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.520]   Uh, they did do flash based ipods with video playback
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:58.120]   So that's a good one apple reportedly considering intel platform for iphone. Well, they may be considering it they never did
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:02.440]   MEMS gyroscopes to find their way into smartphones
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:08.840]   A year later they did with the iphone for win tech to supply touch panels for apple netbook
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:16.200]   Mmm. Nope. There is no apple netbook. So win tech never got that work
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:23.640]   Anyway, it goes on micro projectors what they have is very imaginative intern that is sending them emails from an outside ip stores
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.800]   apple tablet pc reportedly delayed until
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:34.120]   2010 with oled model now included it doesn't even make sense
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:44.360]   22 22 inch touch enabled all in one pc in 2010 anyway, so you get the idea
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:50.040]   Thank you harry macraken for reminding us that digitines is more often wrong than right
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:57.240]   So don't get all excited. I was excited about the 799 air because our school I told you this last week you weren't here
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:03.560]   The school my kids go to it. They have a one-to-one computer program and they have been giving macbooks the white macbooks to
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.040]   incoming freshman every year for 10 years
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:12.360]   They can't do it anymore. They're going to lino vote windows machines because they can't afford there is no sub
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.920]   $1000 notebook anymore for metal
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.160]   They can't afford to give mares
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.600]   There's no I thought that well there's no 999 is the cheapest isn't there and the education price. I thought was a little lower than that
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.440]   And I don't think it's much 999 is the education price. Sorry
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.600]   You
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.320]   Kind of depressing I welcome them to the and they told me I said
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:36.920]   Oh, come on when really and they said look with the money we're saving we're taking a half-time teacher to full-time
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.160]   We're adding a new arts program and we're adding six more it folks to manage all of them
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.880]   That's what I said. I said I hope I that's actually what I said. I deeply hope you don't regret this down the road
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.440]   And they will well, we'll see
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.720]   So this is good news, you know at the end of june
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.120]   Mobile me and the biggest thing you'll be losing on mobile me is your your photo albums
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:08.280]   So I have hypothesized that by in fact, I think Andy you did too that before mobile me went
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:14.040]   In a month that apple would come up with some form of iCloud photo albums
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.400]   According to the journal it's gonna happen
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.240]   Photo and video sharing services with iOS
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.040]   six over
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.640]   iCloud
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.840]   I'm sure this is a leak to the wall street journal from apple from within apple that journal quotes people
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.680]   Familiar with the matter. I think this is apples way of saying don't freak out
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.400]   Yes, what is it kind of as a june 30th or is it in 31st or june 30th run?
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.600]   And the the ipad the iOS version of iPhoto also has iCloud
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:52.200]   Albumship the journal the their version of albums is journals right so they already have a way to publish that
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:59.080]   To to your iCloud. Oh that goes to iCloud. Okay. Good. Okay. Yeah, so you can't hand out like a basic open URL
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.600]   That's that other people can access but it doesn't have the sort of controls that you would want to have
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:09.480]   Either that's sort of granularity. You make sure it's not a public URL only people that you've permitted to actually give access to
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.640]   Can actually use it. So yeah, that is something they're gonna have to spackle over there. There's so much transition to nightclub isn't there. Yeah
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:22.360]   Yeah, I think it's gonna be October or November before we can really say that all the components of iCloud are in place
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.640]   And we can actually see the system that Steve jobs was promising a couple of years ago
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:34.360]   One good thing the closed beta of iCloud for iOS 6 now has sinking of reminders in the notes into the cloud
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.800]   Which is good. It's important
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.040]   Yeah, because I do I use reminders for my shopping list right I have a shopping reminder
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.960]   And it's really nice. You tell siri, you know add milk to shopping list is all you have to say. I've never done that
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:53.560]   Oh, yeah, watch. What do you want me to buy? Um some soy milk. Okay, that's bad for you. No, it gives you a grow breasts
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.040]   What
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   adds soy milk to shopping list
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.000]   Yeah, there's
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.600]   And then analog to estrogen is in soy. I don't use soy milk
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.400]   I can add this to your shopping list and reminders and see it says shopping soy milk
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.320]   Yes, please do siri even though it gives you breasts
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:19.000]   And so
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.920]   So let me guess the conference call that that you're on was you're trying to pitch the soy production board on buying ads
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.160]   They said no, all right. I'm a little angry
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:33.880]   So now so now you're trying to keep now you're trying to appeal to the almond the almond milk so a production board
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.480]   Actually, that's what I drink is almond milk is almond. It's an interesting. Yeah
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.720]   I use it for tea
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   Which so here on siri
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.920]   Siri every time every time I do my tea I go remind me to get t in five minutes
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.280]   Well, this is another good thing about siri you can say next time i'm at the tea room
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.520]   Remind me to buy tea at the tea room, you know, I don't do location very often because it burns my battery down
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.120]   Oh, yeah, I'm about as looking all the time. She's looking all the time like is he there is he there?
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.320]   That would explain the fact that i'm down to 10 percent right location based stuff is kind of dangerous with siri
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.360]   Yeah, well, I also have four square telling me it just whenever I get somewhere. Hey, your friend Alex said
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.800]   Try almond milk right?
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.000]   Women almond milk and coffee acts like salt peter
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.840]   I lost salt peter is awesome
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.680]   Mixed with chocolate sulfur
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:30.200]   Anyway
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.240]   Well, how do we get on this? Oh sinking reminders would be a nice feature wouldn't it because then my shopping list to be on my all my devices
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.520]   Um
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.800]   That's the wall street journal. I pretty sure that this is an accurate rumor
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.600]   Not a digit times rumor
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:54.520]   Why would you want to use apple zone sort of you know social networking photoshare anything? Anyway, it's gonna be like paying a big ghost town
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:00.200]   Oh photosharing is different. You know, it's not like you're publishing it to the entire world
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.680]   You just want like your friends and your family get access to it. Right. I was thinking about that
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.520]   Facebook
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.640]   Excuse me
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.320]   Like your friends and family on facebook
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.080]   I don't use facebook and I don't I and I have people who do I'd much rather have the control of saying here's a URL
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.400]   Click on this and you'll be able to see my pictures. I don't I really don't like exposing
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.320]   Even person even family photos to the cloud. I'm it's
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:31.160]   That I actually you're right lander. I share it all the facebook. I share it to instagram and I use path
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.000]   So i'm not waiting. I'm not holding my breath for an apple solution
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.960]   I don't think apple really the point is apple had a solution and they're gonna kill it june 30th
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.160]   And there are people who use it like mr. I and not co
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.440]   We use it a lot or I used to use it a lot and then I try to stop using it because i'm afraid that it'll go away
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.120]   But it but you know just exactly what andy said I don't want to put it on a service
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.840]   I just want to be able to have collections of movies and and there are lots of solutions that can do that
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.880]   They can it was just really nice to be able to do it for my from my iPhoto or from you know
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.360]   Without having to think about it. You know, I like having a seamless connection where I can just build this all out and go
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.920]   I don't want to use some other service actually it's it's but click where click one button here's a URL done
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   Yeah, and the and as you're it's this hasn't affected me, but it's affected friends of mine who have kids
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.840]   They're saying that you know, there's an any group of more than seven people in your friends and family group
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.800]   You want to share something with there's always somebody who hasn't really gotten into facebook yet or they've signed up
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.080]   They've forgotten two years ago and so I have to balance wanting to show pictures of my new baby
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.880]   With two weeks of saying no no go click on preferences
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.840]   And then privacy controls and then click on permit taggy
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.080]   Oh for god's sakes. What if I print them out at the cbs and mailed them to yanthi? Will that work?
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.720]   one other feature of
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:56.840]   Mobile me that's that's down for the count and so far as there's nowhere to have a replacement as iDIS because any do we need iDISK?
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.840]   I mean, we've got drop box. We've got lots of other solutions. Do we need iDISK?
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.720]   Apple apple definitely let that pitch go by
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.560]   It's if they if they had used iDISK the same way that apple was relying on i-club where it becomes
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.880]   It's really an implicit part of the entire math experience. It could have been relevant as it was
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.000]   It was just an expensive piece of network storage. That was too complicated to use
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.480]   They invented they invented drop box. Yeah
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.400]   They invented drop box and then they let drop box take the business
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.760]   Well, it's kind of gone to this the particular apps now though, right?
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.240]   So itunes you have movies and your music backed up to uh itunes match
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.120]   And it stores all the movies you bought
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.160]   in on in the cloud and
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:41.240]   Documents thinking right so you can store all your documents if you if you created them in um
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:47.880]   iOS apps so, you know, it's uh, it's it's no longer one big bucket, but the functionality is still there right?
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.760]   It was drop box. Who was it? It was drop box. I kaleef says no mounted volume versus synced folder
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:01.160]   iDISK you could either have it have it on your desktop and synced it you couldn't mount an iDISK or yeah, you could
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.360]   Yes, you could
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:08.520]   They laid they later on added a feature where you could actually have offline access to iDISK contents by syncing with your desktop
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.760]   Not everybody wanted to have a 20 gigabyte
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.240]   Uh, a whole slice of of their 250 gig hard drive setup. No, I'm not saying I think drop box did it better
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.760]   But they but the idea was the iDISK original idea right exactly and i just had to be
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:29.720]   Yeah, the simple the simple explanation is that drop box that it better by simply saying see this folder great
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.680]   It's the same folder on every machine you use will take care of everything and now google's doing that with google drive
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.600]   I mean it's kind of everywhere so apple doesn't need to do it
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.920]   But it's kind of a shame because they they did kind of own it
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.600]   I'd be very surprised if uh in the first round of third party apps
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.840]   After a 10 point a is released we don't see an application like air sharing that simply says here is air disk
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.040]   Uh that that here here is here is an app that simply uses part of your iCloud allocation
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.560]   Simply as a mountable flash drive that's accessible to your ipad your ipad everything like that
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.200]   Uh or it's or even better something that will actually
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.640]   I was about to say something foolish and say that it suggests that there could be an app in which
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.120]   Individual ios apps are allowed to communicate with each other in a productive way, but of course
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.680]   That's just that's that's that's just crazy juice talk. I'm sorry about that
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.920]   Let's be all that king sugar in there. Have you guys used the airdrop at all?
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.720]   And I use it once yeah
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   I started using it now now I use it in the office all the you sit there look at it
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.640]   Because you just throw something at someone and then they just say yes
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.400]   I'll take it and I don't have to figure out where their folder is I don't I mean I I didn't um
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.440]   Didn't use it until like three weeks ago. And now I'm
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.080]   I was like why didn't I use this all the time?
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.360]   Anyway, it's not good for sharing a single file to multiple people
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.680]   No, no, but like if you want to if it's one to one instead of attaching an email just one to one
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.240]   You're in a work group and I've got you know and we're hearing around you
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.440]   Let me give it to you and I don't have to think about like a shared folder or anything else
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   I can just throw it at them and then they just say yes and pull it down
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   It's it's it's it's much like i-disc it's the seed of a good idea
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:11.320]   You know the biggest problem the reason I stopped using i-disc was because the feedback of how long it took to upload something to i-disc was so bad
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.600]   Because it would just say it would just be it just wouldn't tell you what was happening
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.880]   It would be like nothing and then done. Yeah, and so you never knew whether how much longer am I gonna be connected before it's up there
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.560]   You know and and the feedback was so bad that I just stopped using it because I couldn't figure it out
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.200]   I think I predict you will stop using airdrop for the same reason. It'll be like okay for me for me
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:35.320]   I-disc is really really useful because it's a good way to look at photos and files that were important to me in
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   2006 2007 that's roughly the last time I used it. So that's about the age of the files. We're still in there
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:49.400]   And something else coming to ios6 and do we think ios6 is coming out in at wwdc
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.840]   At least preview preview. I don't know if it's gonna come out, but I bet you it'll be preview
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.600]   That's the time that they would do that they probably talk about 10/8 talk about ios6
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.680]   What would you think ios6 would be the fall for our iphone 5? Yes. Yeah
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:06.040]   They're gonna give it a few weeks for developers I think to get there actually for it right and wwdc is when
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   June
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:15.720]   10th, 12th so next so in a couple weeks we'll find out about it one of the stories nine to five max says apple will have
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.240]   Dropped google maps and do its own in-house
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.760]   maps with incredible 3d mode
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.200]   This is a mock-up obviously
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:32.760]   What do you think about that? I think it's pretty obvious that apples intending to do something like that they bought place base
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.480]   Which was uh, they they bought three mapping companies c3 technologies poly nine
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.080]   And place base they better do it. Well, that's all i'm gonna say. I mean, it's
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.200]   Well, if if if they if they implement this
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.280]   This company's technology the way that this company was demoing before the buyout
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.640]   It's pretty hot stuff. It really is just like having your own
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:57.560]   Helicopter with a gimbal mount a camera that can violate all FAA regulations on every major city
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.240]   And just simply I mean you think you think it's pretty cool right now to be able to go to google street view or to go to bing
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:09.160]   Maps we can go from the bird's eye to the sort of slant. I slant slant angle slant slanted view
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:16.840]   So you can actually see the see the relative the relative position of buildings to to streets. This is truly I want to
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.680]   Walk I want to fly all around this building so that I know that
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:27.000]   When I when I walk from the train station to the starbucks I know that when i'm looking for is this orange sign in front of the bank
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.960]   And that's the point where i have to turn left is really is cool stuff
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:37.560]   See three technologies does this this is what we're talking about. It's they call it photorealistic
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.360]   3d mapping
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.120]   And uh, poly nine is also in three-dimensional mapping so
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:50.280]   You know we talked about this on twit on sunday and and devoreac who's a big fan of the google
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.720]   Maps experience and the google navigation on android
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.720]   Uh pointed out it's a huge risk because as you say andi it's a huge risk because the standard is google
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.320]   So you're replacing something that is the standard that works people like there's no term my turn on the iphone
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.240]   As there is an ankle. Yeah and and already apples and
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.320]   I guess apples in a position of strength because they're in such a position of weakness
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.960]   The one every time I try out an android phone
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.480]   For to write about it and i'm carrying around for the free four days the thing that I always love about it is the navigation because i
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.560]   Is absolutely top notch it's not necessarily because of their access to maps
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.720]   It's just because they put really great software on there
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.960]   Apple could write software like that if they wanted to or could buy companies that make software like that
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.680]   It's just that it's taken them two years now to figure out exactly how to enhance the maps
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:42.760]   Functionality in ios so hopefully we're starting to see them pulling up their socks there and trying to get back into the game
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.920]   Well
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:51.720]   Also, hopefully it's not apple being petulant and saying we're not gonna do anything google dance and so we're gonna do this
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.160]   There's truly saying we're doing it because we can do something better
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.800]   Right and they're probably you know that unfortunately it's probably going to be an ad platform
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:05.960]   Oh, yeah, well it is on google right google's just added the capability to put ads on those maps
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.760]   I think it's crucial. I mean because it's the most it's the most effective way of knowing way
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.800]   You are and what you're looking at and right and also, you know for it's you know the the device now is a crucial shopping device
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   Um, you know, especially for things like tickets events checking in
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:28.200]   More kinds of location based services so they probably want to integrate that into that really deeply into the into the operating system
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:35.560]   Um, so, you know, I mean people are worried about privacy issues now. I think this is going to be a major
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.440]   Um, you know, hairball in the future
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.720]   Um, especially if you know, I think apple makes a step then it's going to be definitely a commerce platform
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:50.680]   What what are your sources telling you liana about the next iphone do is it septice some say september 7th
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:15:00.360]   So to be honest, um, I don't know the uh, you know, I haven't got any uh, any sources about the the release date or what the design looks like
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.880]   We published a room of this earlier this week that was going to be significantly different. Um in terms of uh
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.840]   It's a design industrial design
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.600]   Which you know, I think it's probably likely. I mean all I can do is offer, um, you know some inform speculation
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.640]   Well, it's a fair it's a fair prediction because apple has pretty clearly been on the two-year tick-tock
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.520]   update cycle for iphones minor upgrade which we just had which was the for us
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.120]   Major upgrade which was the four and presumably would be the five
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.760]   Yeah, yeah, I think I like the idea of the stretch screen
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.960]   So it'll have a four inch screen, but it won't be as wide as some of the android devices. It'll be longer
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.080]   Um, and uh, I think that makes a lot of sense because the the width it maintains that that same
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.720]   Easy to grip width and it goes in a pocket and it's not like a huge half tablet
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.240]   Right, um, and I can see them. Um, they're gonna need to make it bigger
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.800]   They're gonna have to have a bit of bigger battery for the lte radio because that thing's such a power hungry
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.280]   And also for the bigger screen. So I think they're gonna have to make it larger
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:04.920]   Um to accommodate those components, but um, I imagine it's still gonna be pretty, uh, you know still pretty sleek and smooth
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:10.040]   Uh some of the new android like the you know, the um, the uh, the samsung, um, the new samsung nexus
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.280]   Is really you know, it's quite that's quite a big device
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.840]   But still thin and it still fits nicely and you hand it into your pocket. I think it's gonna look, you know somewhat
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.080]   Uh like that
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.360]   And then will they keep I guess they will the four or form factor is like the less expensive
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.120]   Uh like as they did with a 3gs when the four came out
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.960]   I was oh yeah, they'll definitely keep it like the 50 dollar iPhone
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.920]   Right. Yeah. That's a pretty nice phone for 50
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.360]   You know
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.680]   It's hard to think of this as like oh, that's the old one
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.080]   And I think the the iPhone 4 is really beautiful. I mean it's gorgeous
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.440]   And uh, I just dropped mine on the concrete again for the tenth time and um, it's impractical
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.920]   Well, no, no, it's great. There's not a scratch on it. I don't have a scratch on it. There's no
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.280]   Well, I don't know why that is it's made out of glass. You just lucky
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.920]   Yeah, well, it's it's it stood up really well. It's stood up really really well
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:07.160]   Um, you are very lucky lander because I think that's not the normal normal experience
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.280]   I have to admit I've dropped mine. I dropped mine almost daily now. I don't know why but it
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.960]   Well, keep dropping it. It'll break recently what I waited for a mosquito
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.200]   I hate mosquitoes and I I waited for mosquito to land on my on my arm and then I hit him
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.720]   You know killed him and knocked the iphone out of my hand that I was holding into the gravel
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.960]   I thought for sure I'd lost it. Well, I've never broken mine except for drip drip dipping it in water
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.680]   But that was intentional. Uh, I've never broken the glass on mine
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.920]   So but my kids have broken the glass on theirs every single time I've had I've brought uh, and you know
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.920]   It's not too expensive to just get the glass replaced
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.760]   But I brought phones in to get the backhand front glass replaced at least half a dozen times
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.160]   But the iPhone 4 yeah
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:47.800]   But maybe that's because maybe that's teenagers my wife who is the most destructive person in the world probably a part of the kids
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.160]   Uh, she has an iphone phone. That's still kicking
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.440]   I mean, it's the only one that she hasn't destroyed. I got a stack of devices that she's killed. Maybe I'm not maybe I've been unlucky then
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.200]   Maybe that's maybe oh, maybe I don't see I think that the only design thing
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.880]   I don't like about the iphone 4 is that it really is a very slippery phone
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:09.960]   There's nothing that will cause it to grip on any surface so over the between the iphone 4 and the 4s
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.680]   I've actually broken the black the the the back glass
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.000]   Uh at least twice and so that's why later on I decided at minimum
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.160]   I usually put like a strip of gaffers tip on the back
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.680]   Just so that if I put it like on the sofa arm or put it on someplace
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.720]   It's not going to simply start sliding off millimeter by millimeter
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.280]   I have this new case on it that I really really like
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.880]   Shroom sleep cuz just has rubberized backing on right so you put it on the table
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.120]   It stays on the table. It is a shame to put a case on the beautiful iphone
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.520]   Leander, do you not use a case?
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.840]   Yeah, yeah, I've used the case. I can't only do you really stick gaffeta
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.160]   I can't believe it
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160]   I can't believe it
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   I understand this is a man wearing tactical pants ladies
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:52.920]   Chiefly I'll tell you I'll tell you exactly why because one of my default positions for having the phone is
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.080]   I'm on the sofa. I'm watching tv
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.920]   I've got the the I've got the iphone on the armrest of the of the sofa in case like someone texts me or say a kiss one
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.800]   Look something up and it's like unless you balance it exactly at the apex
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.560]   You don't move in the sofa. It's gonna start to slide at some point
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.240]   You'll like shift your weight and boom goes off the it goes off the armrest of the sofa
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.120]   And there's so many times when I'm trying to pick I'm trying to pull out of my
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.920]   Other other phones don't slide on my pocket as easily as this thing
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.760]   It's almost as if it's made out of teflon. It's like if there's any gap in my shirt pocket
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.680]   I'll bend over just a little bit too far and boom out it goes
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.480]   Rest if I put just a strip of gaffers tape on the back of it
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.080]   Or if I go to Home Depot spend eight cents for one of those carpet gripper things
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:42.120]   Is that the silliest thing you ever heard
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:47.240]   You lived on planet earth for how many decades and that's the silliest thing you've ever heard
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.120]   I don't like my iphone to be quite so snippy as super teeny
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.280]   Where's the gaffers tape? Where's the gaffers on the back on the side?
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.440]   Oh, it's I took it off because
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.200]   When I was this thing
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.080]   It's just like it's like one strip of like black tape
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:08.280]   Yeah, it also it also covers up the alpolo go so that if I'm ever invited to be like a guest star on a big bank theory
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.800]   They won't have to cover up the sticker
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.120]   So I'm just trying to grease the wheels for when the producer wants to ask me to be a cameo actor
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.920]   I'm a bang theory. I love this great on the big bang theory
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:22.760]   Why should be on the big bang you should be like a regular you should be like a the neighbor. Yeah, but they just walk over
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:28.520]   Is that we awesome? I would I would happily be like the dawn knots. Yeah. Yeah, that's your
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.160]   In
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:39.640]   So see I have a tether on my iphone, but that actually comes out very handy because you can't
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.120]   You could put your finger out of the toilet after
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.840]   So you do this and then when I walk around with an iphone like that or when I'm taking pictures
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.080]   I would you could do that just as easily with some gaffer tape
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.640]   Yeah, I know but I'm just saying I but but this is this is to your point of being a slipper
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.600]   You're absolutely right and so that's why when I take pictures
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.760]   I often will put this on because I know I'm gonna go
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.640]   Um, but that's probably you know me
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.960]   Whenever I have one of apple loners
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.160]   It's like and I had I feel like one of the things I really want to test out is like how well the camera works and man alive
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:18.040]   I'm never more paranoid by no a borrowed a borrowed device where I know that there's this thin
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.080]   Glass thing with like nothing to hold on to
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.840]   That's that's wrong. That's when we're traveling on vacation
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.080]   I'm really glad that I have a case like this because it gives you stuff to actually hold on
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.080]   And yet it's criminal to do anything to that beautiful design, but it just but it
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:39.880]   It's not you know, you know what I I still honestly think that one of the brilliant things about the iphone four and four is designed
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.480]   On top of just being a really beautiful object in and of itself. It's all flat planes and right angles
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.680]   So anybody who wants to design some sort of a case or some sort of amounting for it
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.640]   Doesn't have they can make a case that that fits it
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.520]   Perfectly so if you want to make a camera grip for it if you want to make a card grip for it
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.480]   You don't have to do this sort of like halfway gestures
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:06.040]   You can actually make it so that it looks like that this was just like the this is this
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.840]   This is just like the battery that you're sliding into this little holes
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   This uh, this
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.560]   Rewind playback. I'm sorry. I had three. I've had D boaters rest now
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.040]   It's really easy to make cases and frames for it that fit really really exactly
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.760]   And so if they come up with a new one that's sort of like curved and smiley face and slightly banana shaped
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.840]   As as always
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.080]   There's always those that first generation of cases and stuff that that are kind of fits it
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.720]   But not really because they didn't have the actual hardware to pull a mold up
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.400]   So what I want is a is a kit as a great case that that has something that some kind of protector for the front
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.800]   But also has a battery and a quarter 20 so that you can you can hook it to the tripod
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.080]   See that that's nobody's made that yet. I walked I went over to the mopey thing
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.560]   I love the mopey case, but just to add a 20 quarter 20 on that movie case and we're sick
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.640]   You know that actually they could and and and like a little lens mount on the now
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:03.320]   You're just crazy and and and two xr inputs. Well, that's a given. I mean come on that one
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   Jack don't forget the ethernet
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.840]   All right
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.880]   I said I was going to talk about two articles. I really love this week
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.920]   This is the other one from scott hanselman who uh, don't hold it against me works for microsoft
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.920]   But he's been thinking
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.960]   About icons that we use and this I just thought this was so great that don't make any sense for instance
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.600]   What is the save icon? It's a floppy disk?
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.160]   huh
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.920]   Radio buttons how when's the last time your car's radio had buttons
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.680]   huh
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:39.480]   Clipboards you see a lot actually I have one in my hands, but it's not that common bookmarks
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.280]   Do people even use books anymore?
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:49.720]   Address books calendars. This is that skeu morphic in a way. I love this one. What do they use for the icon for voicemail?
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.600]   They use those two it looks it's tape
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.960]   It's two reels with a tape between it
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:02.120]   Right. That was a long time ago. Does anybody does it does it my kid my 17-year-old
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   Who's never seen the tape recorder let alone an answering machine with tape in it
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.320]   Does he even understand what that is? But he knows what that icon means
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.480]   The manila folder all folders now
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.200]   Have vanilla folders, right?
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.000]   But really who uses that anymore?
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.800]   It was a little too far with that. I think people understand what a pen is
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.640]   They do and they and but the voicemail one and this one I agree with completely
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.760]   Telephone handset come on on the hand and I and not and not just for like young people
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   I was watching that really great
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:37.560]   Johnny Carson documentary last night
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:43.480]   And every time they're showing you like old video tape that doesn't really that won't upscale
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.040]   Well, they did they they get around it into hd
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.400]   They get around it by showing it like in like a tv set of the period
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:55.080]   And I grew up with like the 19 inch 13 inch color tv with two tuning knobs on it
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:00.360]   But I hadn't seen one in like 15 years. I'm like wow. What is that?
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.840]   And there's a second knob inside the first
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.280]   Remember that was for the tuning of the uhs
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.240]   You had a fine tune the uhs
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:17.000]   Magnifying glasses binoculars envelopes, but I think the part of it is the gears
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.720]   The part of the issue is is that the old analog devices make good icons
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.960]   Like these series the series icon is the same microphone Johnny Carson used
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.320]   It's an old ribbon mic that you know nobody uses these anymore
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.840]   But you know what it is right but how else how are you going to identify it?
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.680]   I mean the analog devices give us something that you can build a simplified icon around it makes sense
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.560]   My son thinks that's a time release capsule with a tuning fork around it
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.960]   That's the lonely filling up with bits
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.960]   Remember contact contact rather cold medicine. That's what it looks like
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.360]   uh a polaroid
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.920]   Sx 70 is the icon for instagram
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:01.000]   But but of course we know what it is right and there's those tv's that you talk about with rabbit ears
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.440]   They always when they have a tv icon, it's always got rabbit ears. I never had rabbit ears who has rabbit ears carbon copies
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.720]   It was like a microwave wouldn't it if you didn't have the rabbit ears on it. I think that's a
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.440]   It tells you what it is
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.160]   It's called device
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.840]   It's telling you it's telling you put something into the microwave
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   *Laughter*
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.360]   Step through the window. Anyway, thank you scott hansleman
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.920]   Hanselman.com for writing that uh
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:33.880]   I think it's a really great article just it's it we forget well, I still say dial the phone. I don't think anybody knows what that means
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.720]   Now when we when's the last time we had a phone with a dial on it
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.040]   I was talking to somebody who said that they they had one in a classroom and the kids will go up and they'll and they'll hit the button
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.560]   Like hit the button like it's not working. They don't think of turning it. I mean they don't even they don't even consider it
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.880]   They just like this isn't working. I can't
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:56.760]   Where do you the sandwich? There's no sand it. It's not made out of witches. Am I right?
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.560]   A spare headliner. Sorry
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.240]   What uh one more couple of things we mentioned drop box apps
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.400]   being uh blocked on the apple store that was apparently just a glitch
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.160]   uh
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.840]   People assumed it was because of in-app purchases with drop box once again drop box enabled apps are being approved by apple
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.600]   So that ain't true
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:23.080]   We last week we had darren ocata on and he talked about the fdr video which he shot with steve jobs
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.120]   Right
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:30.680]   Now a new video shows up the steve jobs lost ghost busters parody. We'll have to skip by the ad on bloomberg here
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.240]   And this will take a little while and I hate preroll ads
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.640]   And
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.080]   Especially for Goldman Sachs
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:43.080]   Do you hear we go new video released? This is an exclusive from bloomberg. So we probably can't even play this for you
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.800]   of steve jobs
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.840]   Ghost buster. This is for the dealer conference
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.200]   And they were wearing max on their backs
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.040]   When and then they would shoot the ibm pc
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.200]   Well an apple too actually is that an apple too or a mac?
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.840]   There's a mac on one of them and there's an apple to see in on the front. Yeah, one of them has a map
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.400]   Yeah, so that's how old this is look at that
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.320]   Who are you gonna call ghost busters? All right. That's a fun one
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:19.080]   Um, they make these videos all corporations make these videos for sales meetings and that was what that was ashton kutcher
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:27.720]   Yeah, no kidding god. We uh we talked about this on twit and I said he was sporting andi and akko style mutton shops
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.960]   Well, that case he's awesome. Yeah
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:39.160]   So he's but he looks pretty good from a distance in the steve job, but the problem is ashton kutcher's beard pattern is bizarre
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.800]   And does not in any way look like steve jobs. He looks he looks like ashton kutcher wearing all over that's what he looks like
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.680]   Um, they should use a phony beard for ashton to make it look more like steve. I think that is that beer's wrong
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.040]   Yeah, they're gonna have to fill that in. Yeah, I have to fill it in just a little here. We've
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.680]   Just you could just a little um
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.360]   spirit gum
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:06.040]   I'd love i'm not gonna make any fun of it because my my beard looks worse. That's why i say unfortunately i cannot ask siri
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.080]   What the best smartphone ever is anymore. They fixed that or did they let me try it
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.600]   What is the best smartphone ever
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:20.840]   The one you're holding yeah used to say the it used to say the
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.640]   Nokia lumiya 900
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.160]   I don't I never that's bizarre
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:32.440]   It's just a wolf-rained alpha. It's a wolf-rained from out from bug. It's not a bug. It's just that well
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520]   So Stalinist revisionism
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.320]   There was never was a martial force
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:49.400]   You are imagining see picture of Stalin. No one next to him. He never existed now continue on comrade continue to make zeal
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:55.000]   and you had this on the cult of meck lander alix he's writing says
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:03.640]   Apparently was niac really likes mark zuckerberg. He says he's an acute businessman with the ability to understand markets and what people want
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.720]   And he says actually that zuckerberg is a combination of was and jobs
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:17.240]   By which he means that was was the engineer and the scientist and jobs was the marketer
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.560]   And he says zuckerberg combines both those attributes. This is an interview in uh
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.440]   bloomberg business week
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:29.480]   Under the close direction of mark zuckerberg facebook recently acquired instagram blah blah blah blah
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:36.440]   So, um, yeah, I think was is right zuck seems to have both those skills sounds like was is going to be buying facebook stock
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.040]   Next Friday. Yeah, it's like no matter what the prices is gonna buy a bunch
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:45.240]   I think you know, I have I mean, I think you can afford it. Yeah. Well, I don't know
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.560]   You know, I think was did not make out as well as others from apples. Oh, but I think he's probably way that all right
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:56.520]   Very well said I think yeah, but he was very generous. He gave away a lot of his shares in the early days to people he felt
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.520]   Well being um, that's right. That's including Dan cocky. That's right. And he spent it on great things like music
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.960]   The us festival he spent much of his fortune on the us festival
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.160]   is
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:14.760]   Uh, he gave it was way in san o's a named was way because he gave a lot of money to set up the computer museum there
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.000]   Which is a great museum for kids and adults
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back our iOS and mac OS
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.640]   He's back our iOS

[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.720]   I want you to go to audible.com right now browse around see what book you might want. Andy. What are you listening to?
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.120]   I'm listening to the stand right now. What are you listening to right now?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.760]   I'm listening to a really cool business book
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:18.040]   Uh, it's more of a history book about the wall disney company during a really tumultuous and your period
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.680]   It's called by james b steward. It's called disney war
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:27.000]   and it's nonfiction. It's about a period in which uh michael icer took over the company and
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   Quickly made enemies including like his the right hand man
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.400]   He brought in jef rucassenberg who fought with him endlessly about the need to move from traditional animation to digital animation
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:43.880]   And during over the course of the story cats and berg splits off and start streamworks meanwhile the deal that disney have
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:49.720]   Picks are starts to go sour and picks are says you know what we're gonna just not renew this deal good luck with you with that
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:55.800]   Meanwhile the disney name executive roy disney who was uh role disney's nephew
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:00.760]   Is so fed up with icer that he quits the company and starts bad. I think i'm everywhere
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.960]   So using the disney name to say no, but michael's just a suit. He's an idiot
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.520]   He's a jerk. He doesn't know anything about the business
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:18.760]   So it really is just like a good 1980 style like night time drama where like William foresight is playing like the the patriarch of an oil family
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:26.600]   It's just nothing but drama and tension and just fighting fighting fighting green rich people who want wealth and power
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:30.440]   But don't want to give up either one of those things to get both of them. So what what's the name of it again?
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:35.240]   It's called disney war by james b steward. Wow, that sounds great
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.680]   Also good value on bridged at 25 hours and 47 minutes
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.600]   If you're if you're trying to stick it to the man for free title, this is a good mistake

[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.960]   I'm one of the things they're doing which I really like they yes, of course have lots of new books
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:59.160]   Uh, but they also are rerecording or recording in some cases for the first time classics like the end of the affair by graham green
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.760]   What a great book that is the unbearable lightness of being these are new
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.040]   audio additions
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.040]   Of classic books
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.120]   Um, so don't think audible is just the latest best sellers of course it is
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.560]   But it's very deep. There is a lot of stuff. Let me do a search
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.080]   Let's see if I do a search by title and I don't provide anything. I wonder if it'll give me
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.640]   Um, that'll that'll be everything right. I just curious how many books
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:31.960]   I think this is a fast way to count how many books. Oh, the other thing I love when I go to my audible account and I see oh
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.960]   You have two credits. Yay

[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.120]   audible stash
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.240]   64,682 according to that search
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:04.520]   That's only in english, but let's see if we have them in other languages too. Oh, yes. There's 5,000 non english titles as well
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.720]   audible.com

[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:23.400]   Should we search all categories? Let's say all program types then see how many we've got here
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.880]   106 144 that's the latest count
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.600]   audible.com slash Mac break. We thank them for their supportive
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.360]   Mac break weekly and now an iOS tip. Okay, so
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160]   As you may have guessed, I travel a lot
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.600]   Yes, you do. I have a problem. I have a problem. You got a problem. I have a problem that okay
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.360]   So a lot of times you know you go to a hotel room or you're now in your
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:55.240]   You go to a hotel room and you can hook your ethernet in and then you can share because they want to charge you 1495 for every device and which is
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.360]   Insane so what you do is you put your ethernet in of course and then you go into your network
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:05.640]   Or you go into your sharing preferences and then you say I want to share my ethernet connection
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.720]   via Wi-Fi and you create your own Wi-Fi network and then all your devices can actually use that Wi-Fi connection
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:16.360]   As an end for the hotel. There's just one device connected, right?
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.880]   We all know that one. Yes. The problem is is a lot of the hotels now only have Wi-Fi
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:27.400]   I know and if you're on a plane, it really only has Wi-Fi, you know, go go whatever
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:33.880]   So it turns out that if you connect via Wi-Fi and you go into your system preferences
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.280]   One of the options that's there that a lot of people I don't think a lot of people know about
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.800]   Is there is a bluetooth you can say I want to share via bluetooth pan
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.960]   Wait a minute. Let me let me let me just check that out. So system preferences
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:51.080]   System
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.640]   With a pan Alex. Yes, exactly. So you're in you're in um sharing sharing okay, okay
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:00.360]   And if you go in there and you look at your two sharing or no, no, no, no, no, no, there's the trick
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.520]   You turn them both on but see blue tooth sharing and then we go to internet sharing and you turn that on you want to say
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:13.400]   I want to say share my Wi-Fi via bluetooth leave that there. No, no show share your connection from not from pain
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.480]   Not from from Wi-Fi
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.280]   to bluetooth pan
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.960]   Now
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:24.760]   Wow any laptop or mobile device that is that is connected
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.400]   To your computer if you've set up bluetooth sharing
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.720]   If you if you connect those devices you can connect other laptops you can connect your ipad your iphone
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.680]   And you can share your Wi-Fi connection to those now. It's not super fast
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.600]   I don't know exactly how fast it is, but it doesn't really matter because most of these hotel rooms are horrible and
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.920]   At least you can get online. So we're you know and um, so this shares my Wi-Fi technically I think it's a federal offense to do it in the air
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:54.120]   Oh, yeah, you know, you know, I would of course never do it in the air that would I would never
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.640]   Although it's odd because they have Wi-Fi floating around
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:04.120]   Okay, so so anyway, um, but the uh, but you but the key is is that if you only have a Wi-Fi connection
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.800]   You can use that bluetooth and I have tested it and many work with an ipad with your ipad your iphone
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.720]   So if you have your Wi-Fi connection, you can use your you can use that bluetooth connection
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.600]   It takes a little bit of jiggering around to get it to link in you know, bluetooth is always kind of a weird connection
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.040]   Remember that that bluetooth connection isn't very far. So it's not like you can walk all over the place
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.920]   It's 30 feet or whatever, but you don't have to turn on bluetooth
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:30.440]   And then you go to internet sharing you start it and then you add bluetooth pan as a checkbox
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:37.240]   Yep, and then you can then you have to do a pair of the devices. It's magic. Anyway, it's very useful if you're traveling a lot like me cool
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.960]   Our lion or OS 10 tip from Andy Henaco
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:48.360]   This is actually a fix for a problem that a lot of people have I was certainly having a problem with uh mail on my mac
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.640]   Where I know there's you know, I use mail as my short term and long term memory
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.640]   It's sort of like a drop box for my brain
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.520]   Where I know that I was I was talking about this project someone two weeks ago
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.920]   I'll just do a keyword search. I'll pull up that email and remind myself about the stuff for some reason
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.520]   It it just it would just not find stuff that I knew for a fact was in there
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.680]   Uh, so if that happens to you you're probably going to need to rebuild your mailboxes
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.360]   And there are two different ways to do that
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.960]   One of them is to simply click on the mailbox and go to uh file
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.000]   The file menu at the very end there's rebuild mailbox as we'll reconstruct the mailbox from scratch
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.160]   That is not the nuclear option. However, uh, if that doesn't work
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.760]   That doesn't allow you to search for if define emails, you know that are actually there
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.440]   You'll have to go into your your user library hold on the option key
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.120]   in the finder
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.560]   Uh, uh, switch over to uh, switch over to the go menu
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.720]   That's that'll reveal the library directory if you're in uh, you're in line
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.840]   Then just navigate to the folder for mail and then inside there you'll find a
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:53.720]   File called envelope index. So that's where the index the the the search index for all of your mail is
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.040]   so all you have to do then is
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.400]   Quit mail
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.480]   Take this envelope index file move it out of the mail uh folder
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.480]   Don't delete it because you know as you might want it
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.720]   You might if things go wrong you might want to need it back later on
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:11.800]   But just take it out of that folder put onto the desktop then when you relaunch mail you'll get a very very very scary dialogue box
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.200]   Hi, welcome to mail. We're gonna have to re-import all of your mail
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.400]   But then we'll be ready to go you want to see some features with new mail while you're doing it
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.520]   No, it just that's fine
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.840]   Just click on okay after about after grinds away at all your messages for five or ten minutes
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:29.400]   It will totally rebuild your indexes and that should bring back uh search capability to all of your mail box
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.640]   If that fails there's some command line stuff you can do
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.520]   But chances are one of these two different things will work and solve my problems and suddenly I had my memory back
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.720]   Yay
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:40.040]   Very handy. Thank you handy Andy
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.720]   Okay, now for our picks of the week. We'll start with liana kani the cult of mac.com
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.360]   Okay, all right, so um
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.040]   It's the uh logitech ultra thin keyboard uh for the ipad
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.160]   And uh, it's a case
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.200]   That's also a keyboard. Oh my god. What do I go? Hold on
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:04.040]   Go go. Hey go the other way go towards your head
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.840]   Move toward yeah, there you go. Yeah
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.360]   Okay, here we go. So this actually it's stuck in there now. It's got a magnet. It's got a magnet which is nice. Yeah
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.680]   Yeah, and it's uh, you haven't featured this before have you not on mac break weekly
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.400]   We actually if you if you want to see sarah's review of it
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.560]   We did it on them before you buy this week our product review show and she loved it too
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:29.560]   I'm too thick to wait this out. Okay. I'm just gonna hold him for me. So how is it is a case?
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.240]   What it looks like is it you've got aluminum now on both sides of your uh
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.520]   Yes. Yeah, it's a big aluminum sandwich and um
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.880]   You know what? It works. Oh, hold up. I'll hold it up here
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.680]   And then and then people can see it because I have a camera that's really kind of aimed at it
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.560]   I don't have an ipad for it though. You got it. Yeah
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.800]   And do you have give me your ipad? Alex and i'll show you this kind of neat because as you say it goes
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:00.680]   You've got a slot here that is uh, basically like a stand but it's magnetized. So it uses it uses the um
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.800]   The magnets in the so you can actually that's kind of nice. So it makes it very sturdy feeling
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.200]   Right. Yeah, it's a really good stand
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:12.840]   And it's a really good keyboard and it's nearly not quite but nearly big enough
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:18.040]   Well, it can only be as wide as the ipad, right? You can't make it any bigger than the ipad
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.960]   This is that because of the big problem. Yeah, you know that with all the cases all the ipad cases
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.320]   And this one actually is is most of them are
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.480]   Oh, I some of them are the same width as the ipad not the same
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.200]   Length as the ipad. So this is one of the bigger ones
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:38.360]   Right because it's actually as wide as the ipad is is as long but it's a it's a nice combination of of case
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.800]   and
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.800]   Keyboard
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.160]   The other problem i have with it is is the silvery coating, you know, it's not
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.520]   It's it's um, it's already got a couple scratches on it
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:54.280]   And it's not quite as sort of scratch proof as I would like. Yeah, but it's it's nice aesthetically. It's it's uh
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.200]   I will protect the cut you know the top of it. It's a hard case
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.000]   It gives you access still to all of the ports and the and the buttons and everything
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.320]   Yeah, and it's using the magnet to hold it on. So it's like the smart cover
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.800]   Is it smart in the sense that yeah, it turns it on and off turns it on and off. Oh, that's cool
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.880]   Yeah, yeah, so it's good and the battery's the license is pretty good and
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.520]   It takes a bit of getting used to it like i'm trying to get my workflow to the ipad
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:26.120]   Um, so you and everybody else right so we don't have to carry a laptop anymore. Yeah, right. Definitely. Yeah
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.080]   I'm gonna go away this summer. So I really want to leave the laptop at home
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:35.400]   Unfortunately, it says on amazon usually ships within one to three months. I think you probably want to go to the logitech to get this
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.880]   It's it's a hundred bucks
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.880]   Um, I hope logitech hasn't been stuck amazon does not
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:47.560]   Not sure if they've actually is it out yet? Oh, maybe it's not out. Ah
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.160]   We we are lucky we have early versions. It's in it's in amazon
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:59.720]   Yeah in one to three months. Oh, did I just order it one three months? It said prime. Yeah prime within one to three months
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.760]   It just says I ordered mine. Yeah, I only one for every one to three months
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:07.480]   Yeah, do you see look at this Alex actually bought at lander
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.040]   Mine mine even so badly like I need like I was like that is that is the solution
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.800]   Well, there are a lot of cases now and this is bluetooth mine says it's gonna show up on wednesday
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.160]   Oh, well, you maybe uh, oh because I have the for the ipad two
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.360]   Uh, no, it says ipad two and do ipad. It's the same
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.920]   Mm-hmm
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:29.320]   Mine says it's it's on prime. Have you got the wrong one did I get the wrong one? Yeah, you got the one that's a case
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.520]   You got the case you want the ultra thin keyboard
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:38.520]   You saw it before I did it undo undo. I undo. I do undo one clicks all the time
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.840]   Because I am very impulsive
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.080]   Good pick 99 bucks. I like it. Thank you lien. Oh, the new old same pick was it. Hey lio. Nope
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:51.160]   Okay, no, it's a good pick though. I like it in fact. I want to who who has claimed this because if not i'm taking it
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:55.720]   I like it. Can I keep it?
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.280]   What is this just take it and run?
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.520]   Well, I think since it was attached to my ipad I get to know
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:09.400]   It's hidden now in the evil chair your pick of the week mr. Alex lense. So I have two but one is one is cheap and one is expensive
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.280]   Of course. So, um, that's why we named a unit of price the Alex
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:18.760]   So the cheap one by the way, I just want to make sure that people know I mean you probably talked about it on on twig
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:25.240]   Um that you know, if you if you're not using google plus or whatever hangouts on air is really cool
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.000]   And it is available to everyone and the new google plus app for the iphone
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.200]   Spectacular is spectacular. It's better than the hand right app. Although they say they'll they'll have it
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:39.880]   And it finally adds hangouts. Although I have to do a hangouts on air on it. Um, you could do a hangout though
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.680]   You could do a hangout and it's not intuitive how you get to the hangouts
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.320]   So just keep pressing buttons. I can't figure it out for the last one. I'm gonna have to invite you so anyway, so the um
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.520]   Uh, the one I can start a hangout. I really can it's weird though. It's it's it's hard to get to there
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.040]   It's hard. It is an awesome app
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:58.360]   The thing I want to make sure people are clear when they look at hangouts on air is now almost everybody's been you know
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.760]   Has now has access to hangouts on air. Yeah hangouts on air allows you to stream
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:09.960]   A conversation or a video that's going into your hangouts on air for free to youtube right with an embedco
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.080]   YouTube live your youtube live. I just want to make sure you're clear of that
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.560]   I mean I want to make sure that didn't pass anybody over. I'm always kind of surprised to make sure that you can now stream
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.920]   We live have youtube live now. You basically all of youtube live inside via a hangouts on air
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.760]   and uh
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.040]   And it's just a button in the hangouts
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.720]   And if you want to do a round table or whatever and it it'll connect your you know
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.680]   So you can be sitting on g plus and it'll post your screen. It's a pretty crazy feature
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:40.120]   I suppose that you could use hangouts on air without having anybody in the hangout just you right?
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.800]   Yep, just don't invite anybody and then you could just it would look a little odd in in youtube because it would be this big window with a bunch
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.400]   With one little window at the bottom, right? Yeah, you could do that and um and you'd be streaming to youtube. Is that one else?
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:56.840]   For free so um, so just thought I'd let you know. I mean just in case it passed people by they didn't see the news
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:59.080]   It's pretty pretty awesome. We do a lot of hangouts
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.160]   So um, I still can't figure out how to do it
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.160]   There is a way because there's a way to do
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.640]   I went I went through it and there is a way to do it
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.440]   But it's just not obvious but the new iPhone google plus f does let you do a hangout from google plus not on air
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.440]   I don't know if it's on air or not. It doesn't say out on air
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:19.000]   So but now my second one is a little more expensive. How much is that? This is $2,700. It's two and a half three and a half Alex's
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.560]   So so we do um, we talked about this a little bit from a video perspective at nab
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.840]   But um, so we record we do a lot of screen captures hours and hours and hours of screen captures
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:35.400]   And um, you can use camtasia. You can use screen flow. Those are all great. The problem is is you don't get broadcast quality
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.520]   um
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.120]   Screen captures, you know that are at full resolution at full frame rate
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:46.920]   That really integrate with something that you can actually send to somebody and if you're that kind of person looking for that kind of power
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.240]   Um, it's not what this was designed for but it's how we use it 90 of the time
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.080]   Which is the sound devices picks 240 and what it has is a little has um
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.680]   HDMI in and out and a keyboard of all things. Um, no, you can't type essays on it
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:06.680]   I wish you could it also has uh SDI which is you know the high performance hd sdi in and out
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.560]   Um, and of course you can put real mics into it as well
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.000]   Uh, it's this slot. I forgot to bring it with me. This slot is for an ssd drive that you can just slide in now
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.720]   The cool thing is if you take a connex cable
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.400]   Um, the connex is a little mini display port to hdmi cable
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.440]   You can plug it into your thunderbolt or or mini display port that has audio and plug it into the side of this
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:31.080]   Into the side of this and this has one feature that a lot of these devices don't have which is it can see
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.800]   60p or 30p coming out of your computer most need to be 2997 or 5994
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.240]   So you don't need a scan converter. You can simply plug one little cable into the sky
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:44.520]   And then what you can do is um, you start doing whatever you want and you just hit record and you record it
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.600]   And then you hit stop and you're done
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.120]   And uh, and if you're if you're someone who wants to get that full motion
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.120]   If you're doing training that requires video that has other things that you're doing playback
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.720]   Those things don't play back. Well when you're trying to capture the screen at the same time
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:01.640]   um, and so uh, and otherwise you're looking at scan converters
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.000]   You're looking at all kinds of other things and and for those of you who need this
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.280]   I thought I would share it with you
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.480]   We have so many like almost every person that sees us with one of these in in my little industry
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:17.880]   Um buys one like they're just like oh, I need that's what I needed a long time ago. So, um, so I thought I'd share it with everybody
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.000]   It's better than the atmos or uh, doesn't that's the most more expensive?
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.320]   Um, but it is this is a I mean
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.800]   It is such a workhorse and it has a compact flash on the top as well that you can use
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.680]   Uh as I said the ssd is awesome. Um, and
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.960]   We I mean I use it every day for that for this type of work and um, I don't know what I'd do without it
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.840]   We just have to remember that Alex got into this business for one reason and one reason only so he could buy the toys
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.960]   Have a lot of toys. So you understand. I mean nothing wrong with that. That's why I got into the business
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:51.320]   I like toys. So anyway, that is one of my favorite toys. It's from sound devices sound devices
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:58.360]   Um, they pretty much are the standard for it's twenty seven hundred dollars for those of you who are wondering. Um, wondering uh, it is uh, um,
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:03.880]   They are the standard in the field recording industry. So if you're recording audio in the field for
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.560]   Um, movies and so on and so forth and this is their first this was one of their first ones
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.440]   They now have one that's only HDMI, which is a little less expensive. It's like 1700 or 2000
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:17.880]   And then they have one that's coming out that's going to be a rack mountable version of that and um
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:24.840]   Anyway, so uh, it doesn't handle the full data from red somewhat virgial on the and the um, but it will uh, take
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.400]   Obviously the hdsdi out of the red if you want to record that as well. So
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.400]   So it's um
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.320]   And Alex is 700 not 800 dollars. I just want to make sure that no one's there's not
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.960]   I'm the Alex was the price of photoshopped
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.760]   I always said that the software should cost the price of photoshop should be the maximum. That's what it's all talking about
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.960]   That's where it came from. So many
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.520]   Some of the three phones now
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:50.920]   And Alex is, you know, not even in my Wikipedia, but the Alex is it's not it. Somebody took it out
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:54.680]   It took it out of my Wikipedia. Whoever it is screw you. No, it's
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.240]   Someone to someone with your legacies
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.080]   Someone went through my with your children
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.720]   They like took a whole bunch of stuff out and I was like really and I and I can't put it back in because my Wikipedia page
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:09.720]   I was like it was so it was so much my Wikipedia. I think was so much fun before and now it's really if you go to sound devices.com
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:14.040]   You can read that more and the one you're recommending is the pics 240 the 240 the 260 is what we're going to buy like
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.840]   10 of as soon as they come out that was a widescreen. What is that?
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:18.840]   Well, it's a that's a rack mountable version of it
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:26.200]   And it you can put two ssd drives behind the screen and have e-sata on the back and have a 32 channels of independently delayed
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:32.520]   How much would you pay? I think it's like oh don't even if you have to ask you can't I'm gonna say it's like four grand or something like that
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:35.240]   Andy and not co your pick of the week my friend
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:41.800]   Well, I'm very proud to say that I think it's been a long long time since I've recommended something that was even one Alex
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.640]   Yes
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.800]   And so this today's the big day
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:49.800]   This is I'm finally getting around to reviewing the Panasonic x1
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.360]   micro four-third camera
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.040]   Panas it was released like late last year Panasonic like sent me one
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.680]   Early but had to send it back in a lot of two weeks
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.960]   And I don't think I hadn't I didn't think I had enough time to really like rock and roll with it and really figure it out
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.960]   I've had this one for now about a month a little bit more than that
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:13.960]   And really fell in love with it. I really think that this is the sweet spot for these compact system cameras
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:20.280]   Interchangeable lenses, right? Exactly. There's a whole bunch of different companies have now gotten that game of having
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.440]   These cameras where it tries to be a hybrid between a pocket camera
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:29.320]   That's nice and small in compact and an SLR where you have a library of interchangeable lenses
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:36.280]   And also a nice large image sensors. You're getting much better image quality than you would on a conventional pocket camera
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:42.280]   And one of the hottest cameras right now happens to be the Sony and a x7 and the Sony and x5
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.680]   Which are very good cameras
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.200]   They have an even bigger image sensor than this not much bigger but bigger enough that it gives it the the Sony cameras
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:52.280]   Much better low light performance and
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.160]   wider dynamic range and and so translates to better pictures in some instances
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:00.440]   But I really think that this one really hits the sweet spot
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.240]   Because it is it does cost and Alex
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:08.120]   So this with the standard kit zoom lens will cost a little bit under 700 bucks
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.120]   If you just buying the body only if you already have these micro four third
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.120]   Third lenses, it's about 549 if you buy the really cool
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:21.320]   Motorized super compact zoom lens. It's closer to 900 bucks
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:26.840]   So it's much more compact not only that but it really is built like a traditional camera
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:31.160]   Which is something that I think is important when you go to that that Sony camera
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.880]   They don't have these mechanical buttons on the back
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.080]   Everything's done on the Sony via touch screen
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:43.560]   So you can't do something as simple as uh take one of these buttons program like your your favorite feature into it for me
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.560]   I really need to have flash compensation program into a button because that their time's going
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:51.080]   I want a little bit of fill-in flash the camera can't figure it out quite right
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.920]   So I'll basically put a tap a button adjusted and then take another shot
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.840]   On the Sony well on this one
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.760]   I just all of it is hit this button because I've set it up that way and I get that feature immediately
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:06.360]   On the Sony it had to start drilling into menus to get that and oftentimes by the time you're drilling into menus
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.600]   The shot is completely gone
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:11.240]   Not only that but it is based on micro four words
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:17.560]   Which is the dominant dominant the library of these compact lenses
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:24.040]   As on the Sony side you have to buy one of the four or five sony lenses that are available
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.600]   Uh, if you go micro four thirds, there's a huge library of lenses. Uh, just a couple weeks
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:35.160]   So I acquired this really cool fish eye lens that takes immensely satisfying super wide angle shots. Cool
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:40.280]   Yeah, I mean and also a panasonic also makes this they've had this for a couple of years now
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:48.280]   This really wonderful, uh, f 1.7 20 millimeter lens that just has such wonderful color and contrast that
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.320]   Really, I have I have the zoom lens for it
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:55.720]   But I almost ever take this lens off of it because it just makes such wonderful pictures also smaller
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:59.160]   It's pancake lens. It's also it's also smaller right there the problem of the sony lens
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.360]   The sony one is that they make the body tiny tiny tiny and slim
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.280]   Every lens port is the size of a soup can so you still can
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:11.960]   This this I can easily put into a jack pocket or I can put it into like my little like travel bag
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.880]   With the sony you really are stuck carrying it around your neck like mr
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:22.120]   T uh or carrying a camera back for it and also they've done simple things like you know on this on this on this one
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:30.200]   Standard flash hot shoe so you can use any standard flash or wireless flash rig that you want with sony for some reason
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.960]   There's a flat there's a flash shoe, but they've decided to go for their own special design. That's not compatible with anything else
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:42.440]   So anyway, I just I it's all about the sweet spot. You will find cameras that might take better pictures under many conditions
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.240]   Uh, again, the sony costs 1500 bucks and for that money it should take better pictures than this
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.200]   But if you're looking for something that is small enough
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:56.840]   Really want to not only travel with it as I do but also gee I know i'm gonna have two hours of free time in the city after my meeting
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:00.280]   I think i'll take my camera make take maybe spend a couple hours taking some pictures
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.400]   I don't want to take my SLR with me. This really is the perfect thing
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:07.880]   The review of it is going to be up on the sun timeside this week and it did it did
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.240]   the hit that coveted distinction of saying
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.760]   Yeah, I got to send this back to panasonic at the end of this week, but yeah, I did not
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.360]   All yeah, no, I actually bought one for myself. Oh, okay
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:24.280]   It's it's it's it's good enough that for the past year and a half two years i've been sort of
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:31.560]   Not necessarily explicitly budgeting for it but knowing that my my nicon big SLR is going to be a little bit longer than two
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:35.320]   That I should probably think about buying the decent thousand or the decent 100 when it comes out
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.560]   Now i'm not saying that i'm not gonna buy i'm never gonna buy another SLR
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:44.120]   But this one covers so many of what I so much of what I really need a good camera for that
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:47.480]   I'm at least gonna put it off until the next generation of SLR comes out
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:54.360]   Actually trade rack if uh supposed that these new mirror lists of micro four thirds and other mirror lists formats would replace SLRs
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:01.160]   The SLRs he really thinks that the quality is kind of I think they're really gonna put the hurt on the affordable SLR market there
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.320]   A Canon and an icon both make a whole bunch of really good cameras across less than a thousand bucks
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:10.120]   But they are as big as an SLR right and so for the same amount of money you get image quality
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.160]   That's just about as good. I don't think that's gonna go away because there's still going to be people who are
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.840]   When you get above the enthusiast market even the the serious enthusiast market
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.000]   There are gonna be lots of people who are gonna need no
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.480]   I need I need a big beefy friend that I can actually get a good get get my hands around really really easily
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:33.240]   I really do need that big full-frame sensor. I don't want to have proprietary lenses or proprietary flash unit
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.280]   So but yeah, it really is gonna put the hurt on any SLR the cost between $100 and a thousand
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:47.720]   Andy took a bunch of pictures with this camera when he was in uh Dublin and they're on his flicker uh site and he eyes his uh handle on flicker
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.160]   One one last thing though is that I forgot to mention it
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.440]   I really I really want to single it out one of the nicest thing is about this
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.520]   This isn't unique to this model, but it has a really good intelligent auto mode
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.640]   And the way they've chosen to implement it is really really nice
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:07.000]   Normally I keep this camera in like some form of program mode so I can choose the ISO
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.880]   I can choose exposure compensation, but I often get myself into trouble because I've sort of out thought the camera
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:19.160]   This has a single button up here for it's called intelligent auto when I when I tap it
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:23.160]   It's marked in blue. Oh, it's focus is a focus is nice when screwed up
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:23.960]   But
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:29.800]   Is that you see the blue glow? That's that that's a button that immediately says override all of my settings
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.080]   Make every single decision for me that you can
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.960]   Including what scene mode you want to use
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:41.800]   Uh, I was testing out the other day. Uh, this is a there's a steampunk festival in wolltham over the weekend
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:49.240]   Uh, and so that's what that picture came from uh, and I was again trying to put photos of a waterfall. I saw these people coming
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:54.360]   I had forgotten what I had set this camera at but assuming I simply tap that one button
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   Immediately went into make all the decisions for me. So not only did it choose the right exposure settings, but I also figure out
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.120]   Oh, I see human faces here
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:08.600]   So I'm going to definitely lock the photo lock the focus just on these human faces and not be distracted by any of the details and the costumes
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:11.240]   Does it think the accounts are humans by the way
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.360]   It should
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.680]   You prick them they bleed
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:18.680]   Gowser people too
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.840]   We joke, but that is actually funny. I do enjoy it when I take pictures of like sometimes a dog's face
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.920]   It will say okay. I see eyes. I see something that I can nose
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:33.480]   I'm gonna decide that's gonna be the focus point doesn't always work, but it's often interesting
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:36.440]   Uh, I'm gonna have to take a look at this gx one
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.320]   I've seen a few of them in the field and people seem to really like them now
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.000]   I'm interested microfiber
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.080]   Thirds is a standard too because you can use lenses from other people as well. Yeah
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:50.280]   Thank you, Andy. All right. My pick today is something we saw at NEB as well
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:53.000]   Yes, you did the piece with ktech
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:59.240]   They make the carbon fiber poles that are used by uh, everybody studios everywhere to hold the microphones
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:06.040]   But they also make a lightweight pole that you can use to put your iphone on it's awesome and shoot a video
[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:10.120]   Hello everybody. I'm here on my iphone recording a video now notice
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:15.320]   There's a couple of things i'm going to point out here first of all the microphone on the iphone is also distant
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.960]   So you and I have been trying to figure out a solution. This is something I've reviewed before the apogee
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:25.720]   Uh, mic which is the only to my knowledge digital mic that works with the iphone apogee also makes a mic interface
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:30.040]   Right so you can you can have any mice like a little box and then you can have any mic pop into it
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.960]   And then it would pop into the so they make a longer cord which I can't find if I had the longer cord
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:40.440]   What i'm thinking is i'll gaffer tape the mic to this ktech tadpole and then I just you can also use like a
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:45.800]   It's going a little too far, isn't it the scent hyzer to go really too far the scent hyzer
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:52.120]   Wireless mics have a eighth inch jack out. Yeah, which um you could just do the analogs a little conventional recording
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.360]   That's all but the the idea the tadpole is is very lightweight carbon fiber
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:02.120]   These are about 93 bucks for this length, which is a three segment length that they have shorter and longer
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.320]   And it is so solid so yeah, it's not and it's not too heavy. You don't mind holding it
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:13.640]   It's just like a monopod or you know the telescopes down to any length that you want to use now
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:17.640]   This a couple of a couple of feature items. Let me pull up the
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:23.320]   The website here so I can show you this it has a ball head which makes it very easy
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.960]   This isn't just for the iphone by the way
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:33.240]   It's for anything that has a you call it a one quarter twenty quarter twenty thread which is a standard tripod thread
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.240]   Um, so you could put a GoPro on it and I think a lot of people do
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:38.840]   um
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.160]   100 bucks now what I don't recommend is they also sell an aluminum
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:51.480]   Case a ktech case for the iphone that has threads on both axes for a standard
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:54.200]   tripod
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.760]   Unfortunately my experience with the case well first of all, you know apple doesn't sell slide on cases anymore
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.840]   For fear that the back will get scratched on the iphone for s
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:06.520]   Um, but also, um, it's I couldn't get it off
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.840]   Which is funny because my problem was it was so easy to come off
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.200]   I thought I was gonna fall off they fixed that obviously now it's really hard to get on
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.640]   I'll trade you because I want the one that won't come off you can have that all right
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:22.120]   But I have used something else instead which I actually prefer and this is um, I mentioned this I think before
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:28.920]   I certainly did a review on the giz was this is a rock for my phone case and I really like these cases
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.800]   They sent me one because they were gonna advertise and then I did a review of it
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:34.680]   And they thought we don't have to advertise Leo just talks about it. So
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:40.200]   What can I say but I actually really like it is uh, it's not the most, you know, it's a it's an okay case
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.400]   This is plastic. I do have to admit I like having this hand strip
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:46.520]   But what I really like about it is it has on this back this notched
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:49.080]   A hole which can be used for a variety of things
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.200]   I have a knob that's glued to my dashboard in the car when I get in the iphone goes right in the dashboard
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.480]   That's very nice. They also sell and these are all sold separately
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.240]   They also sell a tripod mount that just clicks on who's this a knob
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.880]   This is a company called rock form rok
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:10.200]   F ORM and so I don't have to carry around a case that has tripod mounts on the edges all the time
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.680]   This is a normal iphone case, but then I can click in a tripod very easily
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:19.400]   Mount very easily. Um, and so that that's kind of handy. Whoops. I gotta tighten this down
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.360]   And uh, by the way, the other thing that's on this this is great
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:25.880]   It has a very strong rare earth magnet that goes right into this hole here
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.680]   So I can actually slap this on the metal and it it just stays which is
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:33.880]   Probably illegal certainly unhealthy
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:36.280]   That's very convenient
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:43.000]   So the rock form cases, uh, I don't you know, the price is very depending on which uh things you add on uh to it
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.680]   But I'm I'm gonna say uh, it's certainly cheaper than
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:54.920]   They do make a 39 dollars. Yeah, Amazon. They do make a luxury aluminum case, which I do not recommend at 300 at dollars
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.440]   Um, it looks like it's a gold case
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.160]   Don't get that one just get the cheesy plastic
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:04.280]   Case, uh, the rock bed
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:09.880]   Which is 39 dollars and then you will want to get the attachment because uh, you know
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:12.840]   You need to get the accessories they come in all different colors and everything
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.240]   The attachments are really what make it particularly useful. I love being able to put this on my dash
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.960]   So that's two two two tips really one is this tadpole 93 bucks
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:27.240]   You will need to modify your iphone or whatever you're going to use on the tadpole to make it work
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   Um, and in this case, I recommend the rock form case with the tripod
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:36.040]   Yeah, they have they have a they have a belt clip slash I have all of them
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.400]   Bob opener
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:40.360]   That's the party the party one. I have all of those nice
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:44.120]   So you can I don't clip my phone in my belt that seems silly, but you're right you can't open beer with it
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.240]   So you clip your phone in belt because the magnet all of these attachments
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:49.240]   This is actually kind of a clever idea
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.440]   Because I hate carrying those ugly cases with the tripod attachments on them
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.440]   So this is this is a better solution and you just carry this thing is uh
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:02.200]   It also rotates so you can have that you have it in any uh aspect that you want
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.440]   uh, the rock form will mount it in either this way or
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:12.760]   Uh, you know this way and it won't have it on the side like that, which is obviously what you want to do for standard
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:15.880]   For you know, 69 shooting. Yes
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:21.000]   Don't shoot the stuff. Don't shoot it. Don't shoot it. Don't shoot portrait. That's crazy talk. Well, I
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.080]   It's shot this great video with it. I wasn't really thinking, you know, you're just kind of holding my phone in suddenly. I was like, oh, uh
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:30.760]   It's portrait. I screwed the whole thing out portrait and just to reiterate
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.640]   I think I picked this before but this is a great mic the apogee mic
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.680]   It's uh digital all digital which means it plugs into the 30 pin port on the iphone 4
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:44.840]   Which requires a digital input and gives you surprisingly good audio. Yeah, it's one of the best mics out there for that
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:53.320]   Finito we're done. Uh, thank you Andy and echo for joining us from the celestial waste of bandwidth in the chicago sun times
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.400]   You are my own personal hero mr mutton chop
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.080]   Uh, that's not my christian name, but okay
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:08.280]   He's you know made out to the right the last guy still wearing mutton chops except for ashton kutcher
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.600]   Ah
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:15.560]   That's kind of he makes you want to change doesn't it just buddy would actually cut your the same sentence twice the same show
