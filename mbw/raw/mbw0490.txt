[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We're going to talk about the latest Apple news, including the sad case of a widow who
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   wants to unlock her iPad.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Apple says you'll need a court order for that.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   No, no, no, it's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   With a little bit about handbags.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte joining us right now from the Chicago Sun Times and the In Not Co.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Good to see you once again.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It could be said that we are your leather boys.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So to speak.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I should put that through Urban Dictionary to find that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I think you might know.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You might not want to say that again.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Also joining us from parts unknown.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Have you joined the Witness Protection Program?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Where are you Renee?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   No, I'm in Mobile Nations Canada Headquarters, aka Winnipeg, aka the frozen wasteland.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Oh my God.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Who would ask you to go to Winnipeg in January?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Kevin Mitchell, my glorious boss lives here and so he's decided to build out everything here.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And so I am now, I went out of the ice cube trade into the freezer.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And the mystery of tourism is probably not approving this for the brochure visit.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   scenic Winnipeg.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It looks like a sensory deprivation tank with a little plan.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Wait a minute, the plant's gone.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Who saw your plan?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I meant it was really weird because there's a Fortnite display in front of me.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Two apple monitors on either side of an Australian.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's all.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And it's just very often.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's all it matters.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Give my regards to the ice road truckers.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's all.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I will.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Also in studio here in the studio with us.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's Alex Lindsay of the Pixel Corp back from a pretty prestigious assignment, but I don't
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   know if I can talk about it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I can say I can talk about it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I just couldn't talk about it before.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   What were you doing?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So we managed the live stream from the White House last week.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   After the State of the Union.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It was on Friday with the YouTubers.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   YouTubers.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You know the YouTubers.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Neat.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You're going to be able to talk about it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm going to talk about it.

[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.720]   The issue is that the issue is that the talk that he should be having is, you're the reasons
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.360]   why you can't manufacture an iPhone or a computer in the United States of America.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.520]   Part of it is because we don't have the manufacturing capability to do that.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.760]   His answer has to be, here is how we're going to bring more jobs from overseas back to America
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.240]   by making it easier to make that capability happen in the United States.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   Then it has to be, well, if we give industries tax breaks and credits for building factories
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.880]   in the United States, what is going to stop them from using the money that they might be
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:12.960]   generating from this to try to maximize overseas production even more?
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.800]   It's a vicious cycle where, I'm sorry, it's a vicious election cycle where you say that
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.920]   we're going to try to make more jobs in America.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.200]   The way to do that is by giving tax breaks to big corporations, but now you're accused
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.080]   of taking part in corporate welfare.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.680]   I don't think that Trump is thinking on that level.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.120]   I really do think that he, again, he knows he's got the monkey control push buttons in
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   front of him.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.200]   One of them is labeled Muslims, not one is labeled immigration.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.440]   One of them is labeled jobs, taxes, and he just pushes them to get the effect that he wants.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.600]   Of course, remember, even if he did tell that long story about all the things that need
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.640]   to be done, the news media wouldn't carry it because it's not a sound bite.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   That was a great sound.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   That's a sound bite.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   That's a great sound bite.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.600]   Well, they'd carry it.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.680]   There's journalism being done on all levels everywhere.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.160]   The problem is that there's the exact same problem as with these campaign sound bites.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   The ones that really resonate are the ones that can be summarized into, again, as you
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.560]   say, a little sound bite.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.320]   That doesn't say, that doesn't mean that the actual journalism isn't out there and isn't
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.440]   being effective.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.320]   It just means that the ones that you notice are the ones that have those buzzfeedings
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   sort of headlines.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.120]   All right, well, let's talk about Jeb Bush then.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   I love this video.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.960]   Jeb Bush is, of course, the Des Moines caucus is the Iowa caucus coming up in the two weeks.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.320]   He's talking to the Des Moines Register and he is, well, he hears a voice.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.400]   Jesus, is that you?
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   It's your voice.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   My watch can't be talking.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.640]   Oh, yes, it can, Jeb.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   Is it my watch?
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.040]   Yeah, it sounds like it.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.960]   I'll call you back.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.680]   I've never had my bad phone be turned on.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.280]   That's the coolest thing in the world.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.400]   I know when it's ringing, but I've never actually used it.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.960]   Underutilized eye watch.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   Where were we?
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.320]   I think that's a great moment.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.920]   In fact, it makes me like him a little.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   I feel like the same way, but I'm a grandpa too.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   Hello?
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   What?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   Hello.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.280]   Remember when his dad was at a supermarket who saw barcode scanner for the first time?
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   Wow.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.600]   It's not that you can understand how a president might not be aware of what it's like in a
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.680]   supermarket over the past three or four years.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.560]   You'd like him to be able to not be quite so forest gump-ish at his astonishment of this
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   magical spirit box.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   I have.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.120]   We call him an eye watch because I think 70% of us are still calling it an eye watch.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.560]   I have to admit that I have accidentally entered on my phone and then...
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.680]   There's a lot of personal weird ways of curse after that because I don't like that.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.040]   That's the one one of the things what I really want to be able to do is hit it and then have
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.920]   it answer on my regular phone because it's this part.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.240]   I'm not really there's a lot of things I love about my iPhone and doing this is not
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   really one of them.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.320]   I think I'm in the future every time it happens.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.400]   The other day I was just testing battery life on the six plus and it lasted two days but
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.880]   by the morning it was just dead so I had to plug it in and the plug was in another room
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.760]   and I was busy cooking and my phone rang several times for family members and I was
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   just answering it while I was cooking setting time and it really felt like I was in the
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   future.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.040]   I just loved the ability to do it.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.400]   I probably shouldn't bring you all down talking about seven-year-olds working in lithium-ion
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.960]   battery mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Yep.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.440]   We talked about it.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.040]   You have to decide whether you're going to engage and try to change it or you don't
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   know what you do.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   Try to starve it out.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   Actually, there is something happening with this.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.480]   It's harder with this but there is something that's happening with diamonds and I think
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.320]   we might have touched on it before which is using diamonds what they're starting to do
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.560]   for blood diamonds and so on and so forth is they are starting to identify the diamonds.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.920]   They actually put a little code on it as well as they, every diamond is an even after it's
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   cut is unique and figuring that out and then actually putting that into the blockchain.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   It's like a work for this problem because this is the problem.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.080]   Because what they're doing is cobalt which is eventually going to become part of a battery.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.360]   There's no way to really identify cobalt as it comes out of it.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.640]   You can't except for the fact that you can start building a chain of trusts across these
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.080]   things where they're going to go into packages that are sealed and there's a process to it.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   Those kind of chain of trusts.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.520]   Those kind of trade lithium ion batteries could happen.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.120]   I think people would buy them.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.080]   I buy fair trade coffee and it's more expensive whether it should be or not.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.800]   But I mean everything around us is largely made up of things that we don't want to know
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   how they got made.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.440]   Yeah, this was a report from Amnesty and of course they single out Apple, Samsung and
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.280]   Sony but the truth is is lithium ion batteries is there anything you have that's battery
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   powered?
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.160]   Well, we had that incident with shrimp over the holidays where they identify that a lot
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   of the shrimp was being done in the sense slave labor in Thailand.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520]   Right.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.880]   And all over the world people buy the shrimp that is made by slave labor and they do the
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.520]   same kind of investigation there.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.840]   And it all comes down to should the companies pull out an abandoned support there or should
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.920]   they stay engaged and try to force change in those areas.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.680]   And they seem to do it on a case by case basis.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.920]   And I think almost all these kind of companies including Apple are constantly researching
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.000]   this and putting pressure on people and so on and so forth.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.080]   There's a certain level of evolution that can happen at one time.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.080]   I think it's part of the problem.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.440]   It's really hard to because it really is one of those things that you walk away and
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.600]   then those people don't eat.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   So you have to figure out the, you know, you have to figure out that balance of constantly
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.080]   improving it which I do think that they have to do but I don't think pulling the plug
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.880]   is necessarily the right solution.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   All right.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.680]   Something more, Apple's going to kill my Tint's radio.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   That didn't go well.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   It was in the US.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.200]   They put it in Australia but it never really went anywhere.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.600]   So you never even saw it?
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.000]   No, most of the world never got it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.240]   As soon as the Beats acquisition was in the pipeline, they just, it looked like they just
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.520]   lost all interest in iTunes radio.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.360]   Did you know there is such a thing as iTunes radio anybody?
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   I've heard of it.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   I haven't actually heard it.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   I heard of it.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.080]   If you click the radio tab in iTunes, you'll see Beats 1.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.400]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.560]   It's the stuff below it featured stations, styles of stations and all of this.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   This is Pandora.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.280]   So those we have, those are pretty much international but there was a separate iTunes
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.840]   radio program that...
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   This is not it?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   Yeah, there was an, there were, you could, if you were an iTunes Max subscriber, you'd
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   get it without ads.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.600]   If you weren't, you would get it with ads and it was almost like a Pandora sort of a...
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.000]   That's not, so what I'm looking at right now, the Pure Pop, that's not it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.240]   Those are radio stations within iTunes but those are not iTunes radio.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.800]   Apple had a, again, before Apple bought Beats, they were going to try to compete by doing
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.520]   their own product which was iTunes radio and the idea was to roll it out internationally
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.920]   and it got as far, it launched in the US a long time later, it showed up in Australia
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.840]   and they just had a heck of a time rolling out.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.440]   So this is going to stay in iTunes and this is going to stay free.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.040]   What I'm looking at right now where it says Latin Pop, sports and news.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.520]   That's all, because these are real radio stations?
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.320]   No, these are, these are sort of...
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   Smart Playlists.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   I mean...
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   This is Pandora.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   Kind of.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   Sort of, but it's not the level.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   iTunes radio was a level sophistication of...
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.680]   Where would I find iTunes radio?
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.560]   On your iPhone, I think still in the music app but I don't have an American...
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.200]   Do you see why they got rid of it?
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.040]   Well, because A, it's really confusing to me but you know what I'm missing.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.440]   I didn't know if I wanted to do this story because I didn't even know what it was so
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   they didn't get rid of it.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.040]   They're just going to, you only get everybody in the North Coast Macadise users group is
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.200]   now looking for it on their iPhone.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.360]   You don't...
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   You don't...
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   What are they talking about?
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.280]   You won't get rid of it but you won't get it unless you pay for Apple Music.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   Right.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.400]   And that may be more because of deals with the record companies.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.080]   I don't know why they did it but...
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   What?
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.000]   The irony is it's not the radio button.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.120]   It sounds like it actually is connected to the end of Iads.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:08.640]   So the financial support for this was connected to Iads by end of lifing Iads.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   It...
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.800]   The end of life is the financial support for the free stations.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   I think I believe that those two are tied together.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   Tied together, yeah.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.240]   We were listening to Roger Whitaker from last week.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   Thanks a lot.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Likewise.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   Where would I find this out?
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   Well, you don't know.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Who knows?
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   I don't know.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.000]   I think I do think it's almost everything except for Beats 1.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.400]   I think it's like all the stuff you see there is all...
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.280]   I don't think you're going to get access to any of it unpaid except for Beats 1.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.760]   Star Wars soundtrack selections.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.160]   I see I have that in Canada and I don't have iTunes radio so that can't mean...
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   Okay.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160]   So you have that.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.760]   We really have to do some detective work to figure out what it is exactly.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.240]   It's super confusing at what time.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.120]   Yeah, you have the same exact same thing.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   And there's no iTunes radio in Canada.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.600]   So this is still available absent iTunes radio.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.800]   But it hasn't been turned off yet.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.080]   No, but he doesn't have it.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   He's never had it.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   Never had iTunes radio.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   Because he's in Canada.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.080]   Right.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   So that can't be it.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.880]   It's very confusing.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   But do you have Apple Music?
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   Yes.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   Okay.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.880]   So I'm confused.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.720]   And then there's what happened to streaming radio stations that disappeared with the last
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   major update.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   Right.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   And now if you want to...
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   Those did not, by the way, disappear.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.200]   They just got hidden.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.480]   Deeply under a menu.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.240]   You now have to go under a menu and you also have to now actually know the URL that you're
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   trying to stream.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.600]   Like, is the directory still there?
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.760]   Adult contemporary.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   There it is.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   New millennium sound.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]   ABC radio.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.040]   But I was told by somebody in the know, what is the term you're supposed to use?
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.320]   Somebody with knowledge of Apple's plans.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.880]   That this was going to disappear, but it's still here in my current iTunes.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.360]   But to get to it, you have to go to the dot dot dot menu where we live, where podcasts
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   live and then go down.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.680]   Well, it was here.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.560]   But I guess because I'm in it, it's not there anymore.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.840]   People familiar with the matter.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.000]   People familiar with the matter say go to the dot dot dot menu and then internet radio.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   But this is streaming radio.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.480]   This is not what they're talking about either, right?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   Right.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.680]   And I could be completely wrong, but I remember iTunes radio being more like Pandora where
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.520]   you had a better sophistication.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.640]   Like you could like an unlike songs and it had ads at an ad level and a free level and
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.920]   it was a productized thing.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   And this is just sort of like...
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.360]   Anybody in the North Coast Macintosh users group know?
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.840]   You find it.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.560]   You have it.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   It's buried in iTunes.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.200]   Where do we go and you're looking at your iPhone right now?
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   Walk me through it.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Do you have Apple Music?
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.400]   Do you have some of those photos right now?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   So are you subscribers on Apple Music?
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   No, no, no.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.200]   Well, they haven't killed it yet, maybe.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Right.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.920]   But you're only seeing it and you're seeing nothing, right?
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   You're just seeing Beats 1.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   I'm not the same thing that I'm getting it under radio but I'm getting it out of my...
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   This is really great.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   I see my...
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520]   Oh, Lord above.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   This is why would I?
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.200]   This is why would I?
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.120]   Go to it?
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.560]   Patrick, tell my hand.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   No, is that it?
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   You're using it.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.080]   But it hasn't been turned off yet so we wouldn't know.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.480]   I do believe it's everything but I think essentially everything that...
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   Yeah, that's...
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   That's not Beats 1.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   This is the same...
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.880]   No, that's what we've been saying is we don't think it's that because Renee's getting
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.120]   him to look at it.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.720]   And it doesn't have the only entertainment.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.280]   You're not on the desktop.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.520]   Damn your eyes, you're making me launch the iTunes app which is something I try not to
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   do.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:41.360]   Okay, so this is why, by the way, I avoided this story on Twitch.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.840]   I avoided this story on iOS today because I didn't understand it.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.360]   What are they killing?
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.120]   Apple has announced that the ad supported iTunes radio stations available in the US and
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.800]   Australia are going away January 29th.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.400]   Beats 1 will be the premier free broadcast going forward.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.600]   All other radio station features, i.e. the algorithmic stations like charting now or
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.880]   pop workout, will require an active Apple music subscription.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.560]   So I'm looking so...
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.200]   Still unclear by the way.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.680]   We'll find out January 29th.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.600]   And again, I think this has to do with the fact that it turned off the ads.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   Where are you playing that?
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   Is that Beats?
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   Is this me?
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Sorry, I somehow am making tracks.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.240]   He's knocking at my stream.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.160]   I'm so sorry.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.640]   There remains confusion on the subject.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:44.600]   We'll find out January 29th.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   It says radio.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   Yep.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.560]   But Renee's of the opinion that since he has it in Canada, it's not.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.920]   Yeah, but there was a distinct iTunes radio product that you could do stuff with.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.080]   We do know that the...
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   We know what iAd is.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   Kind of.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.800]   I didn't see that very often either, which is probably why they're shutting it down.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.160]   So this was a way to buy ads in apps, right?
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:12.280]   And an app developer would put an iAd in the app as a little banner at the bottom of the
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.080]   screen or maybe a bigger banner.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.720]   It would help get them attention on their own apps.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.040]   So mostly was it app developers buying iAds?
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.120]   There were different products.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.400]   There was one, the original iAd service that Steve Jobs announced where it was like a million
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.040]   dollars in a company could make these beautiful ads and those could be circulated.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   But there was also a program where developers could essentially buy iAds for their apps and
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.360]   then their apps would show up inside other apps and it was a way for people to get sort
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.520]   of some attention on them.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   Right.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.280]   Anyway, that is sort of going...
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   Here's a chat room.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:55.840]   Listen to Apple Music Radio.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.440]   If you have a subscription Apple Music, you got an unlimited skip.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.720]   Listen to on demand stations without ads and ad songs you like to your library.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   So I think Renee, whatever it is that you're getting, that's what we were...
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   This is it, right?
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   I think you had a more sophisticated version where we had all the people you had to skip
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   and to do a whole bunch of things.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.360]   No, you can't skip unless you have a...
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   I'm looking for a...
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   It says, okay, wait a minute.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.400]   You don't need an Apple Music Membership to listen to Apple Music Radio, but if you have
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.800]   an Apple Music Membership, you can listen to on demand music stations with no advertising
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.840]   on one device at a time.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.760]   To listen on your iPhone, open the music app.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.680]   No, what we were showing is apparently what they're killing.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.360]   I don't know what you have Renee.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.680]   What you have is a cheap imitation.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   Yes.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.120]   Very basic version.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.120]   There's a what?
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   There's a slider.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.120]   There's a slider.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   So, I changed music.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   I changed.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.600]   This is strange that we are so confused about this product, but this is...
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.160]   I don't know, it's Apple Music.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   So it's a music product by Apple.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   It's a service from Apple.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.840]   So that's pretty much par for the course.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.200]   I was talking to someone the other day.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.160]   He just says, "conversationally."
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.040]   I've got all my photos in the cloud, I think.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.680]   And I said, "Oh, so you're an iPhone user."
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.080]   Okay, now that one works.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.200]   I'm on the ice planet Hoth.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.760]   And you're saying there's a slider here somewhere?
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.640]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.000]   It's very soothing.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I don't know.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.240]   All right.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.560]   I don't know.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.720]   See, then there's a radio station there too.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.040]   I don't know what this is.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   All right.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.520]   It can be 2007 again.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.600]   Remember, we're still on the big hive from the iPhone and Apple's doing everything just
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.000]   right and we had faith that if we didn't understand something, it made sense.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   We just got it wrong.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.480]   You know, they could have...
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.120]   Really, now I'm convinced not announce this.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   Yes.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.080]   And no one would have...
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.720]   There would have been January 29th to come and go without a word.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.360]   It would be an interesting test.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   So I...
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   And I think you're right.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.680]   It must be related to the I ads demise.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.120]   Now, are they going to do something else?
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.160]   It looks like they're just going to get rid of it.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.800]   It actually makes sense because if you're going to be the privacy company...
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   It does.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   It makes sense.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   You don't really want to be selling ads.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   Especially if you weren't making any money at it.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.280]   It's kind of like, "Well, this wasn't very successful."
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.760]   And they're pushing so much...
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.920]   This means that they're really...
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.160]   What they can say when it's closed is that we're really the company that we don't care
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   anything about you.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   We're not looking.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   We're not interested.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   We're not...
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   Right.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.520]   All we care about is that you have your privacy.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:59.240]   Because it does seem to be the thing that they're going to definitely push hard is that their
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.320]   users have the most privacy.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.040]   It also lets them have a little bit of a higher ground where they're talking about...
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.280]   Excuse me, products like Apple News, where they're saying, "If you want to use our ad product,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   that's fine.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.720]   We won't let anybody block our ads."
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   Right.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:25.680]   But as you say, if it were making Ghostbusters-level money, they'd find a way to preserve people's
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.080]   privacy or message.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.000]   It does set up the situation where they could...
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.760]   By killing it when they're killing it, it does set up a situation where they could rather
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.520]   than just making it available to block ads, really aggressively go after blocking ads
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.880]   even in the apps.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.800]   The thing is they could get much more aggressive about ad blocking if they get out of the business.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Exactly.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.760]   And then that just cripples the other ad networks.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.320]   Well, not necessarily until they counter move.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   Or they put it into the terms of use for the developers.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:05.360]   Well, not only that, it's easy enough for everyone who has an ad network to adjust their
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.080]   code so that if their ads are being blocked or the cookies are being denied, guess what?
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.480]   You don't get content.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   And just make that.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.720]   Here's what we expect of you as the reader and as the viewer of our free content.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Right.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.000]   So it's not as though this is going to solve the problem.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.720]   Something that even that big wouldn't solve the problem, it would only solve the problem
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.000]   temporarily until a business that makes a lot of money that's well motivated to continue
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.800]   to make money from this business on something that people are not willing to do without,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.000]   just simply adjust a little bit.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Well, the question is...
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Part of their...
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.760]   The question is whether Apple is pushing more towards a subscription model for all that
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   content.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.480]   So we want to push you away from using free ads and more towards paying a buck a month
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.840]   or whatever or paying into an ad network like, you know, or paying for it.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.120]   You know, that's the whole thing is doing move you towards that process.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.480]   They can push, but Apple is Apple, but they're still only Apple.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:01.600]   And I also feel like they use product because they don't control the up and the down.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.000]   If you look at Apple News, they're still...
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.480]   They're not backing away from the ads there.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.600]   They're just backing away from Apple being a source of the ads and giving them over to
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.840]   the individual companies and sort of Apple becomes the gateway.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.080]   It becomes like an API layer instead of an ad provider.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.920]   And I don't think they're going to do anything to get rid of ads in Apple News because that's
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.040]   sort of how the entire product has been built and positioned.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Right.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.320]   So as long as they have something running, it would be hard for them to remove it from
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.280]   apps if they're not removing it from something like News, which could be core to their service
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   eventually.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:37.600]   Plan to be in New York City starting March 31st because nerds, the musical opens.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.720]   The Bill versus Steve Musical.comedy.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.080]   "The little nerds from Harvard are we did little, did little, did little, did little."
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.440]   Philadelphia Daily News says nerds rules in a rocking, rollicking, send up smart, inspired
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.600]   performances any theater fan should enjoy.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.720]   You're very model of a modern major city.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.240]   Are you going to take the train up and go see it, Andy?
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.480]   I don't know.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.640]   I might.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.560]   There's a lot of theater in New York City.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   I might not get to it right away.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.160]   You can get $25.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.840]   You get $25 rush seats to the Metropolitan Opera after noon.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:24.240]   So I think on second thought though, if they just advertise this for the tag line, come
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.200]   on, you're not getting tickets to Hamilton.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.280]   We're just down the street.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.840]   That's accepted and see our show instead.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.480]   I think as our man on the street on the East Coast, it's your duty to see it and to give
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   us a proper room.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   I think you're right.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.000]   I think as a journalist, I think that they should send me cop tickets.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Will it help?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Does it help?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   In backstage.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Is it help?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.680]   If I tell you that it's being written by Jordan Allen Dutton and Eric Weiner who wrote
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.680]   Robot Chicken?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.880]   Does that help?
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   Yes.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   Oh, yo.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:04.320]   They also did a 1990 play called the Bombity of Errors and a hip hop adaptation of Shakespeare's
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.600]   the comedy of errors.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.680]   Oh, no, that was it, the Bombity of Errors.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.360]   So it's not pirates of Silicon Valley.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.120]   The musical is an entirely original construct.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   No.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   No.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:20.480]   And we as the Mac press do we now get to do lots and lots of blog posts about once again.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.680]   I mean, Steve Jobs never danced publicly.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   Okay.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.280]   Secondly, Bill Gates did, by the way, I've danced with Bill Gates and I know why Steve Jobs never
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   danced publicly.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.080]   Who led?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.760]   It was across the room we cut.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.600]   Our eyes locked.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.280]   He bit his lower lip, sticks his butt out.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   It's pretty invisible.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   It's invisible.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.320]   Last so I did he come to you or?
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   No.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.000]   He did the Bat Tousy.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Isn't that Tousy involved this?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Yes.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   How do I know that?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.960]   Shared Hollywood.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.920]   Are our rich cultural shared tapestry?
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.520]   As ours Technica points out, this happened this summer.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.640]   Just because the musical is called nerds don't think you can do what this guy did at a Broadway
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.600]   play called Hand to God.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.200]   Apparently his iPhone was dying just as a play was starting.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:26.080]   We crawled up onto the set and plugged his phone charger into the set even though it was
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.880]   a fake plug.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.120]   Well, you can't blame a man for that.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.840]   That's how desperate people become when their phone is dying.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.720]   That's a good ad for Mophie.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   They should.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.840]   I was just thinking that I was like, you know, I had that.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.680]   I had that thought and then I realized, wait a minute, I have a battery in my bag.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.960]   The show hadn't started.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.600]   But the crew did stop the pre-show music and have to make an announcement that you may
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.040]   not climb up on the stage.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.760]   I did stumble across this YouTube video of Rehearsal.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   Let's see.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.360]   Oh, is this for nerds the musical?
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.600]   Okay, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs comparing dance moves.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.120]   Is this one of those rap battles?
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.000]   I believe he's throwing shade if I'm not mistaken.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   There he goes.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   He is doing the last two.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   There you go.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You called it, Andy.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.640]   You lost the act right these traps for you too.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   All right, that's enough of that.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   My eyes.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   My eyes.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   You know what?
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.760]   We're going to, you know, it's going to be a huge hit.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.680]   It's going to be the next Hamilton and we're going to sit here feeling bad that we dissed
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   nerds.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.240]   I'm just glad that the I'm just glad that entertainment found two more roles for white
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   guys.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   I know.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:57.440]   Let's take a break on that note and come back with more Andy and Akos here Chicago Sun
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.440]   Times.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.840]   Yeah, when we come back, we're going to talk about where to get your next leather bag.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   Nice.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   We already brought the site to its knees.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.080]   Also here, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.960]   And from Sonny Winnipeg.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.800]   How cold is it in Winnipeg?
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Renee Richie.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   It's the coldest place in Canada right now.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.880]   I'm going to double check it.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.360]   It's gotten much warmer yesterday was actually cold, but it's minus something horrendous.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   Oh, pull up the weather app and see.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.800]   The only thing comes to mind when I hear the words Winnipeg is James Headfield of Metallica
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.560]   saying you don't ever want to go to Winnipeg.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.040]   It's minus 16 right now.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.760]   Oh, it's not that bad.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   Fahrenheit or centigrade?
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   It's probably so.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   I don't know.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   I probably Celsius.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   Well, it makes it different.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   It makes it different.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   Next, negative 16, and you still become above zero.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   Yeah, it's not zero yet.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   That's nothing.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.560]   That's Celsius in Fahrenheit.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   It is three degrees.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   Three degrees.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.480]   That's practically warm.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.920]   Why I remember a balmy spring day in Toronto when it was four degrees.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.880]   I couldn't stick out my tongue because it hurt.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.000]   Why did I realize it was because it was freezing?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.760]   Now you go outside and the liquid in your head starts to freeze.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   It starts to freeze rapidly.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.960]   Many people like to sit all day.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.360]   We're a sedentary bunch.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.360]   We geeks.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360]   Good for you.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.000]   In fact, the Mayo Clinic shows sitting, puts you at greater risk for a wide range of health
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.720]   problems, including obesity, increased blood pressure, and high blood sugar.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.560]   That's why I and many others have taken to standing at our desks.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.280]   If you've been interested at all on the standing desk, I think Renee is actually the standing
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   desk.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   He said he was on a treadmill.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.280]   I've got a suggestion for you.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   Verid desk.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   This is an easy way to convert your desk at work, even if you're in a cubicle to a standing
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.480]   desk, of course, actually standing and sitting, your choice, without having to get boss permission.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.280]   That's because the verid desk sits right on top of your existing desk or cubicle and turns
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   it into a standing desk.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.240]   There's no assembly, no installation, no boss approval.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.680]   It's a lot more affordable, too.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   It comes fully assembled.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.800]   You just pull it out of the box, put it on your desk, put your monitors and gear on it,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   too, because it's spring-loaded.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.920]   That means you can literally raise it with just a few fingers.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   It's a simple thing.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.160]   You just use the handles on either side.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.120]   The spring-loaded boost mechanism makes raising your monitors and keyboard effortless.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   It's also adjustable.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.520]   There are 11 different height settings.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.320]   I really like that.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.040]   And prices start as low as $175 with free shipping in the continental U.S.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.440]   If you've been wanting a standing desk, this is the easiest way to try it.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.120]   Right now, Life Hacker said Verid desk was one of their five best standing desks.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.240]   It's also featured on Producton and Gear Patrol.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   We've been using one.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.840]   If you want to get the same one, we do, which is really great.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.160]   We have the Verid desk ProPlus36 here at the Brick House.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.960]   Actually, people fight to use it now.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   Everybody wants one.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.240]   It's a really great idea.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   Our editors are sitting.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   They're slumping all day.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.600]   I feel bad for them.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.400]   It's nice to give people that opportunity.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   Here's the deal.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Go to V-A-R-I-D-E-S-K.com and check out their wide range of adjustable desks for your desk
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.640]   or your cubicle, your home or your office.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.820]   And make sure you tell them, "I heard it on Twitter.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.280]   I was listening to Mac Break Weekly."
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.520]   V-A-R-I desk.com.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.560]   Verid desk.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.480]   Thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:40.800]   I don't know if it's related to our discussions about Apple's offshoring of their text consequences,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.640]   but employees at the headquarters in Cork had to evacuate following a bomb threat.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   They're UCL 12 employees standing around.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   I think 4,000.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   No, it's more.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.600]   It's 4,000 workers.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.000]   It's not really any news, but there it is.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.040]   It's not like we're doing rich in news this week.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   We're waiting for my Apple Watch too, although I have to say, who was it?
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   Renee, I think it was.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   It said, "Just press record.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   Recommend it.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   Just press record."
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040]   Yes.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.360]   That has kind of revitalized my interest in the Apple Watch.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:21.680]   I made it a complication on my watch face and I can now just tap it and immediately start
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.080]   recording.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.880]   And I used it the other day.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.200]   A kid came in to interview me and he was going to write everything, tap everything into
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   his iPhone.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   I said, "Let's just record that."
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   I was able to record it.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.760]   It showed up not just on my watch, but also on my phone instantly and on iCloud instantly.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.600]   And I just emailed it to him.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.640]   What Lee was trying to say here is that all of the future TWIT podcasts are going to be
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.280]   recorded on my watch.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.440]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   So thank you, Renee.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   That was a great pick.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.080]   I got that from Serenity.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.520]   It's funny because Apple did not make a voice memo app for the Apple Watch, but they built
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.840]   the API for it so anybody could just package it up and make it smart.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.120]   The voice recorder and this one turned out really well.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.800]   It really did.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.960]   And so I'm going to take back, because I've been saying bad things about the Apple Watch,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:12.720]   but now simply because of that and because of all the heart rate monitors I use is the
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   most accurate one.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.880]   It's just a couple of things.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.600]   I have Aussie on my watch now.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.240]   And just having all the Aussie stuff there is fantastic because I don't have my phone with
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   me all the time.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   Right.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.560]   Aussie is another great reason.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.120]   You put in a glance, right?
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.680]   And you just flip over and there's your stuff.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.840]   So now I'm thinking, well, what would they put in an Apple Watch to in March if they would
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   announce it?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:41.200]   Although I think it's just because they announce it doesn't mean it'll be available in March.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.520]   What would they put in it that would make it something I would trade up for?
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.160]   Well, their bigger thing is not getting you to trade up.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   It's getting the person who hasn't bought an Apple Watch yet to be interested in it.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.160]   That makes sense.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.600]   And the rumor is an Apple S2 computer on a chip because it can get faster and more energy
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   efficient.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.640]   There's continued rumors of a FaceTime camera, although I don't know what my level of energy
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.960]   interest would be for a FaceTime camera on the Apple Watch.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.520]   It'd be nice to have, but not a must have.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.840]   And then there's just a few other hardware things that could do like a better Wi-Fi system
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.560]   so that it can access directly Wi-Fi better than it does right now.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   I stand corrected.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.480]   So if the coffee does not have a glance capability, I wish it did.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   But it doesn't--
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   Then I just pop up in the app and switch across.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.680]   Yeah, it launches fairly fast.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.600]   That's one thing I would do with that Watch 2 is--
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.160]   Watch OS 2 did not fix this fundamental problem of slow launching, I think.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:33.320]   What Watch OS did is they took-- so originally you had the interface on the Watch and the
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.720]   extension because it's built on the extension system from iOS 8, was on the phone and all
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.320]   it did is move the extension part over to the Watch.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.960]   So it's still an extension of the app that lives on your phone and is still bound by
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.560]   the processing power of the Watch.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.080]   And that didn't get any faster.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.040]   So you can have native code on the Watch, but the Watch itself isn't any faster than
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   it was before.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.540]   You remove some of the interruptions that happen with communication, but nothing that
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.960]   involves just CPU processing gets fixed.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.040]   So is there a reason why-- so for instance, with messages, it's super easy to respond
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.960]   and not for almost anything else?
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:10.640]   Is that something that the developers just don't have access to certain things or they
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   just haven't done it?
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.360]   So if someone sends me a text message, I get messages, I can just hit there and tap it,
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.880]   say it, it all goes back.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.040]   It's very fluid, but if someone slacks me, for instance, it's--
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.120]   I have to do-- I can look at it, but I can't really respond to it in the same way.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.720]   Is that a limitation of the API?
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.320]   Well, there's that same quick sheet that you have for messages response, which lets you
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.560]   dictate a response or quickly send an emoji.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:38.040]   That basic sheet that you see on messages is an API is available to everyone on any
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   app.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.480]   Yeah, so they could build that in.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   They do that for messages now.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.240]   It depends on how complicated the system is, but as long as notification comes in, they
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.040]   can have a button that says reply and they just pull up the standard sheet for that the
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   same as messages.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   I just want to know who to blame, because I'm really frustrating.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.320]   I'm just hoping for software where if I'm a smart thing else, if there's anything hard
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.440]   where I'd love to see, it would be whatever it would take to make it possible to have
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.120]   a true ambient display so that you don't necessarily have to turn your watch in order
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   to get the time.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.680]   There is a certain way that you use your-- when you have an app, an app, you can kind
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.000]   of do a certain thing with your wrist to make sure that it turns on, which is--
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Yeah, because sure--
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   --the great RSI eventually.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.240]   Because there are just so many times where-- this is something I appreciate about the
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:30.200]   Android Wear watch that if you turn your wrist, it'll go into the full mode display.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.000]   But if after a second or two, it'll go back into the sort of low power mode where it's
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.360]   showing you-- I don't think I can show you without activating again, but yeah, that
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   didn't work out well.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.680]   But the thing is, I can tell it's 3.06 PM even without having to wake up the display,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.640]   because we all have history with watches where I really want to know what time it is, but
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.560]   I don't want to make it look that obvious with this people I'm with that I need to know
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   what time it is.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.200]   So these little things that you miss.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.840]   I have to be able to just be able to design the watch faces would be the only feature
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.840]   that I really want.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   That's a thought.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.240]   That's a-- again, I can't think of anything that I'd like to see them do in hardware,
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   really.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   It's all about software.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   It really is.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.760]   And many of them are really fundamental things.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.880]   I'd like them to rethink.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:21.120]   I mean, I do-- it's easy to see that I think Apple really put most of their effort and
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.160]   time and energy into making sure the hardware was at least 95% where they wanted it to be,
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.480]   because they know that software is something you can improve pretty easily compared to
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.240]   deciding that you needed to have an extra button on this display or that you needed
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.360]   to have more RAM available or more CPU power.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.200]   I think they got it-- the hardware pretty much as right as they could have gotten it.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:49.000]   I would like to see the digital stem more useful, but otherwise I'm pretty happy with
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   the watch as it is.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.280]   I can't imagine what you use a camera for.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   No.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   I agree that--
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   I agree that going always on display would be so nice.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   It was a couple of things--
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   Yeah, it was a couple of things.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   --without killing the battery.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.560]   There was a couple of things like-- Georgia was pointing out too that she wears a lot
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.360]   of suits to work, and it doesn't quite fit underneath the cuff of her suits.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   So a little bit thinner would be better for her at least.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.560]   And the ambient display as well, because it's much more subtle than taking a phone out
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   of your pocket.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.720]   You're still doing a big flip movement, especially if like her, you're in a therapeutic situation
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.400]   and you don't want the client to think you're bored.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   Right.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   You're listening to them so you want to be able to just glance down subtly and see if
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   the time is good.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.480]   Or even just put your-- sometimes you even explicitly take your watch off and put it
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.400]   on the desk and put it on a table.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.200]   And that would be so cool.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.640]   And you really can't do that with the Apple Watch, right?
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.240]   Yeah, and that too is-- so many of these things are just the social interface that the
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.320]   watches have had for the past 100 years, that there are times-- if you take your watch
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:46.480]   off and put it on the desk, you're quietly saying that there is some sort of hard out
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.040]   that I'm looking at, but not so much that I'm going to be staring at the time all the
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   time.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   Right.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.040]   But you're right, Renee.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:51:00.320]   If Apple already blew my mind when they introduced this device with such a small case
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.960]   to begin with, if they were to make it even thinner and make it even smaller and make
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.560]   it even more attractive as a daily wear sort of thing, that would be the-- that would
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.480]   be the standout feature of any new Apple Watch 2.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:19.160]   So big that you would almost imagine that they would put aside every other new feature
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.640]   and idea in favor of just making the case smaller and making it easier for someone to
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.320]   integrate this into their wardrobe and their lifestyle.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.680]   Yeah, the thing with them is as far as my understanding is that right now the Apple S1
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.920]   runs at the thermal limit for that device.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   So they have to come up with some pretty fancy engineering to get it smaller and-- because
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.240]   people want the apps to be faster and they want-- customers are awful.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:45.000]   We want it to be thinner and lighter with a double length battery life with no bezels.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.400]   So with the Apple Watch, yeah, we want it thinner.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   We want it lighter.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.160]   We want it to last for seven days.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.560]   So being able to make an Apple S2 that's not only-- that is more efficient so that it
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   can process things faster but also doesn't take up as much space.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:02.680]   And then my biggest request is please don't change the band mechanism because that to me
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.880]   is going to cost me more money than you.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.600]   Apple would never change the design of a plug or connector that they buy all new everything.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.080]   They would never do theirs with a 30-pin dock.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   Just give me 10 years with them.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.120]   How many bands do you have now?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   15 maybe.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   Ah!
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.080]   Do you make sure that you wear a different one every day?
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.320]   You know, I did until I got the Hermes and then it's just-- the Hermes, to me, is just
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.200]   a little bit more trouble to switch so I don't switch it as often but I still switch it when
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:34.800]   I-- now that you compare two watches with Apple with the Watch OS 2.2, it's just easier
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.440]   to take the other watch that can much more quickly swap.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.840]   All my third-party cheap bands broke.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.880]   So I'm back to the Milanese Loop.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.440]   What is your Hermes, your favorite band?
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.680]   Yeah, it's just because it's so-- it's just kind of unique and it's also really, really--
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.960]   like you don't notice the difference and we-- I think Srenity did an article on the
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.560]   FOMES bands you can get on Amazon that are like 30 bucks.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.920]   But they're not double layer, they're not double stitch, they're rough on the back.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.240]   If you want the look but you don't care about how it feels, they're fine.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.000]   But there's a-- even Apple's leather strap is really, really good.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   They used really-- I mean they're expensive but they spared no expense in the sourcing
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.080]   of the leather and the materials and the finish and the workmanship they put into them so
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.600]   much so that they were massive delays in shipping a lot.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.840]   You don't have to get the Hermes watch to use the cuff though.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.600]   They sell them as a package.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   So you buy--
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.760]   So you had to buy the Hermes watch?
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.680]   You can't just buy the cuff?
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.440]   But Leo again, if you go to Hermes.com it's the cuff that costs way more than any watch
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.720]   does so I mean it's again it's a different world.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.880]   But I love like the Apple Steel link bracelet.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.240]   To me it's terrific and it's one of those things that shows the value of Apple entering
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.120]   a product category because my previous watch, my normal watch, I can't change the links.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.760]   I have to go to a jeweler or get one of those super jewelry sets that like people like Vince
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:57.160]   Nagoya or John Biggs use and I just not good enough to do that.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.960]   With this I press a button and I change the link.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   Yeah I do like that.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.520]   Well that's cool engineering but number one how often do you--
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.200]   I don't go through so many like fitness and weight fluctuations that you need to change
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.120]   the size of your wristwatch.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   And secondly those tools cost all of-- I bought it.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:20.160]   I did buy a knockoff stainless steel bracelet for my Apple watch and the kit costs about
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.680]   seven and a half dollars.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.840]   It breaks after the third time you use it but you're going to need to use it like once
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.640]   maybe twice as you make your first mistake in guessing what it is.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.520]   So it really is beautiful.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:37.120]   I will say that it does look like if I were to spend $500 on a stainless steel bracelet
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.680]   I would not-- it looks like something that costs a lot of money.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.840]   It's not just the links it's also the clasp I think that works nice.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.960]   Whether it will deliver $500 for the value to every user is something else entirely but
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.680]   that's up to the individual.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   All right.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   I played a lot.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   I'm not sure to do it.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.120]   You know I made it to loose and then the part rate thing didn't work so I made it tighter
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   than it was too.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.640]   So I did-- over the course of two weeks I did adjust it several times.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.920]   I never had to go anywhere to do it.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.880]   I just had to pop stuff in and out.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.320]   To me I really liked that because previously when I did that with a regular watch I just
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   didn't care.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   It didn't fit right.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.720]   I'd already gone there once and I just gave up with them.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.920]   Somebody's saying they really like the pad and quill cuff.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   That was a really nice--
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920]   Have you tried that one?
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.920]   Serenity has those--
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.720]   At least you don't have to buy an Hermes watch to use it.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.320]   No and they come in in variety of colors too which the Hermes cuff doesn't come in.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.200]   That's a nice thing about it is once you make a system where you can change the straps
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.840]   a lot of different companies can bring things in the market at every price point at very
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.720]   different tastes and fashions and it really to me increases the value of having it.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.280]   That's why I give Apple a lot of slack for this.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.360]   I think there's a limit to how foolish you can think some of these really super expensive
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:52.200]   Apple bands are because if Apple had made the connecting mechanism proprietary and tried
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.680]   to make sure that no one else could even try to bring a knockoff to market then it would
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.240]   be ridiculous to have a $500 stainless steel band and a $150 leather band.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.960]   But Apple I think is quite aware that they will make the high end stuff that they like
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.080]   to make that really excites them as designers and they're perfectly fine with other people
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.680]   making the $20, $30, $100 versions of it for people who either I don't have $500 to spend
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.320]   on stainless steel or like me will see these two things side by side and say why is that
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:24.640]   one costing $400 more even though it doesn't look as nice to me as the $100 version.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.560]   I also think it's really interesting that maybe I've been missing it but I just didn't
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.200]   think about how much customization you do with the watch band until the Apple watch.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.880]   When I bought a watch it was just the watch because a lot of times the way you would
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.800]   put it together was so complex and taken it apart and putting it back together.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.120]   You would never think about putting it.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.760]   I never thought about really customizing my watch bands until until until they could
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   just slide it on.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.520]   Yeah but you don't have 15 watch bands do you?
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.520]   That's not really at all.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.480]   I love that idea that even even I myself had three or four different Apple watch bands.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.640]   Some of them were just to test things out but it's also because you wear the plastic
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.440]   one because it's summer and spring and you sweat into the damn thing and you don't want
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.280]   to get everything gunked up but then you have that red leather band that would only
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.720]   wear for I only wore once or twice for a couple of like dressier occasions the Milanese
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:16.000]   loop that I wore when I was when it wasn't going to be quite a sweaty day.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.600]   It's great to be able to have to be able to swap these things out and have three or four
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.960]   different watches not just three different styles like that.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:29.720]   I think that it's silly when I wrote my review that I can't believe I'm actually taking this
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:34.200]   much time to talk about a watch band but it really is that interesting of a system and
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.880]   it is an interesting way to enhance the entire platform.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   We were just going to give you your stars of nerds the musical.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:47.640]   I'm actually curious what you think about this because it is a Canadian story from the
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.600]   CBC.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:58.760]   A widow in Victoria says Apple says you have to get a court order to access your husband's
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.320]   password.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   She provided Apple with all of the information, death certificate and so forth but Apple said
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:12.200]   I'm sorry we can't help.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.680]   You've got to go to court.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.080]   She gave Apple serial numbers.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.280]   She gave them the will, the notarized death certificate and they said court order.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.400]   That's probably a standing policy I would guess.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.120]   Yeah, I mean this stuff is also interesting because it is so new and we saw this a couple
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.000]   of years ago with inheritance rights for iTunes libraries where people wanted to take over
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.600]   the iTunes library and it was unclear about whether you could transfer the license and
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.240]   the companies weren't sure they wanted their music or their movies to be transferred.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.800]   All of this is brand new and from Apple's point of view this is probably a way to abdicate
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.920]   responsibility because if someone is ever tricked into providing this information they
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.040]   don't want to be sued because the worst thing is oh you gave up my password.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.040]   I wasn't really dead.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.040]   You got tricked.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.360]   I'm suing you now for $18 billion and this way it's very easy to say well the court issued
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.840]   an order and it has nothing to do with us.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.280]   We were merely following the court order.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.920]   Eventually I think it will end up being somewhere to what it is with banks where you have to
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.200]   go to a notary, you present the documents, they present you with the files.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.520]   The same thing that you'd give to the note to the bank to get access to the accounts,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.680]   the safety deposit box and to the other personal property of the deceased person you would
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.960]   present to Apple, to Google, to Facebook, to get access to those accounts.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.240]   But we just haven't litigated this stuff yet and that's how it works.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.880]   Sometimes it happens you go to court, there's an appeal, there's a bunch of decisions, there's
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.600]   a precedent set and then very slowly it sort of migrates its way into law.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.440]   She wanted to privacy.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.840]   It's not just about privacy, it's also about a state law that the executive in a state
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.240]   would for instance get the right to go into someone's office and take possession of papers
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.480]   and stuff like that and decide what the disposition of that stuff should be.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:53.040]   You can't have a land rush where every relative thinks that if you have three people who think
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.160]   that they have a right to all the photos and all the things that are on moms and dads stuff
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:03.400]   or the passwords to certain accounts so they can basically move things out of those accounts
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.560]   before things are taken control of it.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:14.200]   Sometimes you have to, it's just like the playground taunt of, yeah, well you go and prove
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:20.800]   it and going and prove it is the equivalent of going to court and having a judge decide
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.960]   what's right and what's wrong.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.840]   Nobody knows until there is that president established.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:30.960]   In this case he had an iPad, she says they shared, she had the unlock code but she didn't
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.200]   have the Apple ID password and she wanted to play her game on the iPad and Apple said,
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.800]   well you have to give us the ID as often happens on an iPad and the password she couldn't do
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   it.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:50.400]   Apparently the upshot of this is she went to a group called Go Public which is a consumer
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.240]   advocacy group and they contacted Apple, Apple apologized for a misunderstanding and offered
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:03.120]   to help solve the problem without a court order, it has not yet been resolved.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.280]   I think it is more complicated than hey he died, it's our iPad and I want to be able
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.040]   to get into it because-
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   I mean in these days-
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.920]   You don't get access to everybody's property and this is why, you know, you don't get access
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.280]   to everybody's property and this is why going forward for people who listen to this show,
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.320]   you really make a plan for this kind of stuff.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.480]   Yeah, definitely making a data plan is important because I think that it is.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.760]   It does put the company in a very complicated situation to just provide this stuff without
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.800]   a court- the reason you want a court order as Renee was kind of leads to is that let
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.160]   them hash that out.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   Just tell us what you want to do.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.560]   They're not trying to make it harder, they're just like we just want the legal side of this
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.680]   to be hashed out and then when you come to us-
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.040]   They're not questioning his death, it's not that, it's just do you have the right to this
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.600]   product and the context of this product is a much larger question.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.360]   And they're not going to have their lawyers all dig into, Apple doesn't want to apply
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.600]   all their lawyers to figure out exactly what that is, they want your lawyers to do that
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   and figure that out and then have a judge just tell them what to do.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   Exactly.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.200]   They don't want a vector for social engineering attacks either where you can just go to them
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.400]   and say somebody's died and have a few pieces of paper.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.880]   They want a process that's resilient as well.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   Right.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   Right.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.720]   I mean, it's nice if they had decided right before a formal policy of this is what we
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.200]   would expect in order to deliver this data so that it doesn't seem as though they're
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.400]   being capricious or unprepared for this sort of eventuality.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.920]   The simple and easy solution is a password manager.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.160]   I use LastPass.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.480]   They've added in the new feature in 4.0.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.960]   It's an emergency feature that lets somebody get access to your LastPass password and then
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   presumably in LastPass you've stored everything.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.800]   You might as well put your will in there to you but everything you want in there.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.080]   And then the process is clever because you in your LastPass settings say, "All right,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.440]   I will get an email when somebody requests this access, my wife or my lawyer requests
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.280]   this access and I will have a certain amount of time to respond and say no."
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.920]   So you can say, "Don't give them access for two weeks.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.480]   I mean, before you contact me and then wait two weeks, I said it to like a half a day
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.320]   because if I'm passed away, I mean, it's like a dead man switch.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.080]   If we send you an email and you don't respond, okay, we figure."
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.800]   The other thing they do is, and I use this too, is you can make a family shared folder
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.440]   and put everything in there that belongs, that everybody in the family should have access
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   to.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.840]   And then you can, if you have email problems like me where you just have so much email coming
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.320]   in and you're trying to manage it, you can set up an if this, if this, if this and that
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320]   have a little line to add.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.320]   And your office turned red if someone is going after your last class.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   You did?
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   I'll tell you that.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.800]   But it is, and you know, things might slip through the cracks.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.320]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff, but you know, your Facebook password, your Twitter password
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   only.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.040]   It's interesting to think about how you could sort of beef that up a little bit.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.640]   Like for me, it would be not only did I not respond to that email, but I have not posted
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.480]   to Twitter in an entire week.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:05.320]   I haven't had any activity on this IP address for an entire week.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.120]   It would be really easy for someone to be on vacation, and also on vacation, you know,
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   because they didn't buy the good internet package on the cruise ship.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.920]   That allowed the the the narrative, well, it's cousin to get access to it.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.040]   It's hard to it's hard to think about like exactly how to future proof all of that too.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.800]   So you work on all the stuff, because I've been thinking about it because I've been as
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.520]   a joke and then I became more serious, I was thinking of putting like a little QR code,
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.880]   you know, somewhere like if found returned to here.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.120]   And, you know, and I but I can't figure out what to do with it.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   Like do you send it to a web page?
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.560]   Will that last, you know, that kind of thing?
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.160]   When you start thinking permanent, it's hard to think about what that would look like.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:48.800]   Somebody, I think this Brian Brushwood created a, didn't he do a website like if he like
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.200]   it's activated if he dies and like exactly that like if you play it, it's great.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.080]   I might do that.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.640]   If I don't tweet for 24 hours, I must be dead.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.520]   The only one on that long order episode that it didn't turn out well.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.760]   So don't do that.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.320]   Well, that is isn't that also the premise of Daniel Suarez, a great novel, Damon?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.320]   Oh, big time.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   And I love those books.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.320]   Amazing books.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   A game developer has created this entire AI that goes into action upon his death.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.880]   It's fascinating.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.080]   And it'll scary as well.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.520]   So I'm glad we have a Canadian on because app store prices are going up.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.760]   In Canada, and they say Apple says it's because of exchange rate fluctuations.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.440]   I mean, the Bank of Canada was talking about that.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.560]   I think we're down at 69 cents or something US and they think it might go down to as little
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   as 59 cents.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.960]   The Canadian dollars were 69 cents.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.160]   That was something horrible like that.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.200]   I'm not sure what the exact value is right now, but it's just, it's been going lower and
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.520]   lower and there's all sorts of reasons for that tied, you know, to the oil industry and,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.080]   and, and things like that.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.960]   But these, these things do fluctuate when the app store launched.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.840]   It was at par for Canada and the US.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.720]   It was a dollar US and then Canadian.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.360]   Because they were close enough.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.360]   Absolutely.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.880]   I think now it's a dollar 15 and I'm not sure what it'll go up to, but maybe a dollar
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.240]   25 apps are going to be easy.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.560]   Things like software are going to be easy, but they were talking about how perception
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   has to be handled.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.400]   So for example, they're thinking of making entirely different car models for Canada so
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.280]   that you can't just look across the border and see the price disparity.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.080]   That's what they've done with cost code and with Walmart for years is they put variant
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.360]   models of refrigerators or washing machines.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.240]   So you can't do direct comparisons, but it's getting to that point and there, I think they're
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.760]   adjusting it in seven, six or seven countries.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.680]   So can the developer, I know that Apple has a plan for developers to set prices in emerging
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.600]   markets just to get in that market.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.000]   So apps are like, can be like 20 cents instead of a buck.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.920]   Do developers have input on what the Apple's going to charge in Canada?
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.200]   Israel, New Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and South Africa?
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.280]   They set a price and those are automatically converted.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.480]   Yeah, there's no greater Canadian support package available to it.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.320]   They alleviate our burden.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   Huh.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.480]   Well, this happens all the time and it can go in both directions.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.960]   It could go down as well.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.200]   Yeah, and they usually wait for like, they don't adjust it every day.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   I mean, that would be, that would be difficult.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   I think they definitely try to put it off as long as they can because it obviously creates
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200]   a lot of instability.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.400]   But typically it's when a new product is launched.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.280]   So like when they launched the next iPhone, they'll adjust it again in the different countries
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.800]   and they launched the next MacBook.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.440]   Their price will be adjusted in the different countries.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.040]   So they'll eat the difference for a while and that's why they do those massive hedge
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.040]   dealings they talk about on the conference calls.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.640]   Hey, should I, speaking of new MacBooks, I should wait, right?
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.080]   And it's not, you should always wait.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.200]   Anytime there's a possibility of an Apple event like March, I always want you to go
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.680]   ahead and buy them because you buy them and then they can.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.600]   But we haven't seen Skylake MacBooks yet.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.120]   No, no.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.280]   Skylake was only in the iMac as far as I can.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]   Okay.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.360]   So and Skylake would have benefits in a mobile platform.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.200]   Thunderbolt 3 would be awesome.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.280]   Thunderbolt 3 would be really awesome.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.440]   I think some PC laptops have shipped with Thunderbolt 3 already and that's sort of what
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.240]   we're waiting for now with the Mac laptops.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.160]   So Skylake, and we've been, I just got off the phone with Ryan Shrat this morning, right
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.360]   before the show because we're going to build the ultimate VR gaming machine.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360]   Over room.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360]   Over room.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   Nice.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.000]   On the new screensavers because we're getting our Oculus Rift in a few months and I want
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.840]   to have a turns out none of the Windows machines I have are powerful enough to use it.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   So I have to build a new one.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.200]   So I thought, well, if we're going to build a new one, let's build the ultimate virtual
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.760]   reality game machine.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.200]   So one of the first decisions you make is which platform, Haswell or Skylake?
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.600]   There are the faster processors are available on Haswell.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.680]   It's like with my Mac Pro.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.920]   It was a Xeon, right?
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.160]   Faster processors are available.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.160]   Actually, you know, I wonder.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.680]   This is a weird, if I ran Windows on my Mac Pro, maybe it would be fast.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.800]   You should absolutely check, but it's a weird year because Intel is not doing TikTok like
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   usual.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   They're doing TikTok talk.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.600]   So you're going to get Kaby Lake coming as well, which is built on the same process
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.840]   because it took so long to market.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.240]   So do you wait for Kaby Lake?
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.880]   We don't know quite when it's coming yet.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:10.840]   So that platform decision can be a difficult one, but Skylake does have some real benefits
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.200]   for mobile particularly, I think.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.680]   It's the new architecture built on the process that was introduced with Haswell.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   Right.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680]   Not Haswell, so it brought well.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   Broadwell.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.080]   Haswell was a big jump for mobile as well or supposed to be, but I don't think really
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.080]   anything.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:30.040]   Yeah, Haswell was the architecture bump after the previous process.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.640]   So bottom line, we should see new Mac books.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.000]   I would bet we'll see new Mac books.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.600]   It could be staged so far.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.720]   Typically, Apple has done some in March, some in June and some Macs in September.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.680]   I think it was a MacBook and the MacBook Airs, I think previously, were the other way around.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.720]   And then the MacBook Pros, they've done at WWDC several years, the MacBook Pros, but
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.560]   any time between March and June is usually not safe.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   Not safe.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.800]   It's an unsafe time to buy.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.040]   It's an unfair venture into the water.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.640]   Well, I mean, if you care, some people don't care.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.800]   Like I went ahead and bought a MacBook Pro the year before the MacBook came up because
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.320]   I knew that the MacBook wasn't going to have the graphics that I wanted.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320]   Right.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.400]   It didn't make a difference if it was going to get bumped or not because I knew basically
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   what I needed.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.720]   So if there's nothing in Skylake for you and nothing really in Kaby Lake, and for a lot
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.160]   of people, that'll be true.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.720]   You can take advantage of the sort of economy, the deals that you get as the platform ages
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   out.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.320]   Also, if you need something, you need it.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   Right.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   You have to be able to really think about that.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.680]   Again, I toasted my Mac Pro in November.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.320]   And I knew that I could maybe with the iPad Pro, stick it out until March, but that seemed
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.640]   like a very, very bad way to go through life if I'm going to be spending 18 hours a day
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.040]   on this thing.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.160]   And so you'll get by, it'll be fine.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.960]   Well, this is, yeah, no.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.480]   In fact, here's, this is a 2012 laptop, this 15 inch.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   And it's fine.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.240]   I'm not, this is from mid 2012.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.600]   So it's going to be about four years old, but that feels truth is I don't know if I
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.920]   would need to replace this.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.920]   It's an I7.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.360]   It's eight gigabytes of RAM.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.880]   There will always be better.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.400]   If you wait till March and buy it, the next year, there'll be another one.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.160]   Maybe there'll be a speed bump, six months later.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.480]   There'll always be something better.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.360]   This was pretty, this was like kind of top of the line when I bought it.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.240]   I have not had, really have no reason to get a new one.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.520]   I might have more reason if they change the form factor.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.920]   Do you think that will happen?
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:27.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.040]   I mean, I think the MacBook is a big hint at where the direction Apple's going with laptops,
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.440]   the same way the MacBook Air was.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.520]   But for me, for example, Thunderbolt 3 would be great because I've got an aging Thunderbolt
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.000]   display that's non retina and it doesn't have everything that I want on it.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.400]   And the idea of a 5K Thunderbolt display that sort of has all the latest ports on the back
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   and can do maybe has a graphics boost for the computers built into it because you can
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.320]   start doing it with Thunderbolt.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.880]   You can have graphics chips outside of the main chassis.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.720]   There's all sorts of interesting things that just having that interconnect or the new USB
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.960]   C design that also works with Thunderbolt.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   It opens up for you.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.720]   So for me, that would be a really interesting upgrade.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.760]   But if we don't see that, then it probably won't be.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.840]   I have to admit, I know it's probably becoming dead at some point.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.560]   But the USB C is really exciting.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560]   I'm going to my little Mac.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560]   I love USB C.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.560]   I have more and more USB C chargers emerging throughout my house.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:21.400]   The fact that it is not, it doesn't pop off when it gets pulled as a father of two kids.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   You don't like that.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.040]   I totally freaks me out.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.240]   That makes that USB C.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.520]   I know, even then, just anything sticking out that can't be just bumped off literally has
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.080]   me, I charge it in one, I charge it in my office.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.320]   I won't take it out in the room.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.400]   I just don't use my charger anywhere because I'm always afraid it's going to get bent.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.840]   And because it's something that gets kicked out all the time.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.520]   And so it's just a, I don't, I mean, I thought that that was kind of a stroke of genius that
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   they had.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.680]   I know Andy doesn't like the magnetic chargers very much, but I really do.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.400]   Yeah, they wanted to just like a neckline.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.760]   I like magnetic chargers.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:01.160]   So long as they actually stay affixed to device and it's still just the name of my pain.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.440]   But the advice that I always give and just more and more sturdy every year is that you
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.800]   shouldn't really buy new hardware unless you're very sure that it's either going to solve
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.280]   a problem or create an opportunity for you.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.800]   And oh, Andy, you're so practical.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.080]   Well, no, I'm saying that that's often that's often gotten me like you get that tingling
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.880]   in the back of your neck that says, oh, new MacBook.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   Oh my God.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.680]   It's like, OK, Andy, Andy, settle down yet.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.120]   Yes, you do have a thousand dollars that you could spend on this, but Andy wants.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.160]   What is it going to do that you can't do with your current one or what is it going to again?
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.600]   What problem does it solve what opportunity does it create?
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.400]   That's the great thing, though, is that that also meant that I didn't have to hesitate
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.920]   twice about buying an iPad Pro because that was like really fast answers to both of those
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920]   questions.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.400]   But yeah, we don't don't think that just because it's going to give you an extra two
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.680]   or three hours of battery life, unless you are in the problem of you're always running
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.760]   out of battery and it's impossible for you to find an outlet where you need to the fact
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.720]   that it's a faster processor unless it can let you do something on this device that you
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.360]   can't do with your old one.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.320]   That doesn't mean that it's stupid to buy this new version of it, but that at least
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.120]   should be a little bit of a cold shower to let you be a little bit more rational about
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.520]   what you're going to buy.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.680]   But what if I don't want to be rational?
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   Well, welcome to America.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.920]   It's about one Trump.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.640]   What Trump 2016?
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.840]   Yeah, it really is true.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.440]   I don't need a new Mac.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.240]   I really don't.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   Okay.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:29.200]   So we were talking last week about night shift in iOS 9.3.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.880]   You wrote a good explainer.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   Actually, Georgia.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.400]   Sorry, Georgia wrote a good explainer about how it helps us sleep better.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   And Georgia is a sleep expert.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   Yes.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.840]   So she's writing it from the point of view of somebody who really knows what they're
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840]   talking about.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.680]   It did have to do with blue light, right?
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.120]   Yeah, it's super fascinating.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.840]   So during the day, just like Superman and Supergirl, we are powered by the sun.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.920]   And as we soak it in, it builds up melatonin in our system.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.680]   And eventually that helps us tire.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.840]   And the melatonin levels rise during the night and that helps keep us asleep and get
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.280]   a good night's sleep.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.200]   What the shorter wavelength blue light does builds up histamine.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.240]   And that's sort of not only negates the melatonin, but it makes us want to stay awake and do
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.840]   more things and that interferes with our sleep level.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.160]   So unfortunately, a lot of electronics, like computer displays are towards the blue end
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.280]   of the spectrum.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.840]   So we're soaking in that sort of light, especially if you use the devices within a couple hours
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.720]   of sleep or while you're in bed, waiting to go to sleep, it's sending the entirely the
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.920]   wrong, wrong signal to your body.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.560]   So what this does with night shift is once you turn it on from about sunset on, it starts
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.880]   to shift the display towards the yellow, you can adjust how much from very subtle to
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   almost like pirate parchment yellow.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.000]   And that just means that when your eyes are looking at it, they're not soaking in those
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.320]   short wavelength blue lights anymore.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   That helps you stay ready to fall asleep.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.400]   Georgia does point out that that's only part of it because if you're playing stuff like
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.640]   highly addictive games or videos or social networking, the immediate gratification and
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.240]   buzz you get from that can still help you stay awake and avoid good sleep hygiene.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.360]   But this goes part of the way.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.160]   So if you're still acting responsibly, you're not going to be doing anything self-defeating
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.080]   while reading a few things before you go to bed.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.040]   But it is not a panacea, do not expect suddenly with iOS 9.3 to sleep like a baby.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.000]   I usually fall asleep right away and I'm still at the end of my day is always like 10 or
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.040]   15 minutes of just going through Facebook or bloodboard.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.000]   I think I've developed blue light immunity.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.440]   Well, it's not immunity.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440]   It's called Whisk.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.640]   How much better could it be if you didn't have that blue light sort of a thing?
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.960]   It's like, it's almost like a power bar in street fighter.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.160]   You're at half, you could probably be at three quarters if you did it a little bit better.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.200]   The folks who do go ahead, Danny.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.560]   I will just say that if you're not using a sleep tracker app, that might give you an
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.480]   insight into a problem that you need to solve pretty darn pretty darn fast.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.600]   I've been using one for the past two or three or four weeks and that no amount of sensible
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.080]   advice was able to convince me to when you go to bed, you're going to turn off every
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080]   single screen.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.920]   You're going to have the completely dark room.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.680]   You're not going to have like a light on the hallway.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.520]   You're going to have absolute distractions and you're going to try not to do any work
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.440]   a half hour before you want to go to bed anyway.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.680]   And only an app that gives you numbers that makes you want to beat your latest high score
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:19.160]   of a week of actually getting decent sleep is going to do that sort of stuff for you.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.720]   But I'm glad that it's always fascinating when you sort of are able to look 100 years
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:29.360]   in the past and realize that, oh, so they didn't realize that this thing they were brushing
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.000]   their teeth with was actually deducting 18 IQ points out of their head.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.920]   And they wondered why the entire population went insane.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.800]   So it's always interesting to think about what is it about these screens that we're staring
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.800]   out every single day?
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.280]   What is it about these radios that we're working with every single day that we might
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.720]   not figure out was a problem until 50 years from now?
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.000]   Now, which one do you use?
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.040]   It's an Android app of course, but it's actually have it.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040]   You'll sleep as Android.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.880]   Sleep plus for the Apple Watch is awesome.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:07.040]   It's really great when you compare it with an actual wearable.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.920]   Come on, don't scroll back.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.080]   That's why I scroll forward.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   You have big oaf.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.240]   Yeah, I think it's a sleep plus plus.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.120]   It's actually I've got a whole page of like health apps.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.120]   And so you just tap this button when you're ready to go to sleep.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.000]   And I did a dumb thing.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.800]   I bought a USB charger hub five port charger with a type C charger on it.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.480]   For the bedroom and has a very bright LED, which turns out to be blue.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.800]   So I'm actually beaming blue lighting in my eyes all night long, man.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.040]   I actually have a fix for that.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.040]   What's that?
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040]   Gaff tape.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   Yeah, I guess that's what I did.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   I taped over it.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.040]   A lot of people did it.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   That was so bright.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.800]   I thought, why do they put that on there?
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.440]   The thing is lighting up the room.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.360]   There's very few things that can't be fixed with enough gaff tape.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.720]   Is there anything it can't do?
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.920]   Loud children.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:19:01.520]   The folks who make F-Lux, which is a program that kind of started this for Android, had
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.320]   a response to Apple's announcement.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.720]   Apple announced this week they've joined our fight to use technology to improve sleep.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.840]   We're proud that we invented this.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.800]   We've done this for seven years.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   Welcome, Apple.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   Really?
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   Really.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.480]   Now we call on Apple to allow us to release F-Lux to iOS.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.280]   I guess they've been trying to.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280]   That's interesting.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.440]   Apple has prevented them from putting it on iOS.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.840]   Well, the APIs aren't public.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.800]   So the way to control the podcast that's playing and things like that.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.440]   No, it's not publicly available yet.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.840]   The same way brightness, I don't think.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.160]   There's probably a bit of available for a long time.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.160]   Yeah, news, Michael and Morna.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:44.240]   I don't think Apple's going to really do this for you.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.240]   I have used F-Lux on Android.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   I don't like it.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   It turns my screen kind of reddish.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.720]   I don't want that.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.360]   Have you used it on iOS 9.3?
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.760]   Have you used Night Shift?
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   Yes.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.920]   Does it turn the screen in a presubly yellow color?
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:07.000]   So if you go to display and brightness now, you have a new group of settings in there.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.040]   Mine is set to automatically do it, but I can turn it on now.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.480]   The basic one is very hard to tell.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.680]   It's just a very subtle yellow cast to it.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.440]   It's almost impossible to see.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:23.720]   But you can turn that up to full on pirate leather.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.360]   Pirate leather is right.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360]   It looks like leather.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   C'mon, argh leather.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360]   Argh.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.800]   Kind of the real one is subtle.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.440]   It doesn't just change.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.760]   It gradually as sunset happens, it gradually gets a little bit more yellow.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.720]   And then as it gets closer to sunrise, it gradually gets a little bit back to the blue
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   cast.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.360]   And you can set it to be-- the default is turn it on, turn it off.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.240]   You can set it to automatic based on sunrise, sunset for your location.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240]   Or you can set it customs.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:54.440]   If you say I just want it to be from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., you can set that up too.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.440]   It's pretty clever.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.640]   I feel like the whole thing's bogus.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.360]   But if George just says it's real, I'll defer to her.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.760]   I'll say if I read a book--
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   Well, I'll say if I read a book--
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.440]   If I read a book in the-- it's one of the features of being very dyslexic is that if
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.840]   I read a book before I go to--
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   No, it knocks you right out.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.840]   Within seven or eight minutes, I'm going to do it.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840]   Me too.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   My whole brain.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840]   And I'm not dyslexic, but it's very relaxing.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.080]   I can never get past the first page.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   I just got-- yeah, I get that--
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.280]   I used to read to my kids and I'd fall asleep before they did.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.280]   Yes.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280]   They'd actually album me.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.280]   He said, "Daddy."
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   Because I'd start saying--
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   So scary.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.880]   Because I'd go to this hypnagogic state where I'd start, "Yeah."
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.600]   Or saying weird things, the frog in the elephant roa.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.440]   And they say, "Daddy."
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440]   They--
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.440]   No.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.440]   You're not-- we're not done yet.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   Sorry.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440]   And again, it's not a binary state.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.600]   It's just the quality of your sleep.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.240]   And maybe it's only 10 percent better.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.680]   Maybe your sleep is good enough that the 10 percent won't be a difference.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.800]   But if it's already bad, you can help you get better.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.480]   Every time, you know, any industry comes up--
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.040]   "Oh, well, we figured it out.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040]   Here's the thing.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.280]   You put it on your eyes and the light gets blue and I don't buy it."
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.640]   There's science at the bottom of their response.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   There's science.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.960]   There's science in their response.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   And the science in their response.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:09.200]   Yeah, I saw there was a link-- there was links to why it's going to prevent cancer.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200]   Oh, well.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.480]   I was such fans of them before that.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.080]   Right up to that point.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:22.400]   Hand-recognition-- handwriting recognition on the iPad interesting article in Mackerel
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.480]   for Michael Simon.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.920]   He says, "Hey, you got a pencil.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.480]   Can handwriting recognition be far behind?"
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   Right.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.320]   Well, do we want that?
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   Yes.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   It works so well on the Newton.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.320]   Yes, but I don't know how--
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   Like a saw?
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320]   Like a snake is good.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.600]   Yeah, I would love to see it as a keyboard app.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.480]   I'm not sure how Apple could integrate it into the iOS UI without screwing up a whole
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.480]   bunch of things.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.880]   You know, I've used it.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.440]   Samsung Notes have it.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.520]   Of course, Windows has it.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520]   You use it.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.520]   It's kind of cool and then you stop.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.800]   I think fundamentally the problem is that my handwriting is so bad.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   Maybe that's my problem.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   That it doesn't do--
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   That's OK.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.640]   I don't think we necessarily even need to see magically handwriting converted into
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   text.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.680]   What I would love to do is to be able to take handwritten notes and then just that just
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.600]   becomes part of the metadata.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.440]   This is the software's guess as to what text this represents.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:20.520]   So I can search Evernote or search one note for these notes.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.880]   One of the things that surprisingly I find that I'm using the iPad Pro for a lot is handwritten
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.160]   notes because there's just so many ways in which if you're taking in a really large
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.520]   free flow of information from a speaker, say, you don't necessarily know if he's made
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:39.200]   a point on page eight of your notes that loops back to page two of your notes.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.000]   And it's impossible to-- even if you're using a great app like OmniOutlander, it's hard
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.040]   to sort of skip back and add things where it needs to go.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.040]   But with handwritten notes, you can put little symbols on or you put arrows and circles and
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:53.600]   little doodles that really help you out and scribble things back in the margins of things
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.400]   where you have room for it.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.200]   And it's actually when I'm on the phone in a briefing, I'm typically now taking notes
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.640]   on my iPad Pro with a pencil instead of just typing it.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.760]   And I would love to see that-- at least the-- I like to see the doors unlocked so that
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.840]   developers could take advantage of this.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.760]   If it's not necessarily something that's going to be hard-wared into iOS.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.800]   I think the thing is, it's like that-- you see in Korea, I guess they have some input
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.240]   devices that are really set up.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.400]   It was back when it was like canine or whatever and they'd set up the input devices for kids
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.800]   so that they could-- because they were so good at that and they were better at that
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.120]   than actually writing.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.960]   And I think that we're kind of moving down that path where I just don't know if my kids
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.440]   will just do that much.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.440]   Tina, you can't even follow it a check.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440]   I never have seen that.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.880]   Tina, that was like that would predict what you were going to type.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   But they were so good at it.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.920]   They have the devices like in the eight or whatever the kiosk was was built for that
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.080]   so they could use their thumb because--
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.120]   But they're better at it.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.800]   I tried to fill out checks the other day and I couldn't remember how to write because
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.800]   it'd been so awesome.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   No, I know.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.080]   You can only write or-- it's gone from-- I used to not be able to write cursive.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.840]   And now I don't remember lowercase.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.240]   So everything's just all uppercase.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.240]   So now I do uppercase and capital.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.840]   You guys are worried about blue light?
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   Right.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   You can't write anymore.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   No, it's funny.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.280]   Uppercase and then uppercase is actually larger uppercase.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.880]   You're like, I just-- like that's all I write.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.800]   It's like-- someone has like-- they were like, what's the uppercase?
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.920]   I was like, just the larger letters are uppercase.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.920]   That's how I do it.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.240]   I don't-- that whole like art.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.280]   You guys are not ready for the coming apocalypse.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.800]   Where's my keyboard, man?
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.480]   I need a keyboard.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:38.320]   So Apple admits, I guess, that there is some battery percentage bug in iPhone 6S and 6S
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.480]   plus the battery percentage not going down.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.760]   Yeah, so if you meddled with your clock-- and a lot of people do this because they play
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.280]   time-based games like if you play candy courses, wait a minute, cheap by just adjusting the
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.480]   clock, and that apparently in iOS 9 was screwing up the battery percentage meter.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.200]   So it wasn't having everyone.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.840]   It was just having the people who were--
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.880]   You manually changed the clock on your iPhone.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.040]   It was-- it would cause problems with the battery percentage.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:08.720]   If your iPhone 6S or a 6S plus battery percentage doesn't update, if you change the time manually
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.360]   or change time zones while traveling, it could happen.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   You might notice the battery percentage doesn't update.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.560]   So just restart your phone.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.760]   Or set time and date automatically.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   Yes.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.920]   And then we won't have this problem either.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.920]   So turn our back on again.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.400]   Go to play gamers out there, Leo, who are suffering from this.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.200]   That's why it's free to play because I'm still in 1958.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.760]   All right.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.720]   And good news.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   Just what you've been waiting for.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.320]   Microsoft says we're going to release the Windows Phone keyboard for your iPhone.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.800]   I thought to myself I was like, really?
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.080]   Why are we even telling you that?
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.080]   I could stop--
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.080]   Because it's for iOS now.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.880]   It's for the legions of Windows phone users.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   What a switch.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.040]   They want a switch.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.320]   They have a swipe feature.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.440]   But swipe has a swipe feature if you want to use it.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.080]   They're a part of keyboard with a swipe feature.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:01.880]   I don't know.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.560]   They were updating their apps today.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.040]   Apparently, they're going to just go increasingly into the iOS ecosystem.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.640]   I mean, they did Office on iOS first.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.040]   They really believe in developing cross-platform now.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.560]   They also believe that their Windows Phone platform is dead.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.600]   And if they want to be on mobile, they better do it on somebody else's time.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.480]   Well, they believe that their Windows Phone platform is dead.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.440]   And they believe that their Windows 10 on all devices with some justification.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.800]   I'm really fascinated by these sort of moves, too, because it seems like a not terribly
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.960]   expensive way to evangelize your platform.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.200]   It sort of infests another platform.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.240]   Just like I've always-- I think that once Apple allows independent developers to create
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.600]   their own watch faces, I think you will see companies like Omega and Hermes and all these
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.920]   high-end brands figuring out that they're probably not going to sell a $3,000 watch to
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.320]   a sport Apple watch customer.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.160]   But you can sell them a $3 watch face that has all of the pizzazz of Omega design.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.520]   And then they'll start to like that so much that when they're no longer 20, 21, 22 years
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.600]   old and now they're 30, 31, 32 years old, and maybe they do have enough money to buy
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.040]   a nice watch, they're going to want this wonderful Omega design that they've fallen in love with.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.360]   So it's interesting to see how evangelism can penetrate pretty much any cultural barrier.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.600]   I think Satya Nadella has said, too, and I think this is also true.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.080]   We want to be where our customers are.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.680]   And if our customers are using iOS and they are, then we want to make sure that we're
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.160]   there for them.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.480]   That makes sense when it comes to office, for sure.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.320]   Apple was putting eye books into Pinterest because that's where people are seeing them.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.040]   I mean, we're going to see this increasingly happen.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.920]   It just depends on what you think are the most beneficial platforms to you.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.960]   Do you know about this gatekeeper vulnerability?
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   Do you want to address this, Renee?
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.600]   I didn't have time to look at it.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.960]   It's the same one that it was just basically the way our gatekeeper was architected, and
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.640]   they have to do a lot of re-architecture to sort of shorten up.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.800]   And the finding that it sounds like is the researchers, from what I read in this article,
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:06.240]   the researchers reported it and the way Apple fixed it was just to block where the research
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.240]   was coming from.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.200]   They're like, "We'll just block that so that they see that it was fixed."
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.680]   And it's probably that it requires a lot more work, but it was just kind of an interesting
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.240]   way to fix it was just to block the places that the...
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.280]   It's an interesting exploit.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.920]   Basically, as you know, if you have gatekeeper turned on, if you can't just run an unsigned
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.880]   application, you have to manually open it and run it.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.760]   That's still true, but what it turns out is that a signed application can run an unsigned
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.920]   application.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:43.520]   So a malicious attacker could have a signed application that then launches a dangerous
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.520]   unsigned application.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.520]   I don't think that's a huge flaw because Apple still knows who the signed application is.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.040]   So the signed application is running unsigned malware.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.480]   Well, they could still trace it back to the original creator, which frankly is the whole
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.480]   point of signing.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.040]   So I'm not sure.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:07.680]   Anyway, the fellow who, Synac, security researcher Patrick Wardle, who disclosed this in September
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.640]   said that Apple hasn't dealt with it yet.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.840]   They reverse after the release of the patch.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.840]   He noticed the actual vulnerability wasn't addressed.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:24.640]   The company just blacklisted the binaries Wardle was using to demonstrate the issue.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.160]   You know, I guess there's...
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.600]   You could see a tax scenario, so it needs to be fixed, but I don't think it's going to
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   be able to...
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.880]   And it's going to be a process because there are certain things that are just architecturally
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.520]   tough to do, and they're going to put out as many bandies as they can at first.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.400]   And they have to make sure that the fix doesn't break a lot of other stuff, and especially
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.280]   when it's a gatekeeper level.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.520]   If it stops signed apps running, we saw when they were just trying to move to SHA2 for
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.760]   the app store, how many things that broke.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.640]   So I think they're going to be careful about rolling out big architectural changes, but
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.720]   they're going to try to patch as much as they can as they do it.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:05.200]   And finally from Scooter X, in the category of how long will this product be on the market
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.240]   before Apple decides to sue them out of business?
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:14.400]   This is Scooter X says he just got his today from MilkModern.com, the Steve Jobs One More
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.600]   Pin.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:22.200]   It's a pin with a face of Steve Jobs and the word Jobs on it, which maybe gets them off
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   the hook.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.400]   It's limited to just a hundred, just a hundred, and they're only $9.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.000]   You know what, I wouldn't mind having...
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   Oh, I get it.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.920]   That's the pin, not that.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.120]   This is the pin.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.040]   So it's Jobs' head on your jeans.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   Or on your suit jacket.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.680]   Actually, I wouldn't mind that.
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:43.200]   You got that Scooter X?
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.200]   I'd like to get that.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   That actually is pretty sweet.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.040]   You know American flag with Steve Jobs variant?
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.360]   Yeah, forget the American flag.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.720]   I'm going to put Steve Jobs' head.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.720]   See, there you go.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.200]   Then Donald Trump will punch me in the nose.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.200]   It's all...
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.840]   You better hurry up because we just talked about it on the show.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.440]   Oh God, there was only a hundred.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.880]   We've just sold them all out, I'm sure.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.280]   I just bought two.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   Update cart, check out.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280]   Stop it.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280]   Stop it.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.280]   Don't, don't.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.800]   Oh, last pass, Phil.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.600]   Phil, Phil, Phil.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.600]   Oh.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.640]   Your order will ship in three months.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.720]   Oh, you think it's back ordering?
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.800]   They only going to print home like God.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.800]   Now they want...
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.800]   Everyone knows that you're racing.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.800]   So there's...
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.800]   It's the most order before you tell them.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800]   No, everyone's racing.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:25.800]   So just imagine there's like a thousand people
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.800]   that are typing as bad as they can.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.280]   They can type faster than me.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.480]   I can only type in uppercase letters now.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   No, that's you.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.480]   Okay, wait a minute.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480]   Ugh.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.080]   Shipping or handling, subtotal.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   Pay with PayPal.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.840]   Oh man, where's my dongle?
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.680]   What a time to lose your dongle.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.680]   Oh crap.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   What do you do with your dongle if they get rid of the headphone jack?
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.040]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.400]   Wait a minute, they're going to send me a text.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.120]   Okay, where's my phone?
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.440]   Send me a text.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.720]   This is some quality Mac break.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.600]   I knew I should have turned off two factor authentication.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.160]   It's quality radio.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.720]   Let's just see, can I get it in time?
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.480]   Did it securely log you in?
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.640]   Pay with PayPal, pay now.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640]   Enter's the frame.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.520]   Well, it looks like I know Alex's changed.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   Thank you.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.720]   Your order has been received.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.280]   But now I'm going to get a...
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.280]   I got one for you.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280]   Thank you.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:32.520]   Now I'm going to get a notice that says, "We took your money, but we can't give you
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.520]   your time."
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.120]   Oh, look, they also sell a leather watch.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120]   Oh, they're...
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.320]   Unfortunately, we've already been sued.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.920]   You didn't order it fast enough.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.120]   I'm really not trying to beat everybody else.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.120]   I'm trying to beat Apple.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.480]   All right, folks, time for a break.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.560]   And we shall continue on with your picks of the week.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.880]   So prepare your picks.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.360]   Get those picks ready.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.720]   Meanwhile, I want to tell you a little bit about squarespace.com.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:04.080]   This is one for the sophisticated squarespaces for everybody.
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.800]   It's the greatest place to make a website.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800]   And I just have to...
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.040]   You know, Jason Calicana said this.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   That was so right on.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.600]   He said, "You'd be nuts nowadays to go out and have a bespoke custom-made website."
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.040]   It's just hundreds of thousand dollars.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.600]   I know, because we did it.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.960]   And where you go to squarespace, and for nothing, you're getting these top-of-the-line
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.280]   designer templates with the best state-of-the-art engineering.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.000]   So you got mobile responsive design.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.360]   It looks great on any screen.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.600]   The backend is all there.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   It never goes down.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.600]   It's the best hosting.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.840]   He said, "It's just nuts to go get a custom-built site."
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.960]   Because you can get a custom-built site that looks beautiful, professional, for so much
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.800]   less at squarespace.com.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.240]   Whether you're a photographer, you want the perfect portfolio, a band that wants a great
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240]   site for your band.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.640]   They have performance calendar.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.560]   You could sell your music online.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.560]   It's just awesome.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.160]   A professional blog, an online store.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.960]   In fact, every squarespace template has commerce built in.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.200]   And not one of them crap-looking shopping cart that you tack onto your site doesn't
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.920]   look like your site anymore.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.320]   It matches the aesthetics of your site.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.600]   It is a perfect complement to your site.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.560]   Now, of course, you don't have to do any coding for this.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.640]   You don't even have to know your CSS from a hole in the ground.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.080]   You just click and point your way to a beautiful-looking website.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:33.600]   But if you want to get geeky, they do have a squarespace developer platform that is amazing.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.840]   You get full control over HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.040]   There is a JSON API.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.360]   You have a CMS that you can actually call.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.880]   You can start with one of the beautiful existing squarespace templates.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.680]   They are so great, but you could also start with a base template and do your own thing.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.280]   Once you register as a developer, flip the developer toggle.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.040]   You can even use SFTP or Git and do it that way too.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.600]   Wow.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.480]   I love squarespace.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.480]   They have made a-- that's my site, leoville.com.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.600]   I'm using the cover page feature on squarespace, which is awesome.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.600]   By the way, with an annual purchase, you get a free custom domain.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.560]   Power your business with squarespace commerce 24/7 support.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.160]   I just love it.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.440]   Start your free trial squarespace.com, but do if you buy it, use the promo code MACBreak
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.600]   and you'll get 10% off and of course show your support for the show.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.040]   Squarespace.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.960]   You should.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.760]   You should.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.240]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240]   Let's start with you.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   You're right here.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.880]   You're in the-- Oh, you're looking at Saddleback Leather.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.880]   I was.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   I got you started.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.880]   Oh, look at that.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   What do I get in my bag?
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.880]   You can get in my bag on Saturday.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:49.880]   You can see if you like it.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   No, it sounds great.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:51.880]   But that's their camera thing.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   Yeah, those camera things.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   But they don't have partitions, so you'd have to make your own--
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   Yeah, that stuff.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   Pick and pull.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   You taught me about pick and pull.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   I wouldn't put pick and pull into a leather case, though.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   You have to make it handcrafted with real wool.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.880]   Oh.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.880]   Like wool.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   Wool.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   Wool.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880]   That's wool.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.880]   That's my story.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   I'm sticking to it.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.880]   So I grew up in the country and on farm.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   You're a country guy.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   And for us, knots, you know, we used a lot of different knots.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:19.880]   Keep shank, half hitch.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.880]   I mean, all the-- you know, I actually love knots.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.880]   I love knots.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.880]   I love knots.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.880]   I wish I knew knots better.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:30.720]   So I had a-- I was like, man, it would just really be great to teach my son and all these
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.720]   knots.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720]   And some of them I can remember, some of them I don't remember as well and everything else.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   You know, that app.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.880]   I was like, there's got to be an app for this.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.880]   And so I bought all-- I did-- the service that I do for the Mac break, I bought all the knots.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.880]   Apps.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   So I just bought them all.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   Just to see which is the best.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:44.880]   So you decide which one is the best.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880]   And now we know which one is the best.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   Which, in my opinion, is knots 3D.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   So knots 3D animates the knots.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.880]   So this is exactly the thing that I wanted to do, which is you have 3 knots.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880]   You can really see what they're doing.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   A lot of other ones have--
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.880]   It's very hard.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.880]   --video.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:00.880]   It's very hard to figure out how to tie something.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.880]   But the 3D aspect of this really works.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.880]   And so what you-- and you can actually take it and scroll it.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   And you can scroll back and forth and watch the knot kind of forming.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   Oh.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880]   So you go, what is that?
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880]   I mean, you can-- you know, there's a-- and there's like--
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.880]   Oh, it's--
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.880]   I don't know how I know.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.880]   See, look at that.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.880]   And you can drag on it and it will show how it's going to--
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:19.880]   Kind of need that, don't you?
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   It's really-- it's-- you know, I mean, it could be a little more designed to it.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   You know, like, they could work on that.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.880]   But as far as the functionality of this, and there's a little 360-widdle rotate.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.880]   Now, I wish you could animate it.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.880]   I couldn't figure out a way to get it to animate the knot building while rotating in 3D.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.880]   In 3D.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]   But--
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:38.880]   You should help them with that.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.880]   Is there a way to do that?
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.880]   I mean, I don't know about it than I do at this point.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:43.880]   I mean, they're doing really-- they're doing a great job inside of it.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:48.880]   But there's just about any-- I mean, I couldn't think of a knot that I couldn't find in there.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.880]   I don't even know what it used a lot like this for.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.880]   But-- but anyway, but it gives you a little explanation of what that is.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   And it's just-- and it's using-- I think it came from a classic knots manual that they actually kind of based it on.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   But anyway, if you're into knots, I-- you know, it's--
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.880]   Every--
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.880]   I know it's obscure, but there's something-- I think there's a high correlation of--
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.880]   of geeks and knots for some reason.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.880]   Because it's topology.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:14.880]   That's why.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.880]   Yeah, and it's got a-- and all of them, for the most part, are utilitarian.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.880]   You know, there's some reason that someone built that knot.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.880]   The Blake's hitch.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.880]   And used it often enough that it ended up in a bullet.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.880]   I want to do the monkey's fist.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.880]   That looks good.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.880]   By the way, they have it for the iPad, too, which is probably what you should do because--
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:30.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880]   --then you get the really-- the big screen.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.880]   Anyway, it's great-- great little app.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.880]   And it's the-- You'd like to facilitate your use of cordage in the field.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.880]   This is for you.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:49.880]   Well, the funny thing is that I think that is-- this is where I think we're on our way with education and so on and so forth, is that there's going to be stuff like this for everything you want to learn.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.880]   That keeps on getting better, where it's just this interactive way to kind of put it together.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.880]   I was talking to-- so-- Lisa's cousin, it does truck repair.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.880]   He drives one of those big tow trucks out to the truck to fix it.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]   Right.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]   And so he's really quite expert in this.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.880]   I mean, he's brilliant.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.880]   And he said, you know what's been a huge boon for me?
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.880]   YouTube.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   Right.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880]   I said, wait a minute.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.880]   You can find, like, obscure, difficult repair jobs that you don't know on YouTube.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.880]   He said, everything is on YouTube.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.880]   It's crazy.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.880]   There's nothing not on you.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:24.880]   There's the monkey's fist.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.880]   That's my new knot.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.880]   If you see monkey fists tied in all of our cordage around the studio, you will know what's going on.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880]   You will know Leo's been there.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.880]   I don't know what good it's for, but it just-- it looks cool.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.880]   I'll show you how to do it.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.880]   You know, because you're a sailor.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880]   Exhaler, yeah.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.880]   Jason Clanthes, our producer, was in the Navy.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.880]   Yeah, you can either get the app or just sign up for four years with the US Navy and they'll teach everything you need.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   Do they teach you knots in the Navy?
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.880]   Yeah, in boot camp, yeah.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:52.880]   Really?
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:53.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.880]   Like, you're going to be tying up the boat?
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.880]   Well, because if you haven't identified your class yet, if you haven't identified your insurance, you want to go.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.880]   You don't know.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   Maybe you will be tying up the boat.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.880]   You might be a boast's mate and you might be tying up the boat.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.880]   They still have boast's mates that tie up the boat.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:07.880]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.880]   Do you know the monkey fist?
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.880]   Yes.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   I haven't made one in years.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   Do you know what it's for?
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   It's a good weight on the end of the line for throwing a line.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.880]   Ah, perfect.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:16.880]   There we go.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:17.880]   I throw lines all the time.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.880]   Yeah, when I'm throwing a line, this is going to be one of my years.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.880]   You can even put a weighted core inside to help you out.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.880]   Jason, I don't know.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.880]   I don't need the app.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.880]   I got you.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.880]   Let's have not class a little later on.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.880]   See, but the key is the next one.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.880]   You want to impress Jason's.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   I know that's important to you.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.880]   There you go.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.880]   What you can do is secretly learn them.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.880]   You can just do them in front of him very much.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   There's a club, Molly.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.880]   They make a great key chain.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.880]   You need a club, bitch?
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.880]   I got one.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:44.880]   Oh, you know what?
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.880]   That's where I know this from.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:52.880]   I had a friend, an elderly gentleman, who would tie these for us as bookmarks.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   I mean, that's where I know that from.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:01.880]   If you do it with a small enough thread, you can make real intricate, delicate versions.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:02.880]   You're picking it.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.880]   By the way, Buck 99, iOS, but also Android, Nook, and Kindle, apparently.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.880]   That's nice.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.880]   I've got a tip this week, and I sat down, and I did this originally, but then I went down and
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   read it again for iOS 9, and it's basically all the shortcuts that they've built into Safari for the iPhone.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.880]   I know these work on the iPad, too, but primarily if you're on the iPhone and you want to make
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:29.880]   your browsing faster, the Safari team at Apple has built in a ton of little gesture shortcuts.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.880]   People know the basic ones, like tap at the top of the screen to go all the way back to the top,
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.880]   but you can hold down on the back button to get a list of your history going backwards,
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:43.880]   hold down on the forward button to get a list of your history going forward.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.880]   You can hold down on the bookmark button to get a bunch of quick bookmark options.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.880]   You can hold down on the reload button to reload the page in the desktop version or to reload it without
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.880]   the content blockers.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.880]   There's just all these little things you could do.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.880]   There's find on page, there's print to PDF.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   A ton of really quick ways to get through your browsing on the iPhone.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:05.880]   Just built right in.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.880]   People know already flicking away web pages, reordering web pages, but you can also, for example,
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   scroll down and see the iCloud bookmarks on your computer and swipe to close those remotely.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.880]   If you left home, you didn't want a certain tab open.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.880]   You could just flick up, swipe that, delete it, and it'll disappear from the Safari browser on your desktop.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.880]   There's a whole bunch of these things.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:29.880]   I've got, I think, 16 of them here for people.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.880]   All of these have made, it just becomes muscle memory after a while.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   It makes you so efficient.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.880]   Almost everything now does peak and pop, too, if you have an iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S plus,
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.880]   the shortcuts that they give you, the suggested sites, the bookmarks, the reading links,
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.880]   all of those you can peek at before you commit to going to the page so you can very quickly
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.880]   see all the content and decide which ones you really want to go to.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.880]   If you do use Safari on iPhone a lot, this is just a really nice way to speed up everything
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:56.880]   that you do on it.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.880]   That's the real mark of a power user.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.880]   Somebody who just never takes their hands off the keys.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880]   It's absolutely right through it.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.880]   You got a monkey's nut.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.880]   And then I go, "Your turn."
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.080]   Going back to a topic from a couple of weeks ago, still looking for really good Apple pencil
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:16.080]   cases.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:21.200]   Some people recommended this tip a couple of weeks ago, thanks to my friend Trish, that
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.880]   you buy a set of kids' chopsticks.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.880]   It will carry it in a lunchbox.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:34.840]   It comes in this really cool case that happens to be the chopsticks tend to be 18 centimeters
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:39.360]   long, which is about almost exactly the same length as an Apple pencil.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.640]   So you wind up with this perfect Apple pencil case.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.120]   And so you need to buy more pencils now to comment in all the cases you have.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.080]   Now that some of them are ready.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.200]   And so you can find them on eBay, you can find them on Amazon, anything that's designed
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.520]   for chopsticks that are 18 centimeters long, global almost perfectly.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:05.800]   But I now have a new favorite sort of not intended to hold Apple pencil cases, pencil
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   case.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.600]   What you do is, this is a little bit more DIY than buy this thing off of eBay and just take
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.800]   out the chopsticks and put this thing in here.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:21.200]   What you do is you buy a loose-site tube that is three quarters of an inch in diameter with
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.440]   an inside diameter of one half inch.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.520]   You cut it to about little over seven inches.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.520]   And then you have, it's the exact right thing for the Apple pencil.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.960]   Now how do you keep it in there?
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:41.760]   Also, from the same, I'll also on eBay, you can buy these little final plastic caps for
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.480]   three quarter inch tubes.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.440]   So you put that on one end, you put your Apple pencil in and you put the other cap on the
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.040]   other end.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:57.360]   And you wind up with this actually quite attractive sort of like futuristic Star Wars almost
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:03.160]   level Apple pencil case that's almost exactly the right size, almost exactly the right length.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.760]   And it's pretty darn cool.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.080]   And it'll protect the thing.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.680]   It'll make sure that the tips don't get bounced out.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.240]   The caps stay on securely.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:16.320]   And it's a tube that I buy these tubes for about $7.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.160]   The caps are about $2.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.960]   And you can easily like get enough for three for like less than 20 bucks.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.880]   Some of these sellers will cut it to length for you if you tell it how long.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.600]   Some of them also have them in different colors.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.960]   You can get like a clear red or translucent yellow or something like that.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:42.080]   But I think that the having it just this black and clear thing just actually is I think
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.240]   Johnny I would he wouldn't approve, but he wouldn't disapprove so much that he drive
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.960]   a truck through my house.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.280]   So it's just this.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:55.560]   So this is now this is now my favorite solution for that because I just I just enjoy it.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.320]   And also it's it's good for pretty much like every other kind of stylist you have.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.080]   I thought I had the.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.880]   Is it TSA approved?
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   Well they can look through it.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.640]   It also doesn't hold that much liquid.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:16.000]   So here is like you can also I have saw the least stylist for my my loner surface pro
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.800]   for on this thing.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.560]   It's not a little bit too long for this.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.920]   I could trim it down a little bit, but it's just nice storage.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:25.920]   You can put it in your pocket.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.640]   You can put it wherever you want.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.640]   Alex is a believer.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.520]   I love he but I will say I will child's pencil case.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:36.200]   I got the child's the child's chopstick one with a little bit of money rabbits on it,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.440]   but I'm looking for other money.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:43.360]   I will say like I found another one of these, which is I don't know what make what make
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:46.240]   this is, but this happens to be like the best one I found.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.240]   It comes with a little plastic insert for the chopsticks, but you can pull that out
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.240]   completely.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.120]   So I bought a second one of those.

[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.920]   We're the hub of the universe, which is not an arrogant thing for Bostonians to call themselves.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.920]   Oh, the hub?
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.920]   The hub of the universe.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.240]   It's cold enough that we can wear our like main hunting guide cosplay, but not so cold
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:56.440]   we have to huddle in underground bunkers for fear of the ice giants coming to kill us
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:57.440]   all.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.600]   That's what that's what they do in Winnipeg.
