[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers everything
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   going on in the world of Apple, from Cupertino to South Cupertino,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   ladies and gentlemen, here are the stars of our show.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Today, Alex is still in Africa.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   In fact, he's in transit, so no bandwidth for him.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But that's fine because we've got a great cast of characters
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   starting with Chris Breen, the Mac Daddy from Mac World Magazine.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He's a senior editor over there at MacWorld.com.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Hey, Chris.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Hey, Leon, how are you?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I love the set.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now, every week that you're on, you're going to feature
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   a different album on the wall behind you there.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, last time I was on, we're only in it for the money
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   by the mothers in the dimension.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And today we have Klaus Schultze's Mirage album.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Wow, I don't even know that.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Is it progressive?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It is.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's 1970s electronic-like Tangerine Dream.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, I love Tangerine Dream.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   That's good.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So it's like--
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's before they went really commercial.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's like one better.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Merlin Manz, a guy going, "Ooh."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Ah, for 43folders.com.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He has a cream-colored backdrop behind him.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I had some of my daughters art up.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It fell.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It fell off the wall.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Well, it's a little abstract for this crowd.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It was a little bit like Tangerine Dream.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And next week I would bring something with hers
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   that has an excellent negative capability that will be less
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   conceptual and more representational,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   perhaps something you can handle.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I could do with some figurative art.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Speaking of figurative, here he is.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Sorry.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The Glum-Faced Andy and I are covering the Chicago
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   set in times.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Good morning, Andrew.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I was just taking a moment to reflect on the uselessness
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of daily existence and how shows like this are just a way
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   to distract ourselves from the larger issues and the
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   smaller issues that render all of existence so very futile.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Thank you, John.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Thank you, Paul Sartre.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Horkheimer and Adorna.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So very, very futile.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   This is what-- this is why, you see,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Mac Break Weekly is the most intelligent show on the Internet.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Or soda.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And he's just depressed.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He's just a little depressed.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   A little more phosphoric acid.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Let's see.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Well, there's a new MacBook.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They finally revved the MacBook, the white polycarbonate
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   MacBook, to be actually pretty close to the 13.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I would say that at this point, it's kind of a push between
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   the two.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   They've added the Nvidia 320 mobile chipset,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   which is a big step up.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Have you played with it yet, Chris Breen?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I have not.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I saw the news out of Vietnam last week that this was coming out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And so to me, this is just old news as it is to most of the Internet.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   You have a background.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Chris, do you have a background in improv?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Because you're yes and.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yes and.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He's good.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's not a no but.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He's a yes and.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yes and.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yes and.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yes.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   No, they did.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.500]   battery life. Yeah, I mean, this is sort of what they've been doing. They keep been keeping
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.020]   the plastic one out there. So for people who need that plastic and want that 1000 ish dollar
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.080]   price tag. It's a perfectly nice laptop. I mean, the nice thing about these plastic ones
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.800]   is that they're solidly built. They've got good battery life now.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.900]   10 hours. 10 hours and they perform really well. So it's not like you go in and you feel
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.660]   like you're buying the, the Play School laptop and like, well, at least it's got the Apple
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.360]   logo and I got the two little stickers in here. So that's good. I think it's as if false for
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.040]   schools though for education, things like that. That's what that's the price point.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.320]   Well, not not only that, but that's a big deal to have something even $1 below $1000. That's
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.840]   one big gap that still remains in the MacBook line. It's a little bit off putting that Apple's
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.160]   way of doing the cheap MacBook is to build something that is still as expensive as, but
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.740]   if also the same high quality as a low premium model Windows notebook. I mean, if you want
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.940]   to, if you walk into a computer store with 1000 bucks to buy a Windows machine, you're
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.580]   definitely in premium class, but at least, at least they're trying. But that's my, my
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.740]   aunt, I bought my aunt that same model about a month and a half, two months ago. And that's
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.820]   exactly how I had to put it that it's 1000 bucks as opposed to 650 for Windows notebook.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.260]   But this is the, this is the equivalent of any premium Windows machine you would buy.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.640]   There's no pressure really on Apple to meet the Windows PC prices. Is there? There should
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.980]   be. I mean, it's not, it's not that there isn't pressure. It's just that they feel as
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.180]   though they've given up on that. It would be great if they could simply say, you know,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.280]   what Dell, you stop making the mini 10 V. What if we were to license that slap a logo
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   on it, make it only available through education in blister packs of 10 and we could sell them
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.200]   to schools for 500 bucks a copy. That would be interesting development.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.320]   It was kind of a precedent for that. The email was a new no S four schools was cheap. Yeah,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.360]   but it was too much. Exactly. I mean, it was, it was nice for what it is. I have one upstairs,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   as a matter of fact, but it was really was a solution in, in, in, in chasing after a
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   problem. I don't, I think people really want to have a Mac that they only have, they only
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.760]   have five or six or seven hundred bucks in their pockets to spend on a notebook. They
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.040]   might want a thousand dollar notebook, even though that's the cheapest one, they still
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   can't afford it.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.520]   Well, I'm, I mean, I have no nothing about, I have nothing, I have nothing inside information
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.040]   on this, but you think about a store, think about when you go to like the electronics
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   district in New York, Manhattan, and you go, you know, whatever DVD player, $35. Well,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.400]   you know, you only really need to have one of those in the store sometimes to say that
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.440]   you've got a $35 DVD player. I'm not saying it's that cynical, but, but gesture.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   What happened? Well, you, you, you, something very strange happened. You've, you're my
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.720]   murderer is getting closer to your office, Merlin, someone in the house. You're coming
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.000]   through the wrong mic. Yeah. I don't know what you have to be situation. Am I better
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.240]   now? Yeah, you're better now. I wonder if it's, I mean, it's called a gesture is probably
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.200]   a little bit cynical, but it certainly doesn't hurt when you, when you work with sales
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.320]   people, you learn something interesting about what they're, what their life and what their
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.160]   day is like. There's certain things that sales people need to be able to say. And in order
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.320]   to compete with somebody who is buying on price, you know, certainly it's not the first
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.040]   thing Apple's worrying about, but it must be nice that they can say, well, hey, you know,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.200]   sure, we got, we got products to start under $1,000. It's just that ours are ours work
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.280]   or what you know what I mean. You, you need something with a hook and that price gives
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.480]   them a way to say that. I want somebody pointed out in the chat room to it. It's probably true
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.040]   in many small businesses that the $1,000 price point triggers more of a purchase, you
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   know, approval process.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.520]   It's like the federal per diem. Like I work with a lot of clients who are like, that's
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   per diem. You sell it. It's $159 a night. You can stay wherever you want. Yeah, right.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.560]   Our PDM is about 38 cents. I think that motel six, you can get a room for 38 cents. But for
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.840]   hotels and stuff, that becomes like a de facto standard. I wonder if there's something similar
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.400]   like that's right. That's right. The hotel, the hotels probably set their prices based
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   on that, don't they? Oh, they do. The nation in Seattle, where I am happy to stay. Say,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.280]   hi, everybody, say hi to Ed at the Ace Hotel in Seattle. That's place ever. Don't take
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   123. That's mine. But it's fantastic. It's exactly how often do you go to Seattle that
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   you have a room there? Don't worry about the other part of my life. Oh, you don't need
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.600]   to know. But it's but it's exactly a dollar under the per diem. Probably not intentionally.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.640]   Not per diem. But you know what I mean? The federal limit. You have a family in the Pacific
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.160]   Northwest. You're not telling a family everywhere. There was a time when intercourse was very
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.600]   important. And I but I but responsibility is not but I like a clean hotel room and I
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.000]   like to have a place with a sink and a window and and and child walls and floors and a drain
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.240]   right in the middle of slopes downward. Ask for the Merlin man. Sounds like this sounds
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.840]   like six. Give me the get my room. So I'm going to repleach for for all three nice days.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.040]   NPD has come out with some data and I'm told that NPD's data is pretty reliable that they're
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:19.800]   a good company to go with. And apparently the iPad has not as I might have thought cannibalized
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.880]   notebook sales. I thought for sure. Well, you know, you get this instead of the, you know,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.920]   this is kind of Apple's netbook. Isn't it this net this iPad? In fact, there's a 17%
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:39.560]   decline in iPod sales and Mac sales are up 39%. I would bet that it cannibalizes theoretically
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.640]   cannibalizes sales largely in people who don't currently own a Mac computer device. So you
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.280]   got somebody who's been working up. You know what I mean? You somebody starts with the
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.240]   iPad, the classic path. This is the Mac mini, the new Mac mini maybe.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.680]   Because well, just I'm thinking like, you know, let's be honest, most of us dorks who
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.160]   bought this already have a Mac or more. You know, it's not like we're not going to buy
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.000]   a Mac now. It's, you know, we want to wallet in a suitcase, right? Right.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.960]   Right. Do they look at trends from last year in the year before? This is just this quarter.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:20.920]   US Mac sales climb 39% in April. April has been an always been an excellent month for Apple.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.840]   Yeah. But it's not it's not generally a good month for iPod sales, is it?
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.560]   Yeah, I'd like to see how they connect the dots on that because iPod sales have been
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.280]   declining for quite some time. Not the iPod touch has been doing well because it's it's
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   a small computer. But traditional iPods have been declining because everybody has one already
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.160]   and Apple hasn't released anything other than the touch that's revolutionary that people
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.440]   really want to go out and buy. So I'm not sure how they make that connection that, Oh,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.360]   look, the iPad exists. They may, sales are going down too. So NPD may not be. I haven't
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.120]   looked at the NPD report. It's it may be just, you know, the headline writers, which is often
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.360]   a problem, frankly, these days, you know, I'm going to have to start reading articles
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.800]   because every time I read the headline, it's it's wrong. Well, the self this the latest
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.080]   thing on the cell phone, the study, the longitudinal study on cell phones, which is
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.960]   basically completely inconclusive. Everywhere the headline is cell phones cause cancer,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.640]   you know, or, you know, I mean, it's it's really interesting if you get your news from
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.760]   headlines, which I think almost everybody does, because who has time, you're going to
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.880]   get the wrong picture of almost everything. So maybe it's maybe a maybe NPD didn't say
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.960]   that. Maybe that's just what the yeah, it's it's also a problem because off usually the
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.760]   headline isn't written by the same person. Yeah, that's right. Actual all in itself. So
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.200]   and their turn and it's, you know, they're trying to drive traffic. Yeah, they have to
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.320]   put cancer in the headline regardless of what it's about. I was watching CNN and they
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.880]   botched the story so badly. This was a couple of days ago. And then she pulls out an earpiece
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.000]   and says, Oh, yeah, to do is do this and you're safe, which of course, there's no no mention
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.800]   of this in the study at all. And in fact, everybody I've talked to said, well, actually
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.880]   the earpiece makes it worse because it conducts the RF right into your ear. And then like
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.440]   because I'm going to antenna and then she's just or wear a Bluetooth. That can what could
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.520]   be the problem there? There's no transmitter in that.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:20.880]   Freakin. You know, I mean, you know, I I hear this is kind of certain kind of NPR story
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.280]   where like you don't find out until the penultimate paragraph that's totally written from a press
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.760]   release. You start out, you got some kind of headline, you talk to a person, you talk
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.040]   a little bit, you talk to another person. I'm not just blaming, you know, NPR for this,
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.160]   but you notice this everywhere. You realize that with short resources in the newsroom,
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.800]   I'm guessing a lot of stuff is written from press releases. And let's be honest, it's
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.440]   written by people who are not PhDs. And now that the web traffic is so important, they're
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.360]   also writing headlines to drive clicks. So it's even more sensational, I think, than
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.000]   it used to be a hot though, a B test. Have we talked about this? No, a B test, their headlines.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.040]   Did you know that? No, I didn't know that to see who click which gets more clicks. Every
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.560]   headline is apparently I am told that every headline on Huffpo and there's a lot of headlines.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.840]   Wow. They basically have a lot of capital letters. Look at that. That's a headline.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:12.480]   It's like aging audience. The, what is that? J? May be testing after so many minutes.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   They pick the one that got more clicks. That's really interesting. Journalism. A good editor
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   knows in his gut what's going to get more clicks, I think. Anyway. So they're saying
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.560]   you get the cancer, you get the cancer from from from any kind of phone. This seems like
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.520]   a story. No, they're not saying that. Yeah, there's precisely what they're not saying.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.880]   Sorry, but I mean, this is one of those like, you know, how health became like a section
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.200]   of the paper in the 80s, clearly, we got an aging population and a lot of nervous people
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.120]   in fleece. And so you start having all these stories. This is an evergreen story. Is there
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.200]   anything out there? Is there really a longitudinal study that shows anything significant here?
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   No. Okay. This, there's a new study, a new study came out, which actually just came out
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.440]   and I haven't read it yet because everybody else was doing it from leaked versions of
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   it. And it was a study of people that asked them how much they use the phone like on the
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   phone. How much you use your phone? A lot. And, and, and based on 10 years ago, they
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.360]   asked them, this isn't even they asked them yesterday. They asked them 10 years ago, and
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   then they checked in 10 years later to see, well, are you dead? And they said, even after
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.120]   all of this and all of the error that that introduces, they said, you know, on people
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.480]   who use an awful lot, there might be a slight increase in, I think it was glioma, a certain
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.680]   kind of cancer. But these are tech people and there are people on phones and how do
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.920]   you control for the million other things that somebody who's around electronic equipment
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.200]   all day might be subjected to? That's just one data point of, of hundreds. It's, I, you
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.360]   know, it drives me crazy the way scientific stuff and people who don't understand statistics
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.720]   and science, then this stuff into my headline anyway, sorry, not to rant, but it's really
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.240]   frustrating because that's, that's kind of thing that's going to make a lot of people
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.560]   really anxious. And just to be dead honest, I mean, I think you always got to ask where
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.560]   the funding for this come from. There are so many studies out there where nobody mentions
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.800]   that it was an industry group. Well, this wasn't the cell phone companies that were
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   mentioned that came up with this. Well, but it could have been somebody, it could have
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.400]   been somebody who's building a reputation for writing that kind of article instead of university
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.960]   that gets a lot of funding. I don't know why, but you know, that's, that's the headline.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:26.680]   Now, here's, it's funny because same study and a report in nature, the headline is no
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   link found between mobile phones and cancer. So obviously it could go either way. It depends
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:40.360]   on nature versus nurture. Nature versus CNN. So I don't, you know, it's probably appropriate
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.680]   for us to mention this because a lot of our listeners probably are on cell phones quite
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.720]   a bit. And I certainly have no, I don't want to be a shill for the cell phone industry
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.560]   by any means. If there's danger, let's talk about it. But I get always I get calls every
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   time there's a story like this on the radio show, should I get rid of my cell phone? And
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.160]   then, and then, you know, they get bad information like, well, wear a Bluetooth headset, it'll
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   be better.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.880]   No, I just told my cell phone at arms length and I shout hello. Yeah, I just shout really
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.280]   and I turn on the speaker phone and I just shout like hell and then people hear me.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.960]   Yeah, what do you show thing where you talk to it like it's a piece of pizza and it's
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   like, I see people doing that now. I saw a guy walking through Costco yesterday talking
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.880]   on the phone like this. Yeah, well, that's a reality show douche thing. Why? Why do they
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.280]   do that? Because on reality, just because you want to see the sprint logo or whatever
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.040]   you go. Oh, challenge. This week's challenge is really hard. Tim, go really meet. So it's
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.280]   so because that's where the microphone is so you can see the logo.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:44.600]   What do they they don't put the logo on the tiniest time you've been trying to say?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   I was on a I was on a news on uni. You were basically the see the Apple logo or whatever.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   I saw I saw the trifecta. I was on Muni a few weeks ago and I saw the trifecta.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.120]   What's the truth? Well, it's a douche bag with the white headphones and his iPhone and
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:06.280]   he had the he had the speaker on me had the headphones on but he was doing the douche pizza
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   talk with the headphones on screaming into the phone not was standing the fact that the microphone
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.640]   is right here. That's the other one I like people talking to the microphone like that.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.680]   You know, it's like when Humphrey Bogart in the movies, he held a cigarette like this and
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.440]   the whole generation started smoking like that but he did it because he was embarrassed because
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.000]   you didn't want it. You didn't want in the movies you to see the wet lip marks on cigarettes.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.920]   Also, he was short and he was short and he really wasn't that good looking.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.200]   Many people small.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.840]   He cried at his own.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.160]   Cried at his own wedding though. I got a lot of Aloha for that.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.680]   Did he really?
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.040]   Lauren McCall he cried.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   He's a good he's a good human. You know what the problem is Leo? Can I say Leo report?
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.280]   The problem is that people don't understand the difference
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.040]   that between causality and what's the word I'm searching for.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   Is that false causality thing?
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.840]   Well, where you see a pattern and like there's lots of things where the lines happen to match up.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.160]   Correlation does not equal causality says.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.440]   Yeah, there's a pretty big here.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.840]   I mean he likes to do this a lot in my experience.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.080]   Who would that be?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.560]   Big hair.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.640]   And but no but I mean just because the lines match up doesn't mean if you're not controlling
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.360]   for other data. I mean sorry.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.080]   You know it's funny because my wife read what was it?
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.000]   That's why ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.920]   This school district does not serve from the good work hard working Monsanto Corporation
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.520]   who only fertilize those ball fields for free with those dioxins.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.440]   For free asking for no compensation.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.400]   The kid loved the fact that the grass was coming up in the school colors of brown,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.960]   purple, orange, yellow and blue.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.240]   They loved it. They could not get enough of it.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.640]   And if some of them died kids die.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.200]   Come on.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.920]   You want your kids to live forever?
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.320]   What am I saying?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.440]   Just a couple kids die and that means no more.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.840]   No more dioxins really.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.320]   All right moving on.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.720]   Get that wookie out of my face.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.320]   You know I feel bad because Merlin man pointed this out is there it's all business stories here.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.600]   It's business stories all the way down.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.400]   We'll do a few more Merlin and then we'll talk about things that really matter.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.520]   The change people's lives.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.960]   I'm just going to drink some salt for you guys.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.280]   Go ahead.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   If you belch.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.600]   It's coming out of his nose ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.280]   Let's talk a little bit more in just a bit but first I do want to mention my friends.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.680]   It's Citrix the folks that do the great go to meeting product improve your conference calls.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.600]   Who hasn't been on that long boring talk about the trifecta?
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.080]   You're on the conference call on the bus.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.160]   Playing you know farmville.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.640]   That's that's what happens.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.520]   People are bored.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.600]   Their conference calls are not they're not engaging.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.400]   They're unproductive.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.880]   That's where go to meeting can really be great.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.680]   Now if you've already got it installed you can literally while you're on the conference call
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.120]   say no look let me just show you how this works and send them out an invitation or just give
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.920]   them a meeting ID.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.360]   They don't even have to have anything installed.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.120]   You say go to go to meeting.com.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.000]   Here's a meeting ID.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   Adele install in literally 30 seconds later they're seeing your desktop.

[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.280]   May I offer an unpaid testimonial yes you'll be Merlin Mac I just use it for the first time
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   as a part of my business I do tell us something else with people and I do think yeah it's it's a
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.920]   good economic way to get into the Merlin business look me up yeah you don't have to leave yeah
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.160]   but no but it was it's it was an interesting app and the way they do it on a Mac is really really
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   interesting it's but but what was what I liked about it you mean interesting good or interesting
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.080]   weird it was interesting a little weird it wasn't what I expected but I thought it was
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.840]   because it captures your whole screen if you're on a two-screen setup it actually works really well
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.440]   oh interesting but I ended up doing a thing because you didn't have it you couldn't like
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.360]   have a window that they looked at I brought up photobooth to to to to show the big it because
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.960]   it's a it's a kind of a hack but it is a brilliant act I must be grabbing your VGA output or something
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.840]   I guess so yeah the reason I mentioned it what I liked and what my host really liked was I guess
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:03.000]   there's you got so many seats that are watching it and you get an attention metric where it shows
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.400]   you how many people were doing something else right at which part in the talk and they were able
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   to say to me hey I can tell this part of the talk went over really well because that's interesting
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   I don't know that yeah it's well when you do public speaking stuff metrics are really metrics
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.240]   apart from number of butts and seeds is hard so anyway I just thought that was kind of a neat
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.000]   feature I liked it and they were really nice in helping us set it up so they're good people
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.560]   I love them good company go you should just use the coupon code go to go to meeting.com/macbreak
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.320]   you could have saved money Merlin you give me those guys pay the freight I'm the all right yeah
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.800]   you're the talent there's also go to training now and go to and there's a seminar thing I can't
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   remember what the name of that is go to seminars go to seminar yeah I mean really they've done a
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.760]   nice job we thank you for their support of Macbreak Weekly Effect all the Citrix stuff all the
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.440]   Citrix products and the Citrix folks have been really great for a twit in general don't support
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:23:00.120]   Jason Calicana's that's all I ask it's not the same person so let's say don't even go to any movies
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.520]   that features that Gallifenakis that's how upset that's how much any any Greek name any Greek name
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.880]   I don't want to don't read Jason and the Argonauts too close right right in fact you know if you've
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:18.040]   named your kid Jason time to change you're kidding right you're kidding of course I'm kidding I'm kidding
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.480]   I'm kidding I'm a kidder apple may soon be the largest u.s company in terms of at least
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.280]   market stock market value I don't know if that matters at all but it's an interesting story in the
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:37.080]   sense that in 1997 apple just sucked you know pre right before Steve Jobs came back
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   they were they were I don't even know if they were on the list and now
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:50.120]   apple's the third largest company in terms of stock market value number one Exxon mobile
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.680]   and it's on the slide number two Microsoft and it's on the slide
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.320]   maybe by years and according to smart money apple will be the number one company
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:08.520]   is this capitalization no it's a stock market value yes the stock price based on number shares
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.880]   and times the value of the stock I think is how it works Michael Dell remember 97 I love this we
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.600]   got to remind Michael Dell in 1997 Michael Dell said to an audience of information technology
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:27.880]   managers I shut apple down and give the money back to the shareholders today Dell number 78 on the
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:34.120]   list no I mean you know just let's not punch that man down I mean at your portal he made he rolls a
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.760]   great burrito no and you know it's not his fault oh he's still working okay yeah he's still
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.800]   no he says that to Steve every single day as he's cleaning out his pool
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.200]   and I was Steve in 97 I was right I found another rat mr Steve
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:59.800]   now if this went home nice to give them good to meet for change so before we start taking too
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.560]   many shots with Dell is still sells more computers I'll feel more not a lot more
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.480]   remember Dell's in a much bigger more competitive market apple is number 42 in terms of sales Dell
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:20.040]   is number 38 in terms of sales on the other hand if you're talking margin Dell makes nine I'm sorry
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:27.160]   a nickel for every dollar five percent apple turns 29 cents of every sales dollar into profit
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.320]   there is there's your price differential right there and that's and that's to make a
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.720]   group or kind of point that's a selling on price type situation right their margins are thin
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.480]   but they've got economies of scale right I mean they're able they're selling this stuff is it that
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:46.520]   the is it that the fixed costs of the parts are so it's the it's the margin on PCs because it's so
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:51.240]   competitive remember apples the only company that makes apple computers again points to Steve Jobs
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.320]   who said let's close down the clones first thing he did in 98 how much how much of a PC the people buy
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.520]   is Windows in terms of like a pie graph what percentage of the cost is the Windows software
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.200]   what is it it's about you know if on on a I think on a netbook it's 20 or 30 dollars which means it's
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.960]   it's a huge percentage of the cost on a desktop it's maybe 50 dollars I can't remember the exact
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.640]   cost nobody's saying exactly but it's in that ballpark yeah margins on the sub 300 dollar netbooks
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.120]   are next to nothing it's mostly they're forgetting marketing share and getting logos in houses and
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.960]   on school desktops even Intel doesn't want it because they're atom processor doesn't make
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.640]   them much money well what's the exit strategy on that kind of a they wish they knew they went
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   they would like to exit right now if they could well I'm thinking of like new order this is a
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.480]   story about the span of like new order and and they they put out this record called Blue Monday in
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.680]   in 1982 and it was a 12 inch and this is apparently a slightly apocryphal story but
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.120]   it turned out they had this beautiful cover that actually had something like like it had
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.600]   it did spot colors instead of process so it had like you know I you know a thing about printing
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.880]   like it was incredibly costly to have like nine spot colors on this album cover and they lost
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.280]   money on what became the best selling 12 inch of all time oh my god you can so it basically became
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.640]   like drinking salt water and I'm just curious about like what look what does success look like
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.040]   if you've got those desktops and those logos what do you do next with that you got installed
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:22.360]   base you got like what is it well when somebody's gonna buy a desktop or a bigger computer okay
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.920]   maybe I don't know then they say oh I like I mean who's the number one selling netbook right now is
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.840]   it is it Dell HP is it a sous it might be a sous but there's is there any brand equity in that is
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.280]   or is there anything where something is a lot of it's just a simple fact that they like to make
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.160]   sure that they can dominate the ad space they can dominate the end caps at Best Buy
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.080]   it's a shell it's a shelf it's a got the absolute coke kind of thing like the battle between coke
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.640]   and PC it's not at this point it's impossible for either one to win now their game is to make
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.240]   sure that everyone else loses that they they don't lose worse than right than everybody else does
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.560]   well and I think also they've been forced into it it's not I mean the market has said to them this
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.360]   is what we want I guess you could not make them I mean that's what Apple's chosen to do right
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.120]   Apple's Apple is is looking at this saying we're not going to participate in that race to the bottom
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.080]   we're just going to hold prices 999s as low as it goes on an all laptops 600 bucks as low it goes
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   on a desktop and that's where we stay but they're but they're still but these companies still making
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.280]   money on 650 dollar and 700 dollar and 800 dollar and 800 dollar one so there exactly it's the
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.360]   netbooks with where they're taking a killing on that's that's their that's their Amazon Kindle
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.600]   of the product line you talk about 1997 and one thing that strikes me is interesting is if you had
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.320]   you know kind of gotten a viewport into the future certainly it would have been interesting to say
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.480]   wow Steve Jobs was it he's going to turn this around that's pretty crazy but you also have to
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.760]   think a little bit about how interesting it is how how many problems have become not necessarily
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   reversed but the problems that used to seem really natural for certain companies you thought
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.360]   these other companies are never going to have like now Apple's got a lot of the same problems
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   in some ways that somebody like a Microsoft's going to have like you know not in the same exact
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.600]   problems but for example do you remember how fragmented Chris Breen backed me up on this do you
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.840]   remember and Andy you remember how fragmented and crazy it was 95 96 where they had so many
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.720]   educational line there was the right remember there's the Vx debacle and there were I had a
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   I mean they have a Mac for Price Club they have a Mac for Sears they have a Mac for every
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   because they thought well we'll just sell them by where we sell them which made absolutely no
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.200]   sense and Steve came back and said it was totally confusing to consumers I have to imagine it was
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.840]   at least there were too many skews yeah one sales and the salespeople have like that's going to
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.040]   on some level I'm talking out of my butt a little bit but that's going to loot your brand to have
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.080]   that much stuff out there and so with Dell if you're selling on price I mean is there like if
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.320]   you're a nerd and you're like Andy you go oh there's just one Dell model that's really awesome but
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.880]   what percentage of people who buy Dell's like even like know what model they have do you think
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.160]   well I mean it is it is a completely different company sort of sort of marketing not only because
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.920]   they have so many different models and so many different companies but so many different outlets
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:12.520]   it's they oftentimes Windows notebooks are sold like mattresses where if you try to if you go to one
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:18.680]   store you say well okay they have the silly double diamond deluxe plushie firm super deluxe now I'll
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.000]   see what the and they according me a price of $850 for let's go to this other store and they don't have
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.240]   the silly super black double black diamond they have one that's exactly the same only they call it
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.480]   something else that makes it difficult to comparison shop that's the same thing that they do they have
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:36.760]   different skUs first for different excuse for for staples different for office max different for
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.960]   best buy where they are superficially exactly the exact same machine but you really can't say that
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.120]   this one is the exact same one as the others but one of the reasons they do that is to prevent
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.560]   is so that they can have variable pricing so you can't compare apples to apples apples so she do a
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.520]   google shopping search for a skew you're going to see a bunch of stuff for best buy that would not
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.880]   and there's going to be different enough in like a cnet or price grabber type great i look stuff
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.640]   up in consumer reports all the time and i'm always it's always interesting to see that you can't quite
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:12.040]   get that model you know they know and and i think that that's apples shows apples control of the
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.200]   of the supply chain and house how powerful that is for them it went exactly the opposite it works
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.480]   but that works for them because they can have a business they it's almost as if they can have
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   five different separate laptop divisions one that makes a lot of money selling to best buy
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.520]   one that makes a lot of money selling to staples that's why that they can really
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.920]   arrange their product lines that way that's also kind of similar to the way that apple was
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:38.040]   running their business back in the 90s where they had seph in in a sense they had separate
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.400]   and and individual companies within apple one who only cared about selling to education one who
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.040]   only cared about selling to high-end business stores when they cared only about selling through
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.880]   sears another major big box retailers and so that's why if two if these two guys butt heads one
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   wins out the other out the other you're going to have one version of the mac lc that's for people
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.200]   who know what they're talking about a one version of the mac lc that's absolutely identical in every
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.320]   way but it's called the centros 620 and it's only sold through sears so apples biggest one of
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.680]   what apple's big advantages in marketing is that they are despite their size one company that they
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.560]   there's one there's there's one ship headed in one direction for go to frill all right i guess
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   there's there's so many economies of scale to that remember that scene in objectified i'm sorry
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.320]   great great but there's a state of jackpot where johnny johnny i've holds up the unibody
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   and you see the extraordinary uh efficiency right of the the cast for that and it's like there's
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.280]   a kind of a scale to that on every level and every bit of it not to be you know so hegia graphic but
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.000]   that really that helps the brand on so many levels because they want you to understand exactly
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.120]   what you've got something to accept you and go what do you have a do you have an original or 3g or

[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   take a break smoke them if you got them guys uh in fact i know you have one maryllen
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.000]   i have no idea what you mean if you'd like to light up a nicker rogwin go ahead
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.120]   as long as he gives you permission but first my friend's it's time to tell you about the good
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:33.480]   folks at carbo night carbo night backup i do this on the radio show i say folks if you're listening to me
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:41.240]   and you haven't and you and you haven't uh backed up don't come crying to me if you lose your photos
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   of your baby pictures don't come crying to me if your financial documents go away because i've
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:52.360]   been telling you for years about carbo night carbo night uh is the kind of backup i recommend i
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:57.480]   quote peter krog who wrote the dam book digital asset management book he's a great photographer
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.600]   really smart guy he came up with uh uh what he calls three two one backup very simple and this
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.040]   really doesn't have any do with carbon but it's a good thing to keep in mind three two one you need
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.520]   three copies of your most vital data and for him he's a photographer it's pictures but it could be
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.160]   your financial documents your emails music whatever it is that you can't afford to lose if you're
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.800]   a business you know you know what it is so three copies of it that could be one on your computer
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.840]   the one you're using that could be a local backup two of those copies have to i love this this
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.000]   brilliant have to be on different media so don't make it all hard drive don't make it all dvd
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.160]   two different kinds of media and and finally the one is one of them's got to be off-site
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.120]   that's so important because you know people make backups maybe they even do three and two
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.120]   they've got you know an external hard drive and dvd backups and then there's a fire they lose
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.880]   it all or there's a flood or the hurricane or tornado and they lose it all thieves break in
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   they steal it that's gone so you got to get it off-site and the best way to do this i would
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.120]   add another one that if a backup is not automatic you you just won't do it enough
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:03.320]   you got to have it be just kind of happening without you having to think about it that's
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.440]   where carbon is so great you can download it right now mac or pc works great on max go to carbonite
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.280]   dot com use the offer code mac break you get 15 days you don't even need a credit card absolutely
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.840]   free install it and see how it works i do recommend you do it that way because it it is depending on
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.680]   how much data you have and it uses your broadband doesn't tie up your computer it's very they've
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.360]   put a lot of sophisticated technology in here to make sure that they don't get in your way
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.400]   but when you're not using your computer or your internet it's backing up always in the background
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.560]   always keeping you up to date try it free for two weeks if you like it you get two months free when
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:43.240]   you use the coupon code mac break carbonite c_a_r_b_o_n_ it dot com slash mac break
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:49.800]   uh just to ease your mind it uses a es 256 bit encryption you have the password not them so it's
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.960]   absolutely private even if you don't use the encryption option you don't have to it will use
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:59.800]   ssl so it's encrypted on the way to the carbonite servers the carbonite servers are i think they're
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.360]   just down the road from you a little bit actually and either in boston uh and they are in multiple
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:10.520]   network operation centers of course can you know backed up themselves so you really have this
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:17.640]   peace of mind that your data is safe carbonite dot com use the offer code mac break it's a great
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:24.200]   solution and i highly recommend it so let's see from verna hat sock oh yes so here's an
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:35.720]   an a_b_c_ story diane campbell this is huff poh apple store refuses to take cash for ipad woman says
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:42.280]   uh diane campbell walks into the apple store in palo alto steve jobs home store
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.600]   she says i had my cash in the backpack i went proudly up to the counter i told him i would
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.720]   like to purchase an ipad apparently i didn't know this apple sales policy says you must use a
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:58.840]   credit or debit card you cannot pay cash they turned her away sorry we don't take cash
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.280]   is this another brilliant steve jobs move or what
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.000]   no i think i think it's just to make sure that that doesn't that to prevent these things from
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.600]   running from the reseller channel without being able to track them so like if you had a thousands
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.080]   of dollars you could come in and bite five ipads and yeah i mean especially since they're rolling
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.800]   out the the international release so slowly is that legal though can can you refuse legal tender
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.000]   uh i believe the last time i looked into it was four or five years ago on a
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.080]   on a related matter and retailers are free to take or not take any currency or any form of payment
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.400]   they don't want so do they can no longer they that you can't force them to take cash anymore
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.600]   you can force them to take your diners club card interesting okay what about uh what about the
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:46.280]   thing legal tender or that's public and private isn't that is that not your main it says that right
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.680]   on the bill it's it's legal tender that doesn't mean that you necessarily have to take it
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.720]   you can right they have a sign over the counter no shirt no shoes no cash no credit card was it
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.440]   was it american money because that could have been the problem maybe i know oh you know why because
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.840]   they got a skunk world that would have been great no problem it got a skunk works to develop
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.120]   their own currency apple dollars and uh you have to get approval from the store uh to to spend it
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.680]   probably not my take up to eight weeks ooh i like it apple dollars you can't use the logo don't use
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.800]   the logo how long before steve jabs has his own currency no well i could definitely see the roll
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.880]   up because you've seen the redesign of the hundred dollar bill yeah so you could you just see him
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.520]   like have you see him with like that like on the big uh big display behind him like at a keynote
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.840]   saying it has some problems with it it has a blue stripe that distracts from the portrait it has
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:43.400]   colors that are never consistent depending on how you hold it well we decided to take our own look
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:52.120]   at it's a small white piece of paper with the word 100 on it boom that's it boom johnny i've
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   designed it we take one large piece of paper and cut it into 11 small pieces of paper and the other
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.360]   piece of paper actually that's the other advantage of this new set up of mine if i paid this wall
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:08.920]   white and like since i wear black anyway if i just like tilt myself like this and go our first step
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   was to ask people how to use honey and we found out that some of them spend with it some of them
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.680]   gift with it how is the modern paper not good enough for gifts we wanted to change this attitude
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:30.200]   immediately we started with the idea of the breath mint it's small perfect square slender
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:36.120]   and can be easily eaten oops all of our all of our tests indicate that people enjoy mints
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.720]   in japan this is used in a very specific context we don't we don't believe that we can we don't
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.040]   believe that we can sell a hundred dollar bill at a hundred dollar price point and still make money
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.080]   ah that's why hundred fifty hundred twenty dollars really yeah but the only trouble is you need a
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.600]   vga adapter to use it and you can't use cash to buy it i did get the uh i finally got the camera
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:03.560]   adapter and it does work with the headset that's really awesome that's really awesome i got it from
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.840]   my camera and it works like a champ man that thing works great it's a usb it gives you a usb port
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.920]   right and in fact if you plug in a usb headset we've i plugged in the logitech clear chat
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.800]   you can listen and speak and record any any discovered this i think yep even well i a lot
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.240]   people discovered what the hell oh my goodness are you excited
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:30.280]   okay sorry about five minutes because i was telling i'm going to tell you i've
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:38.120]   a flutter before you put a microphone on camera okay i got myself this is bigger yours is bigger
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.840]   than mine what's that what's your new toys edity do i that's a i wrote this another five minutes i'm
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.560]   sorry you're you're you're in the penalty box yes you won't have to play a man down now oh it's
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.560]   back break weekly with chris breen and andi and not go chris what's in the news this week i understand
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.120]   there's another one i'm just micro phone your is released uh with looped out in brianon
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.200]   all right everybody show us your microphones whip them out oh look at that when you get when
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.680]   you really come up close to the uh oh man if you're if you're like 16 pounds if you're still listening
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:12.280]   to the audio edition of mac break weekly give up no it's their canonical list of things that
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:18.040]   also has an npr mode oh it dies doesn't it you flip it to the switch just like this and it gives
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:24.120]   you more presence yes when you're talking about that elderly women one of only three in the Appalachians
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.080]   who still does her own laundry by beating it against her husband
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:36.280]   okay okay okay serious sweet water it works it works with uh yeah it works with uh bluetooth
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.160]   it works with the headsets and also works with some uh some keyboards it depends on the power
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.800]   requirements that's really only limitation it was as far as i could tell from a technical
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:51.080]   perspective it was a total accident a very happy accident uh but they have drivers on there they
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.120]   i mean that that's the thing is somebody put a driver in there well as far as as far as i can
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:00.520]   tell them i don't have i don't have this from the source yet uh but it looks like it's due to an
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:05.480]   overlap between the way that uh bluetooth drivers work and usb drivers work that it's
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.800]   it it seems like a nice little coincidence that the x the sort of external devices that are
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.200]   supported by bluetooth are also the only kind types of uh usb devices that are supported by the
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:19.480]   camera interesting interesting i mean it's it is it's a happy uh happy accident who knows it might
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.000]   be fixed i mean it's especially the idea of being able to just simply
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   tote your favorite little keyboard uh usb and use it that way mhm and i'm sure that that's gonna
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.640]   i'm i'm waiting for the first audio company to really exploit this and say you know what if we
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.720]   can get really good microphones like a yeti microphone or a hundred dollar usb microphone
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.960]   working let's have a really good multi-track recording app that supports full 44.1 i would
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.800]   love to see that yeah there's there's there's one there's like an eight-channel mixer app that
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.440]   some maybe christa's seen that i i saw it i wanted to try it but not for 40 bucks
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.920]   have you used it christy you know which one he's talking about i've seen a couple of mixer apps
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.960]   and i but there isn't the perfect one out there yet that is that's the full you know digital audio
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.680]   workstation which i think all of us are worth a touch-daw on this would be amazing yeah because
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.920]   now you're telling me the channels but surf it's large enough you can deal with instead of you
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.800]   know they have some reasonably powerful ones for the iphone but the surface is just so small and
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.880]   try to manipulate that and you have constantly switching screens to get things done having it
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.120]   on the ipad would be a huge thing so i'm sure any number of companies are working on it
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:32.360]   hmm should be interesting um did you was it able to drive the yeti because it what i tried it with
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:38.200]   the it was okay i tried it with it sure sm58 ensures usb interface and it said not enough power
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.160]   yeah i mean and yeti blue microphones is actually talking about this is sent out of press release
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.680]   saying by the way it works works with this and so they're playing it up i've tried it with i have
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.480]   several usb mics here and i've tried it with a handful of my a couple of headset mics work
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:00.200]   this mxl usb 009 doesn't work with it because it's power requirement some of these to make a
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.040]   list of what works and what does it okay to that point can i ask a support tech support question
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.560]   of course i am having a lot of trouble uh understanding um like i feel like it's kind of
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:18.360]   do for me to figure out what precisely will will um charge the ipad i'm frequently surprised by
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:24.680]   what will and won't work um like it's like it's so all the all the new laptops work well i heard
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:29.560]   from somebody who just got a new 13 inch macbook pro and it doesn't work oh um one part of my
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:36.600]   macbook works live as long as the ipad is asleep just about anything will charge it but really slowly
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:43.400]   but if you want it live um i have a last generation 17 inch macbook pro that does charge it but my
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:50.280]   older 15 inch macbook pro doesn't charge it so and if you use an old iphone charger that won't do it
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.520]   because it doesn't have the 10 watts this 10 watts the power the thing well whatever i want
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.120]   power i have a thousand sorry go ahead sorry i was gonna say i have a 2008 macbook pro and
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   a charge that's just fine just to have speed uh the 10 watt adapter will typically charge it up
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.600]   in about three hours i was charging it for my macbook pro uh the forward port not the back port
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.000]   like the the good powered one in about uh i think it was something like six or seven hours
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.280]   so that's it so so so so it's one of those why's the one near the power supplies it's it's got
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:23.480]   more power i noticed this too yeah because because internally the architecture of the of the macbooks
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:29.000]   they have essentially like two separate usb buses one bus is shared by the trackpad and the
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.480]   keyboard at ipad and all kinds of other stuff the other one is just a dedicated usb port that's the
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.200]   one that has the maximum power it's usually the one that's closer to you or closer to the front edge
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:43.320]   of the device so that's why sometimes it won't a device won't be powered from the back one or
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.320]   will be powered from the first one you more typically see the sort of problem when you try to plug in
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.200]   a u an external usb hard drive so you want to use you want to use the one that's closest to you or
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.880]   you just want to try and see which one will work usually it's the one that's closest to you
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:02.920]   try this right now in mind this is an old 17 inch pre-unit body 17 inch i also have a target
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.840]   targets travel notebook charger that works just fine with the with the i-pad not charging between
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:14.520]   between my my phi which is total voodoo to charge between the my phi the ipad the iphone and this is
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.080]   the ultimate first world problem but i i guess i really need to be a little more scientific my gut
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.840]   is has always been that if you want something to charge fast you get straight into power right
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.400]   using adapter that the comes with every ipad if i use if i use my what's that thing i've got it's
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.480]   like a little white curvy thing that's got lots of plugs in it the home octopus you know i'm talking
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:39.880]   about the thing that's so uh... it's the iporters quit power squid
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   no it's it's it's it's it's a little white trick that power is never heard i use the power
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.160]   squid i know what you're talking about but apparently it's not what uh... Merlin said don't you think
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.720]   that apple could have changed the look of the power adapter for the ipad because if you have
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:00.040]   small is a pulp well yeah but it looks just like the iphone and uh and the and the old ipad power
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.120]   adapter so i have the warranty i don't think i don't know what i don't know what this is coming
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:10.040]   from because my standard uh charger like like you usually put i i have a little bookcase next to my
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:15.480]   bed that charges overnight and for that i use just random iphone charger that i've had for two or
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.920]   three years and it works i i i i i i i i've been asleep right i think you don't have your your
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.800]   ipad's not up and running now it works when it's right i don't notice the difference if i
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.640]   plug mine into walk away i can't believe how many times i come back and it says not charging
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:34.360]   way after it's been sleeping i have i have i have anyone to share uh i like a lot for travel uh
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:38.680]   which is this bell actually you can buy these in like vending machines at airports it's a bell
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.960]   can something something uh but it's a transient voltage surge suppressor for those of you can't
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.160]   see it's not a great indoors for ladies and gentlemen this is just an honest recommendation
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.480]   yeah there's something something is great sounds like a slick plate ad but do do any of you guys
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.640]   have one of these have you have you reviewed these chris so for those of you can't see it's uh it's
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:03.560]   a three prong like turning adaptable three prong goes stick it in any jack jack and it's got it's
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:09.240]   basically a power strip it's got three three prongs on the front and then on the side it's got two
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:14.280]   usb's and this thing is super handy for like a hotel room that's being a little parsimonious
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   with the plugs this is so crazy helpful when you travel it's a little big
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:23.000]   i don't see it that's that's it's nice but i i use something i use something
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.960]   monster cable that's a that's sort of a folding power strip where you don't have that sort of the
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.880]   the three prongs or you know sticking out like that it's actually a little power strip with four
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:37.560]   outlets and two usb's it comes with like a one foot long stubby little cable but when you
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.040]   it's not when you don't have a plug into an outlet it actually wraps around the power strip and the
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.320]   plug actually plugs into one of its own what's called what's it called
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:50.760]   uh it's for monster cable i believe i don't have it handy it's a monster thing so you got it was
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:56.520]   you get the juke a little extra to get the uh gold uh digital connectors because gandy
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:03.240]   if you're gonna get $100 but it was very good the digital version only because if i want the
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.040]   quality electrons they're not going to come in through any old copper connectors that's right
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   they're gonna listen to the gold but i just i don't want the riffraff electrons powering my
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.400]   expensive electronics well you know if you buy the gold cd re-release of asia the remastered
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:23.000]   version that's on gold you can't even play on anything but monster as as it should be right and is
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:31.800]   that a j a steely dance album or as i a the progressive so that do you no i'm at the moment black cow
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:37.000]   and uh peg peg and it's probably outlets to go power strip outlets to go and then here's another
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.200]   one that tom was in our chat room and i think or uh actually is in the studio but he's also in the
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.520]   chat room i think that you recommended the in-case travel kit at some point andy and this is the
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:54.360]   combo charger that comes with it which has prongs and a uh a uh a uh car charger and a usb and
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.600]   apparently that works but and by the way merlin that mini surge protector with the usb charger
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:03.960]   you're talking about that's the bz 105 zero five zero dash tv i'm sorry lio i forgot the skew just
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.040]   so you know you know there's nothing makes you feel more like a nerd than sitting there with a
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   delayed flight trying to plug in a macbook and ipad and iphone and erich with solo yeah i just
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.000]   like the biggest dorky entire world i was wondering you're going you're going like this and i i need
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.960]   uh i need to uh i need to uh have you seen my stabler what i like what i like about having that
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.600]   that monster cable the the outlist to go is that not only is it useful but it's also a really good jerk
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.400]   detector and there are months or twice like in my i've had this like for two or three years they
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.480]   just recently came up with a version that has both the power outlets and usb but i've had this
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.840]   sort of thing for like for a few years now and twice in my travels through airports i have had
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:47.800]   to say to some but not not believe what i heard said what i'm telling you is that if you unplug if
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:53.160]   i unplug your notebook for exactly three seconds i can have an outlet and you can have another
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.920]   outlet that you can also charge your cell phone in but you're telling me that you do not want me
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:01.720]   to unplug your notebook for five seconds to make that switch that's right because i was your first
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.280]   tv and i know i know you're not i know you're not using an osmorn or a k-pro which means that
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.560]   you actually do have battery in there i will power for more than five minutes my beautiful altar
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:18.520]   yeah yeah i would i don't think i'd be very comfortable with that i'm worried about surges
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:24.040]   in my again i don't believe yours was made in soviet russia so probably is actually rather sturdy
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.960]   when you employ it anyway but you know that power outlets to go thing is that these are not
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.560]   very expensive they're around eleven or twelve dollars it looks like a buck
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:36.360]   i just i just i also i just love the way it works the the clever idea of like you can
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.880]   imagine the designer like coming up with this wall case a four outlet power strip is very very
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:45.000]   small so that works yeah but what if we were to make and you match them having the prototype
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.280]   without stubby little things you know what if we made this just like three quarters of an inch
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:54.280]   longer we could have it actually wrap around and plug into its own socket so there would be
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:59.000]   nothing sticking out would be nice smooth bar when you pack it i just i want to i want to give
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.720]   the guy like seven dollars for a beer at his or her discretion so this thing has to just basically
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.440]   two two other plugs basically it double they make one model they make a three outlet a four outlet and
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:14.520]   a three outlet and two usb rechargeers in it and and andy andy io uni apologies i am very very
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:19.880]   sorry io uni apology uh exclusive cord management to eliminate dangly power cords i this is where i
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:26.040]   was wrong 24 carat gold plated plug for maximum corrosion resistance
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:32.920]   monster does it again do we do we as geeks are we not allowed to buy from monster i can't remember
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   well no there was a dust up recently about their i didn't they should like a mini golf course that
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:44.360]   had the word monster in their name baby and i i'd heard about their high end digital you speak to
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:50.920]   i i just i just love these like civic-minded nerds where you find out that they like did a really
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:55.320]   routine like hey you're you're called this the monster cable car you know pizza that we really
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.240]   own monster cable they'll all up in arms they're gonna organize a boycott they're organized a
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:04.680]   peace mark they're gonna build a huge quilt out of used vhs tapes to protest but then you find oh but
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.560]   also you know you know that they are using factories in tailand that basically kill 80 million children
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:14.280]   per per year oh we don't care about that i just you know don't want them to sue monster mini golf
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.080]   fight exactly that's what i was talking about the u_s_b_ that's not what monster cable does not
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.640]   usb i'm sorry not usb it was a uh hdmi they're hd you hear about their hdmi cables did you read
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.280]   oh i mean ridiculous the prices well i mean it's digital guys there's there's zeros and there's
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.000]   ones and your works or does it right mono price dot com that's all i have to say
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.280]   however mono price does not make the outlets to go and if if you want that i'm gonna buy this
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.120]   because if this is great this is the for but i want the one with usb don't i'd andi
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.400]   no price what is that for the usb model is a little bit is a little bit bigger this one you'll be so
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:53.560]   surprised at how small it is thirteen dollars three outlets usb it disappears in your bag i
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.440]   sometimes i'll just like yeah i'll just have it in a pocket because it's just so tiny yeah good good
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.680]   yeah cool it's 12 bucks it's been i just bought three different chargers for my uh
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:08.920]   iPad i'm i'm ready now boy i got the i got the monster outlet to go i got the combo charger from
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:16.680]   in case i've got the belkin the bz-1003050-TVL there's an easy way at lax to find out if you
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:21.880]   pass the dish bag test uh which is which is when your flight is delayed do you walk up to an
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.600]   incredibly overpriced retail vending machine buy something and buy one of these out of there
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:32.840]   and then go have a large large drink every time i go to lax they mock me for my small manhood so i
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.640]   don't every time i go to lax i think i'm being a place that that has never been cleaned yeah
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:42.280]   yeah it does look like that it's kind of the grime of of decades it's not the lax of the brady
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:46.920]   bunch that i remember that is a weird ugly airport oh my god apparently uh i thought we're
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.400]   learning more a little bit about the uh iphone 4g you guys think it'll be out in june any uh
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:57.400]   any you got one yet i can i can i can i can save for certain that i do not have an iphone
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   oh all right okay we count on you an iphone hd any of those any of those uh looks like it'll
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.920]   have the a4 in it which is the process of the power of the ipad that's really good that he
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.240]   didn't say the iphone was spectacular it must be a different codename they're saying that in the
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:19.080]   chat already different skew that's the del skewed i have one right here and i found it in a local bar
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:23.720]   ah look at that it's got that square edge and yeah yeah well now it's got the old case on it but
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:29.800]   inside inside yeah inside here there's magic i like it i hope that's true that they put the a4 in there
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:35.640]   um i think that's good did you how how many of you will do a little lightning round although this
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:42.920]   one we could spend some time on apple make sure that it's you're free from porn the late night
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:50.840]   conversation thank you apple the late night conversation uh between uh gocker uh writer um
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:57.560]   it was his name tate right uh and steve jobs just blew me away he spent some time
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:03.720]   at about two in the morning steve jobs took took some time to set this guy straight
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.320]   and it's really kind of a remarkable conversation did you did you guys get a chance to uh to read
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.520]   this yeah i read i read the whole thing it was and it was not your typical like steve jobs
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.640]   required to believe it was even steve and yeah well because it was it was so chatty especially
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   after the guy identified himself as you know someone who would definitely blog about this and
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.680]   get a lot of would get a lot of hits off of it um do you think this is jobs trying to open apple
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:34.360]   up a little bit i mean he really has been emailing responses to people apparently i uh if i would
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:40.120]   guess it was just simply a response to an email that was that made it into his inbox and once he was
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:46.280]   sort of on this once once he was in the process of replying to this email that's what he was doing
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.960]   i don't think that there was i don't think that there was a larger message of well of course we
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:54.040]   have this we have instituted this new policy of being a little bit more open and talking informally
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.200]   through the blogs no this one i don't happen is in box and just like any one of us turns into a
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.120]   okay i know you're high on something i don't know whether it is an opiate phrase a how you
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:09.000]   cilid cinja perhaps or if this isn't just some dog which is really really lucky at using that
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.880]   predicted i love i love it when steve goes gosh first of all gosh why are you so bitter over a
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.320]   technical issue as such as this it's really interesting at the end of course jobs gives him
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:29.960]   the final parting blow which really if if it were me ryan's kind of a bigger man than i because he
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.080]   publishes this whole exchange at the end job says by the way what have you done that's so great
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.120]   do you create anything or just criticize others work and belittle their motivations
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:47.480]   ow i think i think this was two exchanges away from godwin i think oh yeah wow but i don't blame
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   that that was a it was great that he kept the conversation going of course he's going to publish
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.640]   this because he'd be an idiot if he did he had a nice long conversation two-hour conversation
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.600]   and and also also getting a lot of good quotes out of job so i i don't blame a one tiny bit
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.640]   i do i do i'm not i don't like the idea that the meme from this has become apple's apple tries to
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.360]   fear you free from pet from pornography you see they want to control you and everything you do
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.200]   ryan did that by the way ryan tate did that he said if there's one thing i'll take away it's that
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   apple free from port which was the first thing that job in the first message to job center well
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.960]   no because it wasn't it wasn't gonna free it was a long line of i'm where uh it was the the snarky
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.240]   original email was about well i mean you're you're not giving us freedom you're not giving it
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.320]   living us good you're not giving us freedom but by by taking out these technologies and not
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.080]   supporting flash i think and how would dylan feel about this you know i think was the first
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.440]   yeah exactly dylan was stuck on it yeah you really do have to use the hippie boys you know bob dylan
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.120]   stood for something man he stood for freedom revolution to keep me to know what has happened to apple
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.360]   since that poster came out man and then it says yeah freedom from programs is to this is jobs
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:56.280]   talking yeah yep he says we know it's jobs because he says yep yep freedom from programs is steal
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:02.200]   your private data freedom from programs that trash your battery freedom from porn yep freedom
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:07.720]   the times they are a change in and some traditional pc folks feel like their world is slipping away i
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.320]   think that's kind of interesting it is well that proves his jobs too because he actually knows that
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.840]   the times they are a changing quote because nobody else nobody knows it was actually dylan yeah give
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.040]   the anochis the cigarette yeah i do yeah exactly pull something from it's all over now baby blue but
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.920]   why pull that quote you know if you're really into dylan not much steve come on come on this is
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.720]   your criticism at least quote twitter in the monkey man i was like show that you got some wilbur
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:39.880]   his waiter in the monkey man that's that's very in the monkey man he woke up for cash
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:48.280]   that's very late dylan i do actually like that song i listened to that i'm over and over
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.520]   that just shows what i know thought there's no craft work so um anything else to say about
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.880]   that exchange that's that's it i think it's fascinating it's weird i think it's really really
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.360]   weird and i'm just guessing i don't know if it's like i don't know maybe i don't say medication i
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.440]   didn't mean to imply blah blah but like he's up late you know you're it was two twenty in the
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.760]   morning that final response well idiotically you can't sleep you get up you idiotically check
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.800]   your email and something in there gets your coat right steve is steve has more control than that i
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.720]   do not believe steve does anything impulsively do you
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:25.480]   uh i mean i i'm sorry no no you go ahead you know better i just because maybe he's just got away
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.600]   from him you know maybe maybe he stopped i don't know he maybe he seems so controlled so careful
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.680]   all i was all i was going to say is that usually when mistakes are made and i've made these mistakes
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:40.360]   too uh about why apple does things it's with this idea that they are a really to get that they are
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.240]   a brilliant really together company that always has a plan always does things according to plan and
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.400]   that their plans always work out exactly the way they wanted to when in truth they are
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   just like any company they do things sometimes off the top of their heads something things that
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.320]   seem like a good idea to them at the time and they're a bunch of human beings that you know
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.200]   sometimes they're not going off of a master business plan or a strategy for this quarter
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:08.520]   it's i really think that whoever this landed in his inbox once it once uh i've heard multiple
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.280]   stories about how uh how steve works and that once he's sort of on task or he decides that this is
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.920]   something he wants to do he's just into it so i really don't think that this was in any way
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:24.520]   uh a big plan thing i don't think that i think it's just as what looks like just someone gave you
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.560]   someone sent you just well just like well how do we begin the show with cal canis that he got
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:36.360]   your goat and you kind of keep talking i'm different i mean i gotta tell you i i have no control i
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.280]   i think i i would disagree with you to this extent i think you're right that this exchange was that
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.880]   way but i think at some point and it happened a few months ago steve did flip a switch because
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.040]   in the past steve might have wanted to have this kind of conversation and would not have had it
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.080]   he i mean look at look how tight tightly locked down apple has been up till about six months ago
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.520]   and there was a switch flipped at which at some point steve said i want to tell our story i you know
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:07.240]   i'm writing these two thousand words screeds about adobe or uh drm i'm responding to email i think
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.640]   steve decided and i think you know to his credit if you look at how facebook has responded to
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:17.240]   its criticism with a stone wall or very poor representation i think to steve's credit at some
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:22.120]   point he said i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna tell our story and it's going to be me that doesn't
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.760]   well if you're just company there's no way else that apple that's allowed to so he has to be the
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.720]   guy that comes out and says okay look i've been you know people have been keeping criticism on apple
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.800]   over you know calling them fascists and nazis and and everything else you can about the app store
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:43.720]   and how they lock down things and and apples always kept their own little box to put their stuff in
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.800]   so that isn't a big surprise and it may be that steve just finally got fed up with it and said okay
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.520]   look somebody needs to talk about this i can't have anybody else do it because i'll fire them if
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.560]   they do so i will and and i don't think that it was calculated that he he said well i'll just wait
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.720]   for the next email to come in to from a blogger and then i'll then i'll do it and that will be my
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.040]   message but i do think that after a while he felt like saying look i got to talk about this
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:12.360]   i i totally agree and i mean i can speak to an extremely specific example i mean first of all
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   think about i'm thinking of three companies uh that i've visited in the past um apple
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.640]   lucas film and pixar three companies that are very like when i say they're involved in their own
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.680]   story i that sounds like a tushy brand thing but it's true like everybody in the in those buildings
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.800]   especially pixar is extremely dedicated to doing something amazing whether they're like
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.480]   cleaning cleaning the blinds or you know changing the urinal mince or whatever they all
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.520]   want to be part of putting woody on the screen it's like a real thing and i think that the truth is
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:49.400]   as much as we try to first of all to your point uh Andy i agree completely um i think at a certain
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:56.520]   point that that story is real i mean the thing is steve you can like or not like what he does but
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.920]   like and you can like or not like his style but the thing is he really he he is kind of the
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.080]   axis around which everything turns and i'll just be for myself like yesterday i got a really nice
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.720]   email from a guy and i ended up turning it into a post for my site because it ended up being the
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.320]   pitch that i wanted somebody said something and i didn't even realize oh this is something i'd
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.960]   love to respond to in a positive way thankfully for me but i'm just gonna say like i consider myself
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.120]   somebody who's like i don't see my immune to criticism but like i'm not that super interested
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.760]   in criticism from people that i think don't get it but sometimes if somebody gets it really really
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:32.040]   really wrong and if you're somebody like steve who i'm guessing feels strongly in his heart that he's
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.240]   doing his version of the right thing you gotta imagine at some point he's like you know what i'm
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:42.600]   gonna shut this guy down and i mean where he's human you know don't you think there's got to be a
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   point where some days he's like i'm going to be here for so long and i'm like let's some jerk with
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.560]   this audience go like tell my story i i think it's incredibly human and and real and he's probably
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.840]   just sick of having other people out there keep guessing what he does why he does it do you think
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:04.760]   um i you know i'm gonna go along with that as part of the reaction to um i think when he was ill
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   and people were chasing him down and stalking him essentially to find out you know is steve getting
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.400]   a new liver what kind of illness has he got and i think at one point he turned to some reporter
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.920]   you know and talked to him directly and just said you know honestly this is personal you know can
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.800]   you just go away and and i do i kind of feel like he you know we've all put him as as his godlike
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.240]   creature in this automaton and he's he's a guy he's a very bright guy he's a very focused guy i
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.560]   agree with you he believes in the message he believes what he's doing is right but i think he feels
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.640]   like there's certainly a line and and maybe he feels at this point that people have crossed the line
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.680]   and just said look we really are trying to do something cool here and something good and in order
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.080]   for us to do it we believe this is the proper strategy to lock it down so we can make it as
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.440]   perfect as we possibly can i can't i can't share specifics of this anecdote but i will share
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:07.240]   enough of this anecdote to say that um he does take stuff personally and um he will address himself
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:16.040]   directly to people that he feels um have gotten it wrong and basically wronged him in a way that's
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.800]   unfair and he will address them directly i'm sorry to be so so so general about that because i don't
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   think i don't think i'm at liberty to share this story but but basically he is a guy like he will
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.680]   write to you and he will say wait a minute stop like yeah it's it's one thing for us to like tassel
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.280]   with each other about like who's got the better product or whatever but like you're you're not
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:39.160]   saying true things and like the way he does it it tends to be very heavy-handed which i think shows
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.280]   that he doesn't always have complete control over the subtlety that would get the message across
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.800]   best that's why he's not a pr guy but i think he wants the opportunity i'm guessing he wants the
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.920]   opportunity to go wait a minute you know say what you will about all this stuff about who i am and
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.840]   like i'm this monster robot guy who does all this stuff and certainly there are enough anecdotes
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.920]   about that to support that but um i just have to imagine at a certain point you're up in the middle
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.960]   i'm just thinking in context you're up in the middle of the night and you're like oh man this
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.520]   and i i could totally see him isn't this what we want though i mean isn't this what we're looking
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.400]   for which is authenticity uh somebody's not a pr-flack but the actual you know the guy tossing the
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.880]   talent truth is it interesting authenticity and consistency and i think you can criticize apple
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.440]   in a million different ways but they i don't i and i'm ready to be told that i'm wrong about
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.160]   this but my gut is they don't change their story that often they don't like sure he'll change his
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.000]   mind because i know he's gonna watch video on a little screen or whatever they change his story
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.480]   all the time wait a minute you know we will ever watch video on a small screen nobody ever
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.040]   want to read a book okay but no i see that i see that differently that didn't happen in the same
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.600]   month okay because the conditions changed that people were now interested in doing that
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.000]   sometimes they change pretty quick i mean yeah no like i say i'm prepared to be wrong on that
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.800]   and that might be disinformation that job says intentionally uh to take competitors off i mean
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.840]   look steves a good businessman too uh and he may be just you know was spreading disinformation when he
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:09.080]   says uh we'll never have an app store and then six months later introduces an app store uh that's
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.440]   disinformation there's a there's a story that i go back to a lot i think i mentioned this on a
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.800]   previous episode but i mean there are a lot of people out there that are constantly trying to
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.680]   refer back to the 1984 commercial and they're constantly calling this up as some kind of implicit
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:27.480]   uh accusation about how all the fish is stick apple does all these things oh how ironic that
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.840]   they made this commercial about blah blah blah and i'm just gonna catch you you go out and ask 25
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.600]   people who are younger than me who big brother is in that ad and they're all going to say Microsoft
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.200]   that's interesting because it was IBM i'm pretty sure it was absolutely IBM and the thing is but
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.600]   to your point Leo if they had decided in 1984 that IBM because it made a good commercial was
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.160]   either competitor was going to be born this is what makes apple different right is they they don't
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.000]   change the surely change their story but they changed it in accordance with reality a and b
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   what's going to work best for them there's a plan it's not just this chaotic thing where they're
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.120]   just throwing stuff at a wall to see what sticks i think this is an exception but i think in general
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.360]   um they respond to the market but they respond to the market in the way that suits them
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.600]   they're not chasing anybody they're running in a way that everybody's going to go oh gosh where
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.960]   are they going do you know what i mean and that's why it's me i just think that's funny because
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.200]   there's so many people who think that's Microsoft and it's like they were on great terms with
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:29.960]   Microsoft back then right in fact Microsoft if we go back to 1997 put 150 million dollars into apple
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:35.560]   and while that's chicken feed now was a significant investment for apple and it was a significant
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.160]   vote for apple was with steve jobs first return keynote he brought bill gates on the screen and said
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.040]   we're going to give you 150 million and we're going to and we promised to continue to develop
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.480]   Microsoft office for apple that's that's was a significant turning point yeah also but he also
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:55.160]   said and by the way we love internet explorer and i think that's how and that changed of course and
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.920]   that changed as well but he did and people were kind of booing him when he said internet explorer he
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.560]   says no hang on a second and he took the took the crowd to task for it he said this is really a great
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.880]   piece of software it's my favorite browser and so certainly there was a little swap there
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.200]   steve also said that when the uh ipod hi-fi came out that he sold all his stereo gear
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.520]   yeah i bet sorry did that
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:20.440]   because he knew he could just buy he was gonna buy better stuff and that's right the buy it was
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.480]   and it was it was for my soul he was gonna throw it away i bet he had a Macintosh stereo
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:31.560]   and he was worried about namespace pollution oh it was an mci and to sh yeah hey incidentally
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:38.040]   steve did make according to uh brand erance uh at the market watch dot com the worst
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:45.800]   stock market move in history it was a ten billion with a b dollar blunder this is an interesting
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:53.160]   story and i hadn't really thought about this back in 2003 when apple's stock price was terrible
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:02.360]   uh apple went to its executives and employees and said uh you know we can we'll swap your uh
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:10.280]   your underwater stock options for new stock options and uh and steve actually did this he
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.440]   canceled his options for a smaller number at a lower price now this was when apple was trading
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.760]   at seven dollars a share it is now well over two hundred fifty dollars those options
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:28.920]   that he traded in would have been worth ten point three billion dollars
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.960]   and uh Brett calls it the dumbest trade ever he's now in the so if you say he does everything right
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.440]   i mean not that he needs the money yeah but you know what it costs to build a vault like uncle
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:47.480]   school he's he's sat now it's full and then what what am i gonna do with it i tell you yeah i've
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:53.320]   been at bernson every single day of his life and he only has a jillion dollars instead of a
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.640]   quadr jillion dollars he has two and a half billion instead of thirteen billion yeah i bet it goes
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.960]   into his bouncy castle full of hundred dollar bills and just goes up and down till the sadness
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:07.800]   price and price and price hey it's easy for you to say but let me tell you after you have your first
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.520]   couple of billion that it makes a difference you know it really does it's that's the number of
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.480]   castles you can buy the number of islands you can own it's it makes a difference
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:26.920]   do you remember a few years ago when scott warren was going on about not going on but when he was
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.880]   like the conversation was is it going to hit a hundred i mean i know we talked we wasn't that
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.120]   long and got said it'll hit a hundred and we all went ha and then he said it'll hit two hundred
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.280]   and we all and it's at two fifty so there you go have you seen the page where it shows you
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:46.120]   yes what apple stuff costs if you bought the stock instead of the hardware yeah
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.840]   amazing the biggest one is the actually it's very close to the one i had a power book g3
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.600]   two fifty which cost almost over five thousand dollars at the time but if you would split that
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:03.000]   money into stock 330 grand if you bought if you bought so no i'm sorry i had a i had a
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.560]   wall street or a pizmo but this one was yeah if you bought a power book g3 two fifty
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.680]   on november 10th 1997 for fifty seven hundred dollars if you put that fifty seven hundred in
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.400]   the stock it would be worth three hundred and thirty thousand dollars today we're going to take a
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.440]   break and get your picks of the week gentlemen and i do mean gentlemen but before we do it should
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.440]   be prudent would be prudent to mention our friends at audible we like to do our audible pick
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:33.320]   this week every time at this hour um audible before we tell you the book we're going to recommend
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.200]   i would recommend you go to audible.com/macbreak if you go there you could sign up for audible
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.080]   sign up for that gold account that's a book a week i'm sorry book a month and your first one's
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.720]   free and you get to keep it and you can cancel anytime so it's essentially a free book but it's
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.760]   important it's an important choice it's not a choice you want to make lightly because if you're
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:56.280]   not an audiobook listener you might say well i don't know if i like audiobooks how would i know
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:03.160]   so this way you pick an audiobook you get a sense of whether you know you like audible
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.480]   and audiobooks now i happen to live on audiobooks from audible and i know Andy you do too
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.960]   we love audible you have a recommendation for us Andy something you listened to recently
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:19.560]   or yeah this one is i have to admit that i've let my audiobooks stack up a little bit because i've
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.400]   i've been choosing long ones and unfortunately reading paper books which is not something i'm
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.880]   supposed to be doing at least i'm reading the paper books on my agpad so right you know that's
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:34.440]   this sort of works out but my next the next one that's in my queue for listening is a book by
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.720]   historian who's written a series that most people are familiar with Kenneth Davis is the guy he
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.440]   writes the series don't know much about history oh yeah he has he has a really he's it's not there
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.120]   there are two different kinds of like popular history books like this they're the kinds are
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.320]   written by like trivia guys who says do you know that there was once a watermelon that was so big
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:58.520]   that a family of five lived in it for three days in the New York world's fair eating themselves out
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.920]   of it until they got to until the fourth of july festivities in which case they destroyed it with
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.840]   the first firework every it's like okay that's fine congratulations you were able to look things
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.600]   up on the end the encyclopedia uh he writes he writes really good narratives that not only just
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:18.360]   digest history down into uh more manageable chunks where you don't have to really spend five years
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.680]   reading about the civil war and he'll tell you about one incident that will give you a big picture
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.240]   about all kinds of things we're going on uh so he he I think this was his latest book it's called
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:34.520]   America's Hidden History uh which is just a collection of really wide areas of history where you may or
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.880]   may not be right uh about things thanks you forgot me you learn about the pilgrims but you don't know
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.520]   specific incidents about you know what you don't know about the the first settlers on the United
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:50.360]   States uh it you don't really know much about uh what the funding fathers were really into uh and
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.200]   you don't really know much about the battle what the what happened before the battle lexin and
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:00.520]   conquered uh so this is not a book that will give you an in-depth uh essay of anything but it is
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:05.880]   it will take it will take incidents from history that will really be illustrated in
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.440]   ways you can instantly relate to he has his facts straight which is also a very good thing for
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:16.440]   his story to do uh and in when you're dealing with audiobooks i open it up by saying that
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.840]   i've gotten a little bit behind because i've bought like i've downloaded like really big like 10
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.960]   hour 15 hour 20 hour audiobooks where you really get the entire story unless you have like two
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   hour commutes every single day sometimes it takes a little while to get through them uh these are
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:35.320]   this book is several chapters several chapters that are self-contained so that it's just enough for
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:40.360]   that do one chapter one of these stories from start to finish in that day or two and then if you
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.680]   don't get to to it for another three or four days that's fine because you'll be starting a brand new
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   story in the next section so uh that's my pick for this time did you know that queen ezabella
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.320]   compelled columbers to bring pigs to north america which caused all kinds of disease it's in the book
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.960]   america so the jersey shore was born hey america's in history untold tales of pilgrims

[01:20:54.200 --> 01:21:00.760]   hd tv where you can't just get the tv you have to change everything in your life to accommodate the
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.560]   tv so you have to get furniture for it and you have to get a new ab system a new speakers and new
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:11.400]   this and that so you can enjoy it properly well the problem with the ipad is it's not good in
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:16.760]   certain chairs i'm in this chair i'm sitting in right now not so good for that so i harkened back
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   to my 70s roots and i decided to purchase a bean bag chair because i can create this slouchy sort
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:31.240]   of environment that i can sit down in the perfect ipad position and so i got one and i have it here
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:38.040]   and it's enormous are you going to recommend a bean bag chair i'd like to recommend the sumo

[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:11.080]   it is and it's very flexible and you can mold it to anything and so you can use it as a tent
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:18.520]   if necessary christian you look at chubby he does this is great and it's warm you know so you can

[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.000]   exactly right so it gets rid of the cheetos scum um it can be molded into different
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.120]   positions so if you want my daughter can just flop down on it flat it's great for that but you

[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.040]   i'm sure that you're thinking of those old velvet bean bags of your youth and this is not that this

[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.000]   it's not that it wasn't well constructed but i think they throw an extra couple in there just
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.240]   in case you're from opening this and it's there's what you're going to get yeah so you can open

[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.800]   imagine you can or you can just go down to your local Costco and get 50 pounds of pinto beans
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.720]   if you want that original kind of feel and smell and just a word of warning the gigantor is only
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.960]   available in the united states because of the uh because of the encryption due to export restrictions
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.280]   you may and by the way we've killed the site all i can get is the top of the gigantic
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.040]   because all i say in the encryption uh lee you can't have that in can you can't have that in can
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.040]   no i can't even not available in canada all steve the typical american people are
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.880]   making these cars no hard american effectively okay i'm sorry yeah i think so wow i don't want
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.760]   to use it i was at the the paxis that big gaming expo and then the first east east coast show
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:17.480]   and sumo essentially gave them like four hundred of these of these bags and so the huge hallway at
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.880]   the top of the top level of the hein's expo center was just like you know those matthew
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:27.320]   matthew brady shots of just like hundreds and hundreds of civil war dead imagine that only like
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.120]   hundreds of these big bean bags each but like one or two gamers in them like just playing
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.800]   on playing on their nintendo ds is like just totally what is the least amount of muscle
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:43.000]   what of calories we can expand and just put all of our energy into into our thumbs on working on
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.280]   these kids and working on these screens i was filled with so much sumo bean bag envy at that day
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:54.600]   my friends that i just want to say if sumo lounge would like to furnish the twit cottage would you
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.560]   would you all all we have three audience members today would you love to be sitting in bean bag
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:05.000]   chairs right now instead of the office style seating that you're sitting in i am not i am not
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.400]   above easy to wipe off graft i i would julie has julie has like a she's sitting in a three thousand
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.680]   dollar barca lounge you're right now in fact julie there's a lever on the right there if you'd
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:20.280]   like to recline please be my gift and i i'd like to ask i'd like to answer your questions but i
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.360]   don't feel it so i can i can advise you until i myself in my office as i agree right for myself
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   well and i didn't realize critical and that would be hypocritical of us to even say until we have
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.160]   one of these decisions i care about it you know a journalist with lesser ethics might be willing
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.840]   to do that but not me not this guy okay yes guys actually i didn't realize but this is apparently a
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:47.400]   very uh competitive product category because they have a comparison chart on the sumo site
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.160]   love sack bean bags versus the sumo lounge yes see i i would not want to send anything called the love
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:28:00.680]   sack really a love sack that's that's two nineteen seventy one you know that's why oh oh oh in the love
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.280]   sack is a little old sack that we can i don't want anything that might smell like lotion after a
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.080]   little while i don't want anything like that i can just see mike arrington coming on saying did you
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:16.520]   pay for that bean bag did you let's say i can't read my bean bag i just want you to know i don't
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.160]   know about the rest of you whether you get the swag from the bean bag place but i pay full price
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:28.040]   for my bean bag yes and i will not accept any bean bags from uh from anybody but uh legit screw
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.880]   you i won't accept it either i will i've i've been given a good day hey maryland your camera
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.600]   stopped if you press play on the camera thing because if you want to see your shining face while
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.520]   you you give us your recommendation of the week i would love to get back up on this from me because
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.200]   i think he's got a different opinion i'm really interested while obviously i don't want to house
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.920]   your your pick if it's not related to this but before the show we were talking about uh you know
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:56.120]   it's frustrating with the ipad um and i guess probably eventually the iphone how you move documents
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.600]   around i think it's a real personally i think it's a real weak point it works yeah so you kind of
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.400]   have to rely on either things like drop box that you can get to through the web but even then you
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:12.200]   can't download it to your computer and uh if there was a bit of the new software where this was a bug
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.360]   it would be a problem um but there isn't so i don't know about that but the but the thing is it's
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.880]   frustrating and you want an easy way to get your stuff on here and there is a an interesting emerging
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:27.960]   class of uh apps that will let you do this and so essentially as everybody knows your every app has
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:33.480]   what is it called a sandbox right yes you have access to the documents or stuff for that thing
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.320]   and unless you're apple and you you know have an api thing going on you don't have access to others
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.960]   well this has got to be like next to one password this has got to be like like just such a giant
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:48.280]   hack this works at all but there are apps like i will say good reader the one that i'm going to
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:54.120]   feature in a second uh the other one i've had is called quick office uh Andy what's the one you like
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.120]   air sharing is that is that an anti yeah i've yeah i've got that i've got that one as well
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.040]   so i'm going to focus on good reader good reader is really interesting it's not that you put on
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:11.880]   your iphone and you basically go in and um the the initial setup the kind of first run is well
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:18.120]   here's the kinds of things that you can have access to um you can go in and enter your credentials for
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:25.480]   for example google documents uh drop box mobile me box.net any ftp site uh gmail
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:33.160]   there's probably others basically a wide range of of of uh web dev any kind of hosted stuff that's
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:39.880]   out there plus it's got a web browser that will let you for example paste in uh link to it dot zip
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.360]   dot zip or whatever the point is this does two things first of all it hopes you get to stuff that's
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.520]   out there so if you got google docs that you'd like to have on here or you've got stuff on your
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.840]   drop box that you'd like to have on here this gives you a little tunnel that shoots you out to wherever
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:57.080]   you want to go and then you basically click it it's a little bit janky to use but if i want to go to
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:01.400]   my drop box and say hey this is something i want to have on here all the time i grab it and put it on
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:07.720]   here i can grab uh music uh i haven't had luck with videos but mp3s will work but i'd like to just
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:12.520]   contract pdfs and stuff that i refer to a lot i got backups of all my presentations on here as pdfs
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:19.640]   and essentially you go and download it and it's it's on your ipad now even when it's not connected um
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:25.320]   how much is good reader um ten bucks five bucks i don't think it was too
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:29.640]   carly it was it was for a while the best-selling app on the store the second this thing and i think
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.120]   that's because people really see the need for something like this it's definitely uh an itch
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:38.200]   that people are trying trying to scratch and i've tried a couple of these and i'm super interested
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.120]   to hear and he's because i spent a little bit of of time with the one that he likes but this is the
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.360]   one i spent the most time with um 99 cents that no one and it's got a neat thing where like if you
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.680]   do the whole like um if i think of this come up with a pdf if you uh you know touch and hold
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.400]   it gives you the option of basically like how you want to open it up so like you know my slides
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:03.080]   are on here if i want to go out and like you know do a slideshow um and it's one of the reasons
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:08.520]   these things work is because the ipad does have this facility to send a document to another app
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:13.640]   that can read it yes that is correct that is correct well right now i've got i just noticed i've
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:19.320]   got probably six or seven apps that in iTunes will let me drop things in actually kind of
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:23.800]   clever i've got a script writing like a screenplay script writing app that will handle uh keltics or
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.400]   i don't know how to pronounce it keltics or seltics files so you can just drop drop them on over
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.520]   drag and drop them kind of cool but uh but with this i mean obviously the the big step in the
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:37.880]   future is going to be something like drop box or similar having automatic syncing where you don't
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:42.360]   worry about it like right now even something as cool as ever know to drop box there's a lot of
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:47.720]   kind of manual stuff you've got to do to get stuff onto there um i don't remember i'm sorry i don't
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.120]   have the price in front of me i don't remember this being incredibly costly it's it's it's 99 cents
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:59.560]   what that's what they say jeez louise sub-zor wow the cost differentials on this stuff 99 cents
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.160]   seems to be the price point though if you want to move some units anyway i've been satisfied with it
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:08.360]   i don't love love it but um i wanted to get uh a copy of the upcoming new episode of you look nice
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:12.920]   today and throw it on here and so uh threw an mp3 on here and i was able to go and listen to it
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:18.920]   that's pretty cool and uh but i'm very interested oh the other one is quick office um and like i
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.480]   think pretty much to compete with this kind of app you need to work with drop box and box on it and
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.560]   so on and so on and so on but it sounds like um and you don't want to hijack your actual pick but
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.200]   could you tell me the one you like and why because it would actually uh i like uh i like air sharing
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:37.320]   hd for uh chiefly because i don't think any of these apps are really mature yet i think it's
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.800]   going to take a few months before they really knock this uh but i think that it's i don't like
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:48.040]   good readers interface i think it's just plain stupid uh as they also uh air sharing h air sharing also
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.960]   has an iphone version of this app that is absolutely tops in class uh for the iphone so i'm pretty i'm
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.480]   very i'm very very confident that once they get the kinks worked out on uh on air sharing hd it will
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.240]   also be tops in class it's gonna support printing it doesn't do that yet uh it's gonna support uh
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.040]   it supports web dev and just like just about every other one of these apps that's a little bit
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.200]   woolly uh but again i really think that this is going to be something to revisit in the next two
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:20.520]   or three months the drop box app however uh it might even simply say that there is no need for any
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:24.600]   really you don't want to buy one of these apps what you really want to do is just get uh just
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.200]   get the free drop box app and get a paid account on drop box yes support drop box and maybe at
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.080]   time they're going to get better and better i mean right now it's just drop box this is video
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:41.800]   that's just streaming directly from my drop box uh just through the through the drop box app and it
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.000]   also does though does that cool trick where uh if you simply if i go into my documents folder here
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.120]   uh and i'm trying to find a compatible it will it will also do the thing where you're talking
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.320]   about where it has a built-in OS feature where uh one app can simply hand off a document to another
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:03.080]   so i can save a word document uh just locally off my onto my hard drive take this to the copy shop
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:08.440]   with me then read it read it uh right here uh through the drop box app and if i decide that
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.920]   i want to edit it just tap a button send that document to pages or to any other word compatible
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.280]   application and start editing it and then save it right back to where we're out layout
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.240]   layout point of order yes sir i would like to change my my pick of the week to drop box
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:29.480]   um i'm going to go at their sharing hd that's that wow that was great uh and also just to
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.840]   point out it's hands it's hands down the easiest way to get something i own them all by the way i
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.560]   have every one of them you know none of them are perfect yet one other one other feature i wanted
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.200]   i wanted to point out though in addition to like uh uh working through your drop box it will also
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.080]   let you uh it will also let you go with uh if you if there's something you want to actually keep on
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:54.200]   your ipad just hit the star button and that that file will be downloaded and saved locally onto your
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.040]   ipad storage so once again it is the easiest way to get documents from your desktop to your ipad or
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.080]   even sort of blur the lines between what your storage actually is i have a right i went for i
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.320]   instantly after being in drop-up use drop-box user for about a year and a half i instantly went from
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.480]   settling for the free to gigabyte storage is like nope i'm gonna give them 10 bucks a month now and
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.680]   i get the 20 gigs because i'm going to use drop box uh much more we do we do 50 but there is an
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.040]   issue with that because as soon as i sign in a drop box on any of my multi-ferrous computers
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:27.240]   it immediately downloads all the data and it's like 12 gigs of data i got 53 yeah um so i'm gonna
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.040]   i'm gonna say any that is great i just want to point out one thing just because it's an interesting
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.880]   pattern i think it's really interesting to look at the patterns for how people are hacking the
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.600]   get in get out stuff um the i should have mentioned also that most of these apps do have a sharing
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:44.120]   feature if you're on the same local wireless all-up what one password all-up all these different apps
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.680]   that's really cool the other thing one is things like zepdoliner which will now let you mail it
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.880]   there's all kinds of little tricks people are doing with this stuff to get around apple
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.440]   sandboxing that's pretty brilliant and uh it's clearly demand for this on the other hand i
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.160]   understand why apple didn't want to put a file system on here makes it so simple and people who
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.200]   don't want to think about this don't have to think about it well and they don't have to support that
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.280]   i mean supporting that at this point would just be a thistle don't you think anyway um good
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.800]   good stuff and if there's more of these i'd love to hear from other people but uh thanks Andy
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:19.240]   Andy your recommendation what is your pick uh my pick is a really quite hate to be back in
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:27.080]   an ipad mode now but a really really cool tool uh that was released for creating web apps for the
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.840]   ipad that look like native full screen slideshow information presentation apps if you go to uh
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:40.600]   this website padelicious.com p-a-d-i-l-i-c-i-o-u-s padelicious.com you will be able to download
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.440]   uh a set of services for the macos finder that will allow you to essentially take any collection
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:52.680]   of photos that you have uh and then simply turn this into a web app for the ipad i've got it right
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:38:00.360]   here and this is one of the demos that is available on the site and really it is as simple as just
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:06.440]   point you simply select a collection of photos you use itc to like an i-photo or aperture or any
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.520]   other app to simply add the captions and add the comments to it and it will simply build this
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.560]   really really nice uh present oops this really really nice interactive that's pretty cool and
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:20.840]   that's and that's through safari and that's through safari what it does is it will also automatically
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.720]   upload it to your i-disc or save it to a set of files you can then host on any file host you have
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.280]   i don't know if you can actually see this with the frame rate uh of here in the video but it's not
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:35.080]   just simply slideshow flick flick flick it's actually like motoring in and out very nicely
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:39.960]   all these text fields uh are all these text fields are scrollable if there's more text than
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:45.880]   to be shown in one thing it even uh see if you can you scroll up down uh it even has let's see if
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:52.040]   we can get this working it even has uh moving it even has like background audio that it can actually
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:39:00.840]   use so see so if you if you want to hear now you'd probably have something a little bit more soothing
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:06.440]   than bubbling water uh but there is there three or four different templates for different kinds of
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.080]   uh for different kinds of let's turn off the bubbling water off the bobble machine
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.520]   enough i wait about a machine um there are a bunch of different templates whether you want to do
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:20.440]   like a photo slideshow whether you want to do like more like an e-book sort of scrolling text
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.720]   sort of thing the only limitation is that it does have the final web app has to be hosted online it
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.080]   can't be something that you build and then encapsulate it then distribute uh for the ipad but it really
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.680]   is just it's one of those really magical demonstrations of what can be done with automator uh and services
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.560]   and apple script and other other plugins like that it's completely free the best and the best
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.720]   recommendation you can get for it is that it was developed by the almighty sal sell us a go in
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:52.280]   oh you're kidding apple apple's iron chef uh chef of scripting and automation oh that's me and if you
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.000]   need a better demonstration of how great those two core technologies are just imagine how difficult
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.440]   this would be like with any other o s and a other tool it is literally just from the finder select
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:08.120]   the pictures you want to be as part of the slideshow select a select uh images create ipad photo web
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:13.480]   app from from the services menu and then it simply works from there that you it brings up a
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.680]   window so you can set certain options like what typeface you want to use what layout you want
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.480]   to use but there's no hand coding of any kind it just simply builds it and deploys it this is
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.840]   this is sort of thing where if you're in like an educational environment and you just need to
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.880]   distribute uh uh content like that very very quickly and very very simply and make it look
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:37.000]   not like a website that's being opened from safari but a full screen full bore really muscular looking
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.080]   uh web app this is just one stop shopping and it's free really nice now unfortunately the
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.160]   ipel vga adapter for the ipad won't pick this up right it only picks up keynote
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:54.440]   uh does it make i believe it'll work for me no it works with multiple apps i don't believe it works
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:41:00.360]   with safari works with uh it works with uh ipod it works with the movies app i have to double check
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:04.360]   to make sure what it does but safari i don't believe it works uh but it's not it's not screen
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:08.200]   mirroring so it might if it only did then that this would really be a great solution for any
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:12.920]   presentation i mean just what a great way to do it yeah especially because i mean there's
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.720]   there's another interesting little uh workflow excuse me a little service in there that will
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.960]   automatically for one of the bains of people who want to do presentations from the ipad
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:27.160]   is that it will that uh keynote does not allow for the ipad does not allow you to install your own
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.880]   custom fonts uh so whatever fonts your you have built in for the ipad of the ones you have to
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:36.040]   use in your presentation but this is a service that will simply let you highlight selected text
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.160]   and keynote or or powerpoint wherever app you're using just simply highlight it and we automatically
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:45.960]   transmogrified into a bitmap graphic uh so that it will render out the text so that it will
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:51.480]   display properly on the ipad so padilicious.com is a not not to it's already two pretty good tools
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:55.400]   i think it's going to be one you want to keep an eye on if you're an ipad user yeah well done sell
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:03.560]   that's cool pad i-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.com that's that sounds the real deal he's so great we love
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.120]   sell he is so great and he's so he's so modest it's like yeah when i met him on the set that day
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.880]   the first time i did mac break i was just like oh you're that guy it's like meeting sanna
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.440]   that guy's amazing yeah it is like meeting sanna it is it really is it's like you've done so many
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:25.720]   nice things on my computer thank you yeah sanna meets sort of the greek is really how i think of it
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.320]   you know also also give give give give give give give a beat nik jaz guy too yeah where's a burei
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.880]   he's got a burei he's a hipster one one quick note before we leave it though this isn't
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:39.400]   official this isn't an official apple product this isn't an official apple side this is just
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.440]   something that sell because he is sell just do that this is too good an idea not to share it with people
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.760]   so this is what he built he whipped it up i bet it's running in you know automator apple script
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.120]   that's those are his languages of choice very quickly because we're really long again i will
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:02.040]   never do another one hour i uh mac break weekly show it's just it's no way to do it uh hey why why
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:06.120]   why make it sure when you got such great running out of electrons oh wait no we're not there's plenty
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.680]   of bits to go around cut out my part it'll be like five minutes how long has you looked nice today
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:18.040]   uh the next one uh is going to be about uh probably around 30 minutes i bet you guys go for four
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:23.640]   hours though for that 30 minutes right i don't know i'm blacked out by the end usually the last two
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.920]   hours you don't know anything i'm gonna very quickly mention our friend daniel jalcut and his
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:35.240]   great product mars edit he's at red sweat it's reddit with sweater software which is red dash

[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:14.760]   and that's really the big improvement i think in in 3.0 is uh is the one like if you're doing
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.400]   corporate blogging or you're doing anything i'm not gonna fall back on the like you know dollar
