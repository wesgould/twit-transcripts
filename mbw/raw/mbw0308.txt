[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.600]   because look who's here, Andy and Otko.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200]   And his friends Mel and Carl love that
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   picture.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Looks like an Annie Leibowitz, but it's probably a fake Annie Leibowitz.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Well, I think if it weren't Annie Leibowitz, they'd both be like
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.700]   80, 70 year old men naked and hugging and I don't think we thought.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700]   We don't know what's under that.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.200]   This is probably the best way to go with that picture.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   I love it.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   I love it.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   Annie is right for the Chicago Sun Times and of course is a regular Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.700]   Alex Lindsey is traveling once again, but good news, we've got a fill-in
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700]   that is just going to make it so much fun.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.000]   Mr. And this is why it's going to be silly.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500]   I was just being silly about being silly.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   This is really silly.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   Justin, Robert, Young.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   Hi.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.700]   I'm Robert, I'm the director of the NSFW show and really weird things.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   Weird things.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   The podcast.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.700]   That's it.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.900]   Me, Brian Brushwood and Andrew Maine talk about the week's worth of weird
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500]   news and it's a fun time.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   So anything that you have that you want to throw in that's weird for the Mac
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.700]   Break Weekly show, please do.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.900]   It's kind of, we're all in kind of this.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.500]   It's a holding period, right?
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.100]   Because the iPhone 5 presumably this fall and maybe, I don't know, maybe a
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.300]   seven inch iPad, there seems to be a lot of rumors, but there's nothing
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   that happens.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.100]   Apple, you know, I think they're off for the summer.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.700]   Well, or like it's one of those things where it's a good Disney world and
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.300]   they're just the high, the high, you know, panels are up and it's like building
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.700]   something soon, you know, be available this fall.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.500]   So I'm sure they're hard at work somewhere down in Cupertino.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   The elves are cobblin.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.900]   Meanwhile, you hear a jet ski revving like in the behind the partitioning.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.500]   Well, that's, and that's the funny thing about Apple.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Everybody, it doesn't say coming soon.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.700]   Like just makes a noise.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   I mean, what the hell is going on back there?
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.500]   Here's a dolphin and a jet ski.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.100]   With Apple, they don't even say coming soon.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.300]   They just, there's nothing here.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   There's play, pay no attention to anything.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300]   Overlong citizen.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.700]   Yeah, it's just, you know, the iPad 4s is the greatest thing that's ever
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   happened.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.100]   Keep buying it until we say otherwise.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.500]   That's where, by the way, we're talking about this on Twitter on Sunday and it
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.300]   seemed that Microsoft made a strategic error when it announced the next version
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.700]   of Windows Phone, Windows Phone 8.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.500]   And at the same time said any existing phones sold will not be upgraded.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   And oh, by the way, please buy these old phones.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.100]   It's like what kind of marketing that's just, I mean, Apple's got it right.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.300]   Don't say anything until it's ready, right?
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   Well, and then same thing with the tablet, with the, with the, with the new Microsoft.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.700]   Well, that I understand because Microsoft doesn't have anything to cannibalize.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.900]   And what they're hoping to do is please don't buy anything from Apple or Android
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.500]   stuff because we're going to have something soon.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.700]   It's going to be really amazing.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.300]   As soon as we let journalists touch it, they'll tell you it'll be really, really
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   amazing.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.500]   Meanwhile, they don't say anything.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.300]   But don't you kind of prefer the way that Microsoft handles things because
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.700]   well, isn't it good to least say, well, here's what we're working on.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   Here's where we're going so that at least you be looking to a market can prepare for it.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.100]   And also the market can react to it.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.100]   I mean, when you just drop things on people's heads immediately, well, don't
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.600]   really, I mean, you don't really know if people are going to understand what the
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.300]   thing is about.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.100]   It's good for us gives us something to talk about.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.700]   Otherwise, we're talking about speculation.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.100]   I think it's bad for the business though because you get don't you, I don't know.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.400]   It seems like Apple's got their business or for their business.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.100]   Good for our business, bad for their business.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.300]   Right.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.900]   Because I mean, it's hard to say the business ever.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.100]   It was right to say the, the Microsoft Microsoft, yeah, Microsoft, I was right to announce the
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.400]   service.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.200]   I'm saying the wind, but the Windows phone eight is exactly the opposite of Apple.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.500]   Does it?
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.700]   Right.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.100]   Pre-enouncing a product is not available.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.100]   And furthermore, saying that anything you buy between now and whenever it is available will not be upgraded.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.100]   I mean, it doesn't seem like they're very consumer focused.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.900]   I just don't get it.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.300]   Like, I agree.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.800]   It's right.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   Andy, it's right for us gives us something to talk about.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.700]   You know, I don't know.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.500]   Maybe they kind of have to bite the bullet there where they realize that this may be they have to
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   pre they have to pre announce Windows eight to get more developers support for it.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.400]   You know that the one of the first questions is going to be what about Windows seven phones and right.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:52.600]   It's not not dropping the bomb is a lot stupider and a lot more damaging than saying we are eager to support all of our existing devices and existing customers while still showing them the
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   wonderness of the future of the platform, which is when I was writing my reviews of a couple of different Android phones ship that ship with Android 4.0 and of course, Android 4.1 was just released.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:11.100]   Every time I was trying to get like a quote, sorry, are you committed to doing an update so that you will so that one day your existing consumers will be able to use 4.1 and you get the two paragraphs of
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.200]   forward looking statements and boilerplate.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:25.300]   We are honored we are thrilled with the with the with the support for Android 4.1 that Google has provided as our strategic limited partnership in the United States and it's like, okay, so you're saying that you're not you don't want to tell us to.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.600]   Yes.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.900]   So you're right.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.300]   And you know, I'm going to take it back.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:37.100]   I want to I think Microsoft's being unusually candid with consumers and giving them giving them the choice to make a choice which you know what I should commend them for.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:45.100]   I mean, even if even if it's possible to do it by accident, realize that a huge company with lots of divisions that aren't talking to each other quite as much as they should.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.900]   You'd be super.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.300]   I mean, I think I think everybody who's dealt with these large companies, their their times when you know you're talking to a vice president.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.700]   Sometimes when you know something that he seems to not know, right?
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:06.900]   There was there was one time I will mention was like four years ago when I know of course I'm I'm on the train for my meeting for my briefing having this having this this this briefing with this guy.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.700]   And I get this piece of news about how another division of the same company was doing a product.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.300]   I've assumed it was going to be also is this this thing you've just told me about doesn't work really, really well with blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.200]   You said what do you mean your other division said that you're also doing a desktop operating system with when did this happen?
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.300]   Yeah, I actually like had to take a device.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.500]   This is what I read and he's reading reading reading and he dropped his he dropped his guard for good.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   Like 11 seconds before he went back into.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   Well, we were part of a larger company. This is very that we was part of a larger vision and this interviews over.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   It's a measure.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.200]   That's a measure how well somebody's been media trained to get out of the suite, how they could deal with those moments when they get blindsided.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   Yeah, well, I mean, Microsoft thing, it seems like they're they're dealing with a lot of different.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.500]   They have a lot of different people to please, you know, like Apple pleases above and beyond above anything else.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   Consumers their relationship with consumers is the only thing that they care about and everything else kind of feeds.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   Yeah, but what I think Andy's saying, which is kind of a new way to contextualize it.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.300]   I hadn't thought of is that what Microsoft's done is better for consumers because at least a consumer can make an informed decision now.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   You buy a Windows phone seven and knowing that it's not going to be upgradable.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.900]   We don't know what the new anything about the new iPhone or for instance, I'll give you a really good example.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.100]   We're all speculating about the connector in the new iPhone.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   Yeah, and Apple's not saying, wouldn't it be very nice of Apple to say, hey, well, don't buy him with 30 pin stuff.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100]   Don't open for it.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.300]   And $400 to have that hard dock connected installed inside your your $30,000 car.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:46.900]   Yeah, that would be dealing with customers, you know, really honestly to their detriment because then people are going to stop buying 30 pin stuff, including the F4s.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.500]   So in a way, I think maybe all right, you know, you Andy, this is rare, but you have actually completely flipped me over.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:02.700]   I think you're right. Microsoft was very honest and forthright and said and told people, look, this is a great and you know, I think Lumi is a nice phone.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.700]   I don't I don't knock it.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.700]   But don't expect upgraded and by being honest, I think maybe okay, I'll give him some points.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:17.500]   But the other the other aspect of this is remember that there is such a thing as institutional personality that spreads beyond what anyone.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   Executive wants to do.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.100]   There is actually personality that's consistent to a company.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:31.700]   And remember that this is a company that has never had the entire destiny of a product in their hands before, even if they wanted to maintain a super top secret phone or tablet until they until the day of release.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.500]   It's always been Microsoft comes up with an idea.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.900]   They have to propose it to a bunch of hardware manufacturers.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.300]   The hardware manufacturers might talk about it might not.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   It's possible that a CEO gets bored during an interview and starts talking about this wonderful plan.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.900]   They never had the ability to keep the tight lid on something.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:52.300]   So I think that became institutionally part of their character to not worry about keeping something secret until the last minute.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:10:03.100]   Maybe a year from now, two years from now after they have launched their first completely in house product and they realize that, wait a minute, why are we letting people like say mean things to us about how they would let anybody type the keyboard.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.500]   We kind of invent we kind of invited that that hurt upon ourselves.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   What's we're just going to like have have our little retreats and in Sonoma work on our little project and then showed off in one big event.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.500]   Well, let's let's talk a little bit about what Apple is saying.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.900]   One thing they've done is they've released the third beta of iOS 6 to developers.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.500]   And I guess I'm guessing that we're pretty close to the ready to manufacture.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.100]   I mean, they talked about this fall and I presume that it is with new hardware.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.100]   But when you get to the third build three weeks after the previous build, sounds like we're getting pretty close.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.900]   Of course, nobody who has it will talk. So even if Andy, for instance, had it, he couldn't talk about it had iOS 6.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.500]   Right. Because you're the beta.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.700]   You're you're enjoying if you're a developer from talking.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.500]   I could. You have? I could. No people talk to me on Twitter.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   I asked today on Twitter people said that it was what they say that it was a huge an upgrade for them in terms of a lot of the bugs that they were seeing before specifically in terms of it flashing back to the Apple screen, but not actually restarting.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.100]   So that is not fixed? No, that is fixed. I mean, they're noticing.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:18.100]   I mean, they've only had it for two days, but the stuff that they noticed two days in on the previous builds are not a problem in this particular beta.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   But I mean, give them time. Let them kick it around a little bit.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.700]   So, of course, John, you know, people are leaking one according.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.500]   This is from Mac rumors, of course, which always has it.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:34.500]   Eric S. Levkarenne, one key addition new section of the settings app for maps, allows in users.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   I like this to change the volume of the navigation voice.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.900]   To set distances in miles or kamata's and set map labels to display either in the local language.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.500]   You're always in English and map label sizes to either normal or.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   I think that's going to be very it's going to be helpful for me and I'll get into this because my my pick is actually a GPS app.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   But I think it interacting with when you're listening to an audio book or music or something, having a variable volume for me personally will be a great change in my life.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   And I like the idea of using Siri to integrate to interact with the map.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:25.300]   It's like, I think these are the really cool things are going to separate the best super phones in the future because it's taken a while for every one of the major platforms to have now everything now everything has 4G now everything has cut copy and paste and super sophisticated things like that.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   Now it really is going to become a race of inches as we figure out which one has those little touches that make you feel as though this is the one that you want to keep backing.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   I mean, I'm still using the Galaxy 3 as my primary phone.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   I'm still using the my phone as for actual phone calls and texts.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.300]   But this is like where I'm getting like most of my navigation and most of my like in car audio book and stuff entertainment from.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   I like the idea that the default action seems to be when the navigation needs to make a notification.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   Not only does it automatically pause whatever's playing, but it actually has a way apparently of communicating to say, why don't you don't pick up exactly where you left off, pick up about one half second or one full second before we left off.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   So if I'm listening to an audio book, for instance, say, and then Gimli.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.300]   So picked up his sword and turn left on route one in 30 miles.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:24.300]   Picked up his sword. It's almost exactly as though an actual narrator got interrupted and couldn't just simply pick up mid syllable.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.300]   He had to start off what sentence was I reading at that time.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   And so that's what that's what it does in the new Android.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   Like it'll pause your content, save the directions and then reset it.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   It seems as though every time a system needs to say something.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   I don't know the details.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   I'm going from the experience I've had over the past two or three weeks with this.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   And it seems as though every time a system level alert has to happen, either saying, hey, you've got a new text message or, hey, turn left at the next at the next junction, whatever app I happen to be in does that sort of pause behavior.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   Yeah, no, that's been my experience in the S3 as well.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   And I, yeah, and I don't know who does that.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   If it's the app doing that, if it's the galaxy doing that, if it's Android doing that, I don't know, but it's good.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   If so, it's not, it's not like that on iOS 5.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.300]   You miss a, you miss a bit.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   No, it'll, like you'll hear, it'll be like they're talking over each other.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   So my GPS app will be like at Petaluma Boulevard.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   And then he slapped me on my rumpus.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.300]   Exactly.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   And it's, you don't want to miss when I was in the audiobook of rumpus slappers, which is one of my favorites.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:35.300]   You know, I actually know there's a great 20th anniversary audiobook of the first heir to the empire.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.300]   And it was just an amazing heir to the empire.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   What's that?
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   The Grand Admiral Thrawn.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   I have no idea what language even you're speaking.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   Star Wars.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   Oh, Star Wars.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   So there's a great, and it's all recreated.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.300]   It's one guy reading it, but it's kind of audio play style, and they have all the sound effects and everything.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300]   Is that an Audible book?
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   It is Audible.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   Save it for your pick, because we're going to have an Audible ad.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   That's a lot more about it.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   But it's not as cool when you're hearing Han Solo negotiate with Alan Clark.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Turn left on Mission Street.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   I don't know what level it's being done by the system.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   My favorite iPhone GPS app, navigation app, is MotionX's GPS Drive.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   And it actually, I think, lets you choose.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:21.300]   When there's a system interruption, do you want the audio to mute out, or do you want the audio to pause and then resume?
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   So it also has its own built-in iTunes player transport.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.300]   So you don't have to leave the app to get there.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   So I don't know whether it's better off to have simply a system level resource that controls it or whether it's simply...
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   It's better to have individual apps and let them come up with their own clever responses.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   Well, I think if it's an official Mac app, like the maps would be, then that has to be.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   They have to solve that problem.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   And that's part of them taking over that responsibility from, you know, a official third-party app, like what Google Maps was.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   Other new features in iOS 6, Roadwork, traffic accidents in the Maps app.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   That's great.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.300]   Roadwork, especially.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   I like that.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.300]   Answer and decline buttons for FaceTime calls have returned.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   iMessage on iPad is now accepting phone numbers as a valid contact info.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   Greater 3D flyover coverage in Maps.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   That's probably as they fly over cities they can add them.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   Glyphs.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.300]   You're going to have to explain what this means to me.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.300]   Glyphs, is this a Star Wars term Glyph?
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   Glyphs for bookmarks, reading list in history in Safari.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   Oh, is that like an icon?
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.300]   I really saw an icon.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   I believe it's when you, either the mini icon that is associated with the URL that's provided by the server.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   I think that's what it is.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   I was, I myself read about this on an openly publicly available website.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   And that's so-
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.300]   Yes, of course you did.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   No, no, no, I do take that seriously.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   Whenever there's a question about it's like, did I read about this on Mac Rumors or Apple Insider?
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   Or do you, you know, AW?
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   Then, okay, yes, then I can talk about the-
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.300]   It's just for people to understand.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   When you're on an NDA, which apparently NDA is, a non-disclosure agreement, if something is publicly known,
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   then you can talk about it.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   Because it's been busted already.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   And so this is stuff that's in the public domain in effect because it's been written about.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   Right.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.300]   I would never confirm or deny that I'd actually seen anything actually happening on any bill that I actually have.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.300]   No, would you be allowed to?
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   Exactly.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   I am, my strength is at the strength of 10 men because my honor is pure.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.300]   See, we should just have another Skype that's just an Andy Nacho puppet.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   And we could just switch to that and be like, "Ah, I think the glyphs!
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   Oh, shit's a pretty good idea!"
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   Oh, Andy Puppet!
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   Say hello to the nice folks, Andy.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.300]   Who's the nice folks, Andy?
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   Andy Puppet is not a good person.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   Just a bunch of people today.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Exactly.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.300]   All the iOS 6 features while Andy Nacho drinks a glass of water.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   iCloud.com email addresses are being rolled out.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   So I'm still a me.com.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   But now we will have iCloud.com as new mobile or replacements for the mobile me addresses,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   which is good.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   If you sign up for a new Apple ID or enable mail on your iCloud account, you'll automatically
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   be able to sign up for an @icloud.com email address instead of me.com.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.300]   The email address has just seemed like the one thing that they can never be comfortable
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.300]   with.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   You know, it's always...
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   His first name was Dot Mac.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.300]   Mac and then me.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   And then iCloud.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   And they always got to announce it like, "Finally, we're done with the Dot Macs!
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   In with the me!"
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.300]   So now I'm a mobile me user and Mac.com and me.com still work.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.300]   But can I be an iCloud?
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   Well, I should try it.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   See if I sense something to me@icloud.com.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   I hope they do better with this than they have in previous times.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   There's so many times I still do not...
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   I got to my Mac.com address like the day that it was actually announced.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   And ever since then, every time there's been a change, I still don't know.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   All these new logins would say, "In her ear mail address, it should be blah blah @mobileme.com."
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   And I have to sort of tense up saying, "Okay, if I type in blah blah @mac.com, are you going
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   to tell me that's not a valid address, even though technically it should?"
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   Oh, man.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   No, it is.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:17.860]   I think it genuinely is a problem, especially for what Dot Mac was and what mobile me was
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.820]   in terms of being a subscription service.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.180]   It just always seemed kind of weird that that was something that was jerked around as much
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   as it was.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.540]   Well, meanwhile, since it's being used as part of your Apple ID, or at least initially,
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.820]   it transferred your Apple ID.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.780]   It became really, really important for that to be also part of sort of a locked in address
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.260]   that you're never going to lose.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260]   So, and even today...
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.580]   No, it's just that there's that category of stuff where if someone asks me a simple question
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.660]   about how something works, I think I know the answer, but I won't answer them until I've
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.860]   done like another 45 minutes worth of research so that I know that no, there isn't some sort
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.420]   of a subtle thing that you haven't figured out yet about this.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.580]   It really is the way that you think it was.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.220]   So much of iCloud works exactly the way that it's supposed to work.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.060]   But still, when you have these leftovers from mobilemeandme.com, it's like, "Let me get
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.540]   back to you if you're Gurnblanched and at mobileme.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.340]   I don't think you can log in at me."
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.340]   Oh, God.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.340]   Let me hang on.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.820]   Oh, my geez.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.300]   I really feel like there's some things Apple does really well.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.780]   And then there's some things like cloud that Apple seems...
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.060]   I think they should just hire somebody who really knows, of course, Microsoft's having
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.060]   trouble with it too.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.060]   They have.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.060]   I think part of the problem...
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   They got prominent.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   For some reason, I think we're feeling this a lot more keenly in 2012 than in any previous
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.060]   year.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.100]   I tend to forget that Apple is a regular company staffed by mortals.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.100]   What?
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.100]   I'm serious.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.060]   It's like the fact that something doesn't work properly, that doesn't mean that either
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.220]   A, this is the end of Apple or B, that whoever is saying this doesn't work properly just
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.220]   hates Apple.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.220]   He's a hater.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.300]   Ignore the hater who says that this should be working this way instead of the other way.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.540]   iCloud is a huge, huge undertaking.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:05.940]   I would almost say it's as big as when they tried to transition from OS 9 to OS 10, where
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.500]   you kind of got the...
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.380]   It became clear pretty early on that they weren't going to turn this service on with
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.860]   one throw of one switch.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.140]   It's going to be about throwing multiple switches, then watching multiple transformers blow.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.340]   That's the only way to identify.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.500]   Okay, those are the transformers on the grid that were faulty.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.060]   Let's fix those, throw the switch again and see what happens.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.980]   Well, but they've had a lot of faulty transformers in this particular project.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.900]   Let's not forget the all hands where Steve Jobs brings the...
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.780]   And this was years ago where he brought the entire dot Mac team in and he said you should
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.780]   be a...
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.020]   He fired a lot of them and said you should be ashamed of yourselves.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.500]   You've let me down, you've let Apple down, you've let your co-workers down.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   This is crap.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.860]   I mean, that wasn't so long.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.860]   That wasn't so recently.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   So this is an ongoing thing, isn't it, Andy?
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.740]   Well, I think we're talking about two different things.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:22:00.100]   The problem with MobileMe and DotMac were a problem where cloud-based storage and cloud-based
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.140]   software was a moving target for five or six years.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.140]   It's only fairly recently that we started talking about.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.140]   The word "idisc" precedes the word cloud storage by a number of years.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.180]   So by the time someone could take an idea, a really great idea off the whiteboard and
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.940]   actually implement it, everybody who was shopping for that kind of a feature has already moved
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.420]   on to Dropbox and moved on to something by a smaller company who could be a lot more
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.660]   agile about how they implemented it.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.940]   And by the time they finally figured out, "No, here is the fundamental thing that we're
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.440]   going to be calling iCloud.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.940]   It is actually a basic service that we want every single piece of software to be able
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.700]   to access and support and it's going to be supported on the OS level as fundamentally
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.740]   as any other service, as fundamentally as printing is being served."
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.100]   Once you get down to that level, it's not something that you can just simply drag into
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.500]   the Finder as a plug in.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.260]   It really is an architectural feature.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:55.100]   And whenever you do something to the architecture, to the foundations of an operating system,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   it's just complicated as hell.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.180]   I as much as, actually probably some more strongly than anybody else, because I have
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.460]   a lot of friends who are developers who are really just getting kicked right in the pants
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.460]   by iCloud day in and day out.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.900]   I mean, solutions that they wish for solutions that would simply be difficult to implement.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.140]   They're being faced with solutions that seem impossible to implement.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.180]   And when they look to Apple for help, Apple is saying, "We would be very interested to
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.580]   know what happens when you try that.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.620]   You should go ahead and try that and tell us what happens."
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.820]   "Let us know how that worked out for you."
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.820]   "None less.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:32.260]   This isn't as bad as if Apple ever released an iPhone and the power button was actually
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.420]   recessed by two millimeters who actually could only turn it on and off with a pen."
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.580]   That's kind of an obvious mistake.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.940]   You could say, "Okay, whoever came up with that idea, there are a bunch of doofuses."
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:46.820]   Yeah, iCloud is more like they just have to, it's the hard boring of hardwoods and they
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.340]   have to understand it's going to take them a few years before they have everything wired
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.060]   up and everything working to everybody's satisfaction.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.340]   And before that happens, they're going to be parts that work great and parts that are
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.940]   leave people like, and parts that really just cause rivers of blood to flow through the hallways
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.620]   of every hotel in Cupertino.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.940]   Is there anybody who's got it, is doing it right, Andy or Justin?
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.100]   It feels like Google seems to be doing it.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.300]   You know, yesterday Microsoft announced the new office and that it's going to, "This really
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.460]   surprised me.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.660]   By default, Office on the desktop will save to SkyDrive, not to the local drive."
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.060]   So I've had that for a couple of weeks now and I've been using it, I'm trying to use
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.020]   it a couple of hours a day.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.020]   Microsoft is another good example.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.700]   Their Office 2013 tries to move as much into the cloud as possible or at least they try
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.260]   to make huge moves.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.260]   Exactly.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.220]   They're trying to make everything that you do to make your actual physical location, your
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.140]   actual physical device irrelevant.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.620]   It's so, they're so all in on this that if you are away from your home desk, from your
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.940]   office desktop and you're on any other machine that runs Windows 7 or Windows 8, you can
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:03.620]   log in Office 365 and it will stream the binary of Office 2013 to that desktop.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.540]   Meaning that not, it's not a web app.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.940]   You will actually have a working running version of it and you'll have to restart and re-
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:31.380]   that's a great thing.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.720]   how much tablets, they're making sure
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.340]   it's in the bottomline.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.240]   So trying to make sure it's completely relevant
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.680]   to this completely new face of computing we're featuring,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.280]   we're seeing in 2012, 2013.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.700]   And if anything, they're being a little less ambitious
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.360]   than you would hope on some fronts.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's a big deal that one of the things I love the most
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.780]   about 2013, I know this isn't Microsoft.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.300]   It goes for Windowsough.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.380]   It goes to be on the Mac and it's probably gonna be
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.780]   in the iPad and the iPhone so, I think it's your main.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.040]   - You see something that they've really, really
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.860]   taken lessons from Apple where just as though we've argued
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.580]   pro and con about how a lot of the iWork apps,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.060]   they have moved away from having you navigate
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.700]   to a physical location on your hard drive
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.060]   to open your documents to this app will manage your library.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.380]   You will not see a file picker.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.900]   You will see a collection of documents.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.220]   And now that's what Office does too.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.060]   It's designed so that you don't have to work,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.620]   you don't have to no longer have to train users
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.700]   to understand how to navigate the C drive.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.780]   It will understand that there are a bunch of documents
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.460]   in this project, some of them are on the cloud,
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.700]   some of them are locally posted,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.100]   some of them are on the local network
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.980]   and it fixes all of that for you.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.700]   And it's an exciting, it really is an exciting time
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.580]   to be an observer of technology.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.700]   I mean, I can only think of the early 80s
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.380]   when everybody's realized that command line stuff
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.620]   and tech space interfaces were no longer gonna fly.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.300]   We have to figure out how to build something
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.220]   that is relevant to the way that people want to compute
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.700]   in the late 80s and early 90s.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.540]   It took a while for Microsoft to figure out
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.700]   how to build Windows and make it work,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.420]   but they got there eventually
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.540]   and to the betterment of hundreds of millions
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.380]   of Windows users.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.140]   So similarly, all these companies, Apple included,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.220]   are trying to figure out how do we transition
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.500]   from a situation where we know that the user
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   is sitting behind a physical computer,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.340]   even if it's a notebook,
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.540]   we know that they're tied to,
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.300]   they had their online, excuse me,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.860]   their digital identity is tied to this one device.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.860]   Now we know that we don't know whether they're gonna be
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.020]   observing and interacting with this information
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.900]   through a desktop with a big screen,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.140]   a notebook with a low power processor,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.180]   a handheld with a tiny screen,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.380]   and we have to make sure that the services
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.580]   that we provide are agile and can project
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.700]   into any space that the user wants.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.220]   It's not a trivial thing and it's gonna be embarrassing
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.700]   for a bunch of these companies for the next two
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.100]   or three years, but like Microsoft with Windows,
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.660]   eventually they're all gonna get there.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.620]   - And I do think this is what, I think,
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.340]   this is what users want, right?
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.540]   - Well, there's a reason why this is a necessary growth point
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.540]   for Apple and it's kind of in the face
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.900]   of part of their mythos, which is it just works.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.100]   And that's why we feel this pain more acutely with Apple
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.540]   because we're not used to it.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.660]   We're not used to getting something that is this hype.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.780]   - And it just doesn't work.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.660]   - And it just, that was why Siri,
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.620]   Siri, especially in the early going, was amazing
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.060]   and it works. - When it works.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.540]   - And now I think it's a light year's different product
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.900]   that people kind of gave up on Siri
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.060]   through the first couple of months
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.300]   and haven't played around with it lately to me
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.460]   at least. - Try it again.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   You're saying try it again.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.860]   - The uptime has been light years better.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.460]   It used to be one out of four.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.820]   Things would just drop or not go.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.380]   Now it's one out of every 30.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.980]   That doesn't go.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.820]   - So they're getting better,
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.700]   but I still say that Apple, probably,
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.340]   this is one area where Apple has not got a great track record
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.420]   and you're right and it needs to because this is the future.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.260]   - I think it's getting better though.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.100]   - Like it or not.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.660]   And I would agree with you.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.820]   They're getting better.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.340]   - And it's going to be-- - But they're far from--
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.260]   - They're not the best.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.940]   - No, they're not.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.660]   Maybe Google is the best at this right now.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.140]   Am I with a Microsoft closed second?
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.380]   Who's the best at this?
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.100]   - Google has certainly has the greatest velocity.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.700]   I can't think of a company that's turned around
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.380]   so many really struggling mediocre products
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.540]   in the past two years.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   And this same--
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.940]   (laughing)
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.020]   - Yeah, and I know-- - Faint praise.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.020]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.620]   - I'm so totally serious.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.860]   It's like I've gone from having respect
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.100]   for what they were trying to accomplish with Android phones
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.860]   to last year acknowledging that perhaps some people
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.940]   for whom an iPhone is not the best solution.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.740]   My goodness, they have this one alternative known as Android
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.380]   to thinking, my goodness, this is a real Android 4.0
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.220]   - I see.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.060]   - Our great hand holds.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.380]   - I see you carrying that S3.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.220]   - I see it.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.340]   - And now we have this Nexus 7,
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.540]   which is a legitimately great seven inch tablet.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.700]   You don't even have to say,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.340]   well, because it's cheaper than the iPad,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.900]   so if you can't afford an iPad,
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.420]   this is a legitimately great little tablet.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.180]   And so, I mean, I can't,
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.700]   every company struggling these days--
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.900]   - Steve Jazones told me, this was 19,
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.700]   he was at Pixar, this was 1994 or somewhere around there,
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.820]   that Apple blew it.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.140]   Now, remember, this is after he'd been kicked out of Apple,
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.980]   that Apple blew it,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.180]   that they had a 10 year lead over Microsoft
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.980]   with the Macintosh.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.020]   And by sitting back on their haunches,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.820]   they let Microsoft catch up.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.620]   And he felt that by Windows 3.1,
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.100]   they had caught up that Apple had blown its lead.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.060]   And in some respects, I feel like,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.580]   this is what happened, that Apple let Google catch up.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.780]   - Yeah, I don't think Microsoft caught up
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.180]   in the mid 90s, but you're absolutely right.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.220]   And this is something that I keep trying
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.540]   to restrain myself, 'cause I think that,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.460]   I feel as though I'm hearing a lot
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.620]   of really defensive comments from my fellow,
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.500]   like, App Mac users and iPhone users and Apple fans,
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.300]   in that there's a group of people that have been laughing
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.780]   at the monkey, that at all the parts,
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.900]   oh look, he's there in the weapons depot
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.580]   behind the playing around behind the army barracks.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.420]   Like, oh look, he's playing with the barrel,
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.260]   the barrel that broken down gun.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.180]   Oh look, he accidentally managed to get the barrel
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.820]   on the hands, okay, oh shoot, he's shooting.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.820]   (laughing)
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.660]   - What?
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.420]   - Isn't it funny, he's now grabbed one of the bullets.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.460]   Oh no, but I'll never figure out how to load it.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.900]   Oh look, he figured out how to load it.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.260]   But he'll never figure out how to aim it.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.460]   Oh look, he figured out how to aim it.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.500]   Well, but they'll never figure out how to pull the trigger.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   They don't see that,
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.740]   it's, I mean, as this actually,
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.820]   this tails back nicely to what we've been saying earlier.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.940]   We, as Apple users, we're expected to see a product
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.220]   for the first time and it's finished
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.700]   and it's perfect and it's beautiful and it's a work of art.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.300]   They don't understand that that's unusual
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   for the entire industry.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.820]   Most companies are monkeys with a whole bunch
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.500]   of broken down parts in front of them.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.900]   And it takes them a while to figure out
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.180]   how to put those parts together.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.660]   But eventually they're a monkey with a loaded gun
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.540]   pointed at Apple or any other competitor.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.260]   And so it's time to stop laughing
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.780]   and time to figure out that, nope, they got here.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.180]   Windows, Windows has actually gotten here
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.180]   in terms of desktops.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.900]   Boy, that's an interesting metaphor, Andy.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.380]   Well, I think that Apple is the monkey
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.900]   with the loaded gun when it comes to the cloud.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.220]   You know, maybe, maybe you see this.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   She was on the other foot or the other.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.300]   They're putting that together.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.700]   Because that's, that's their monkey gun.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.660]   Right.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.900]   We're gonna take a break, Andy.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.740]   This is good.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.580]   I like that.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.420]   We have a show title.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.900]   Yeah, Monkey with a gun.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.820]   Andy and not goes here from the Chicago set times.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.500]   Justin Robert Young from Weird Things
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.260]   and that little thing you do called NSFW.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.820]   NSFW, by the way.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.660]   We gotta change the name.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.380]   'Cause I went to NSFW.com.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.220]   Don't.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.140]   Oh, good God.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.580]   Why, sir?
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.780]   It's NSFW.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.620]   NSFW show.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.020]   It's what we call it.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.940]   NSFW show.com.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.780]   It's called NSFW.com.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.700]   I didn't think anybody could ever put
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.300]   one of those in one of those.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.820]   It's pretty much that, Andy.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.700]   It's as bad as I've ever seen.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.420]   We do a rebald show, but not that rebald.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.380]   Oh, that was rebald.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.860]   So we're gonna, we gotta change the name.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.340]   'Cause that, that, that,
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.420]   take your paws off me.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.740]   You filthy ape.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.900]   Thank you, Sible.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.100]   We're gonna take a break when we come back.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.380]   I do have an X is seven.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   I just came in the mail.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.740]   Both the I as in mine just came.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.060]   We've gonna unbox that a little bit
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.500]   and take a look at it.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.740]   MG Seeker yesterday said,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.180]   now, and this is MG.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.460]   The Apple bigot, the guy who,
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.740]   the guy who loves Apple.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.100]   Suddenly, wow, like Andy is saying the same thing.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.980]   Catch up time.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.020]   We've also, we got lots more to talk about,
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.100]   including that Russian,
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.620]   who's running the server,
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.540]   that Apple just can't seem to shut down.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.940]   But first I wanna talk about the, literally,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.660]   the most horrendously useful program ever.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.060]   Every Mac should be included with this.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:31.780]   It's, it's text expander from Smile Software.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.460]   And the new text expander, version four,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.260]   is Fabu, Fabu.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.220]   (laughs)
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.060]   Do you use it?
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.060]   I have not, no.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.860]   So let me tell you,
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.180]   let me tell you the key to this thing.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.180]   I got it, I always have it.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.700]   I every put it on every Mac.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.740]   It sits in the Mac and it waits for you.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.100]   Let's see, I'll just show you.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.900]   I'll open a sticky here.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.980]   And I'll just show you as an example.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.740]   Come on, I mean, I guess I'm in full screen mode.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.220]   Stikies.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.020]   So I'll type something like,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.460]   let's make this really big.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.620]   Let's make this giant so you can all see
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.780]   what I'm typing here.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.940]   What it does is it expands your text.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.180]   Now, it can do it in a couple of different ways.
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:17.220]   You can have an abbreviation like SSHIP.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.820]   And it will just, the reason I use two Ss there
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.980]   because you never typed that normally.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.820]   It will just expand it.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.300]   I've set it up so it expands when I type tab.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.500]   And then it just automatically,
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.180]   well, apparently I was wrong.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.260]   That isn't a, I thought this was a...
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.540]   Man, fact being off.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:37.420]   Maybe I've changed what I have in my boilerplate here.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.900]   I have, these are all in my boilerplate.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.620]   No, it's not in this one.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.100]   It's just one S.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.700]   Let's do that again.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.940]   I used to do SSHIP.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.100]   Now I just type, let's do it again,
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.500]   SHIP and type tab.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.420]   And it puts in my shipping address.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.300]   And all of it, did you see how that happened?
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.380]   And even if you want, you can have it pause
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.820]   and fill in stuff.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.860]   This is, for me, a huge benefit.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.860]   People often are asking me,
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.460]   who does our great album art?
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.820]   I say, well, they're by the wonderful
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.740]   Nitro Zack and Snag, get the Joy of Tech comic,
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.900]   email them.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.460]   I can type in, these are all the abbreviations I have in there.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.940]   Now, the best is another cool thing.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.500]   These are in Dropbox.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.900]   So they're automatically copied over
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.380]   from every machine I have it in Dropbox.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.180]   That's one of the things text expander will do.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.020]   Text expander is so sweet.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.660]   - Dude, I'm, so how much?
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.420]   'Cause I actually wanna give you.
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.940]   - If you do, you do a lot of writing.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.060]   - I do it now, I do a ton of writing
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.780]   and also I do a lot of repetitive writing.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.180]   - Anybody who does email is often typing the same thing
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.020]   over and over and over.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.700]   - I've been using a Gmail, Google Labs,
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.340]   plug-in canned responses.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.100]   - But this does it cross the Mac everywhere.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.020]   - Yeah, cross the Mac.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.300]   - Everywhere you're typing text,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.740]   version four adds fill-in snippet options
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.180]   like drop-down choices.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.580]   So you could have home or office
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.420]   as my mailing address, optional sections.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.500]   There's a great demo video you can find out more
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.900]   if you go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.220]   Mac Sparky has done a little video here, David Sparks,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.140]   on the fill-in feature that's very cool.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.100]   If you've never used Text Expander before,
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.900]   see I have snippets because I've been using it for
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.580]   as long as it's been around.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.020]   But if you've never used Text Expander before,
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.300]   there's a new snippet creation assistant.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.940]   This is what you'll use where,
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.580]   you start it with snippets for entering
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.820]   repetitive information like email addresses, phone numbers.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.780]   You can even paste in graphics.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.180]   Anytime, you know, you can,
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.860]   I have my signature, my initials.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.940]   Anytime you send the same thing over and over again,
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.860]   Text Expander will save you a lot of money.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.300]   Now, version four just came out.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.740]   If you purchase after January 15th, it's free.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.220]   Otherwise, for registered users, $15 to upgrade.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   For new users, $35, smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.060]   They do not offer this through the Mac App Store
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.380]   because of the sandboxing requirements.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.140]   But if you have Text Expander 3 from the Mac App Store,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.220]   which is, I think, actually what I'm running here,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.340]   you can get the upgrade price from Smile
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.460]   when you download version four.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.140]   So go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.980]   Watch the video.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.820]   Take a look at this.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.700]   You'll save time and effort and keystrokes.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.220]   It is fantastic filling out forms.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.300]   It can fix your typos.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.780]   You know, I have from Adam Anxt,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.300]   I have a tidbits auto-correct
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.260]   that will automatically auto-correct all of these typos.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.300]   There are hundreds of entries in here.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.940]   And when I miss type something,
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.620]   it will automatically correct it.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.460]   I love this.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.900]   Text Expander, get it, use it.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.380]   If you've got a Mac, you must have it
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:40.020]   from smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.300]   You know, I don't even, shouldn't even have to do an ad for this.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.060]   This should be a Mac break pick every week, frankly.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.060]   I live on this thing.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.820]   Should I open this up?
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.540]   So you've had one for a while, Andy, on the Nexus 7?
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.380]   Yeah, I've had one for a couple of weeks.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.020]   So people who ordered, as I did,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.260]   the day they offered it on the Play Store
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.540]   are just now starting to get them.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.780]   It shipped-- let me see if I can.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.380]   This is a type box.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.220]   If you go to Play.google.com and try to order one,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.820]   it ships at a very Apple-like two to three weeks.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.100]   I think this is interesting because the high demand--
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.340]   You need to cut that.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.820]   I asked that a hell of a time at the--
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.620]   Really, did he?
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.620]   He doesn't have sharp fingernails like I do.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.380]   You're right.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:21.820]   This is--
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.340]   --towel on it.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.700]   This is some sort of special Kevlar vest.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.940]   Wow.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.660]   John's come with his big knife.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.700]   But, but Andy, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.180]   The real key to this, if this were $400 and $500,
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.020]   it would not be exciting.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.100]   It's $200.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.860]   That's why it's exciting.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.340]   No.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.260]   Well, OK.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.260]   That's-- they're two components to it.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.260]   Number one, yeah, it's exciting that's $200,
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.620]   but not just because people would love to have an iPad that
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.900]   costs $200.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.380]   The sort of people who were not excited by the iPad
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.180]   or people who were put off by the price
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.180]   and put off by the size of it.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:38:59.540]   Right.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.420]   I realized that this is a 500-- this is really almost
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.940]   identical to a laptop in the sense
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.060]   that it's a $500 device you have to carry around in a bag.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.620]   And it's super slim and it's super light.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.740]   And the battery lasts a super long time.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.740]   But it still has all those drawbacks to it.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.020]   Whereas this is well within the price range of an e-book reader.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.540]   I mean, $99 is not the cost of a black and white e-ink-based
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.060]   Kindle device.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.700]   The Kindle Fire, which really has to be, I think,
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.380]   be regarded as an e-reader with benefits
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.420]   as opposed to a tablet.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.220]   That costs $199.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.660]   This is a real damn tablet.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.540]   So just this morning, I was out to breakfast.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.620]   And I was actually reading my Mac Break Weekly research
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.420]   on this.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.740]   Fits in the front pocket of my 511 tactical pants, by the way.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.140]   Not even the back pocket, but the front pocket.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.940]   And so I'm using it.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.100]   And the waitress who's used to seeing me with technology
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.180]   asked me about it.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.580]   And I explained to her what it was.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.020]   And she played with it for a little bit.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.540]   So it's cooler than the iPhone, but it's better than the iPad
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.100]   because it's small.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.740]   And I paused for-- I didn't want to argue with her
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.300]   about what was good or bad about the iPad versus this.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.740]   But I'm like, this is an ordinary person who's not
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.140]   necessarily obsessed about technology.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.300]   And she got it.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.140]   And this had a more fundamental appeal to her than the iPad
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.300]   because it's smaller and it's more affordable.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.380]   That's a big deal.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.740]   I have for a long time--
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.500]   I had the 7-inch Galaxy Tab.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.340]   And I think I was the only person.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.300]   But because I'd hold it, it was said, you know,
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.420]   this is the right size.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.340]   Now, what was wrong about that was Honeycomb.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.540]   The Honeycomb operating system was terrible.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.540]   And this is an example of Google, kind of like the monkey,
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.300]   assembling the gun.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.860]   They've got the bullet in the chamber now.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.940]   This is pretty close.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.580]   And do you think this is why Apple is so widely rumored
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.700]   to be doing a 7-inch tablet?
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.060]   I'm not really sure.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.500]   I honestly believe-- and though this sounds naive,
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.220]   I think this is true--
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.660]   I don't think they would be even remotely interested
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.060]   in the 7-inch iPad.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.820]   I was going to say, when you believe
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.940]   that people have been correcting me about being wrong,
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.460]   about a device that doesn't exist--
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:12.820]   Doesn't exist.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.860]   When people said, it's not 7-inch tablets.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.300]   A 7.85-inch tablet.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.900]   I wonder if you'll have the guts to correct you.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.900]   You can say it.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   OK, whatever.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.780]   It'd be somewhere between--
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.300]   We probably should call it an 8-inch tablet.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.300]   Because it really--
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.700]   It'd be small--
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.020]   The smaller iPad, let's say.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.620]   I honestly think they would not do a smaller iPad
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.540]   unless they legitimately and on their own belief
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.980]   that they could make a great product out of it.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.100]   They wouldn't do it because they'd make something crummy,
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.540]   but only because another competitor--
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.340]   Let me interrupt here.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.500]   This is one thing that Android does do very well,
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.980]   because I have a Google account and other Android devices.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.900]   I can restore from my Google account of this tablet.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.500]   At this point, it's going to log in,
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   and it's going to download all the apps I have already
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.580]   purchased, all the settings, and so forth to it,
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.940]   which means that in a few minutes,
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.100]   it's going to really be ready to run.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.900]   Now, but that's something you can do with iOS, right?
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.780]   I guess you can.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.100]   Because I've got new iOS devices.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.540]   You're right.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.980]   You're from the cloud, it downloads the apps.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.620]   But boy, it sure takes a long time to do that.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.180]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that they've
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.660]   got a very, very good solution for this.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.220]   But I agree with Andy that I don't
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.020]   think that they would be doing an iPad Mini because they would
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.940]   fear that they would be losing money from these other things
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.460]   to quote, and it's cool because Andy's got the picture
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.860]   behind him to quote, "Spaceballs."
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.860]   They're doing it for an S load of money
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.660]   because they think they can make it.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.940]   You know, and I bet many-- and this is the difference.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.420]   I think that everything-- and I've
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.300]   had a little bit of hands-on time with the--
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   7, the 7.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   The 7.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.020]   And it's good.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:45.900]   It's very, very good.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.220]   I very much enjoyed my experience with it.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.700]   But at the same time, Google's not making money on this, right?
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.220]   Right.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.860]   Like, we don't know how much of a bath they're taking on it.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.140]   But it's either very close to breaking even,
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:58.980]   or they're losing.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.340]   You know?
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.020]   So I don't think that Apple does this
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.100]   if that's the same proposition because that hasn't
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.740]   been the way they've done it in the past.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.500]   But to be fair, there was a cost breakdown on the Kindle
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.620]   Fire when it first came out.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.260]   And the initial cost breakdown was close to--
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.820]   they're selling a close to cost, right?
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.700]   With about $10 profit for every $200 unit sold.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.060]   That has since been adjusted.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.340]   And now analysts believe that they're
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.140]   making about $30 to $40.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.140]   OK.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.140]   Which is respectable.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.660]   That ain't bad.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.780]   Which is OK.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.220]   I think that if Apple--
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.460]   I also agree with 100% there, they would not sell a miniature
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.580]   iPad at cost.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.740]   They would try to still make their 25% to 30% margin.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.380]   I think that if they're affected by these little smaller
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.820]   tablets, it's only because--
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.340]   it's a classic turnaround where they're letting Amazon and
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.180]   Google do their market research for them.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:49.260]   If people-- they've already sold millions of Kindle fires, I
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.380]   think that Google will do exceptionally well-selling
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:51.740]   these.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   And that will at least demonstrate to Apple that, OK,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.220]   there are people who really, really want a seven-inch,
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.500]   eight-inch form factor.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.740]   That means that we're leaving money on the table by not
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.700]   addressing those people who feel like they're being left
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.740]   up by the iPad.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.780]   So that's the only way I think that these smaller tablets
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.460]   would affect Apple.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.020]   And to your credit, Annie, you have always said that Apple does
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.620]   not do reactive.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.980]   Apple doesn't look at the competition as--
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.780]   it's funny because they're one of the few companies in
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.340]   Silicon Valley that doesn't go, what's Facebook doing?
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.300]   What's Google doing?
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.140]   And so I don't think-- I think you're right.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.340]   I don't think they're looking at Google and saying, well,
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   they're doing a seven-inch tablet.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.060]   We better.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.980]   Or when they have had those inclinations, they have been
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.780]   their failures.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.220]   And I think Ping was one of them.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.780]   Ping was, how do we bake social into a thing?
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.060]   So maybe they did do that with Ping.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.780]   You know, the one thing I would say about the iPad, many
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:47.700]   rumors, is I completely lost my train of thought.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.020]   I was going to say something really interesting.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.580]   Say nothing, then.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.700]   Yeah, then it's evaporated.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.820]   I thought it might be one thing I would say.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.500]   If anybody's standard law enough, I can come up with it.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.580]   And sometimes it comes to you.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.420]   And then sometimes it just looks like a moron.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.020]   Not that you look like a moron.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.780]   No, I wore a jacket.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.340]   Try to master that facial expression that says, oh, I
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.620]   just forgot I'm under India.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.700]   I'm something I can't talk about.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.660]   Oh, see, that's--
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.460]   I better look like I lost my train of thought.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.740]   I've only been in the Bay Area for like a month and a half.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.060]   But now I just need to start inventing NDA's.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.220]   It's all about the NDA, baby.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:17.700]   I talked about this.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.340]   I didn't already know things I can't talk about.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.140]   I can't talk about it.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.620]   This is-- you know, I have played--
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.620]   I played with this a little bit.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.820]   I had isotope comics, and he had--
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.340]   I thought he had a Nexus 7 on the comicsology.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.140]   I saw the Apple logo on it.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.580]   I had played with this a little bit before.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.820]   And even did we did a quickie review.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.100]   But now that I'm getting to look at it a little bit more,
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.740]   good screen.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.340]   It's a little dim, but it's a very crisp screen.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.500]   I'd say technology as an SEI pad.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.700]   I mean, even 20 DPI.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.220]   Right.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.260]   You're under 20 is good.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.860]   Really, the only thing in terms of all the emotions
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.380]   of the graphics and everything, which is always
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:58.180]   where I've noticed Android has kind of lagged more than iOS.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.420]   It's completely caught up except for Pinch and Zoom, I found.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.220]   Yeah, I should be able-- oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:03.580]   I did.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.940]   Pinch and Zoom was still just-- had a little bit of--
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:06.940]   Did you feel that lag, though?
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.420]   Yeah, I thought it wasn't doing it because--
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:09.940]   I did this.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.940]   And it took a while.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.540]   It's much, much better.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.060]   Well, it's a Tegra 3 processor quad core,
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.420]   as you really get in a device like that.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.940]   Also, they actually made a big point
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.820]   during the developer conference about talking about--
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.100]   one of the features of Android 4.1
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.980]   was to re-engineer the touch interface
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.300]   so that to get rid of that kind of a lag.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.540]   I think that they've mostly eliminated it.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.340]   I don't think they've completely eliminated it.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.660]   At this point, what I noticed more
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.340]   isn't so much that it lags behind so much as--
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.820]   this is like a planet with slightly larger mass
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.220]   than planet Earth, where the gravity is just
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.540]   a little bit different.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.660]   Because when I want to flick and scroll things,
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.060]   I expect a certain speed and a certain physics
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.580]   that doesn't match here.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.100]   So I find that it's 97% as it is, though.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.580]   It's what you're used to, though.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.020]   I know what you're laughing at, by the way, Justin.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.700]   You're laughing at my music.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.860]   No, listen, you were laughing at the fact--
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.340]   You were at the Club Bangers, Lee.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.340]   We've always done that about you.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.340]   Fitting, Def Jam, Little Jet Life, to Mtyga.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.140]   OK, I totally remember what I was going to say.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.220]   So if we flashback to when the iPad--
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.340]   It's the 50 cent, isn't it?
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.740]   Yeah, I brought it all back.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.220]   50 jacks my memory.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:19.740]   Yeah, baby.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.180]   It's going to see normally does.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.740]   When we flashback to when the iPad was announced,
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:28.540]   and the buzzword was, it's a gray area.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.740]   And critics of the idea of the concept
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.820]   before it got in people's hands was that we have an iPhone,
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.140]   we have a laptop, why do we need this gray area device?
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.100]   And to think now that we are in a very short amount of time
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.540]   in a place where we're all kind of in agreement
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.140]   that a seven inch tablet to live between your smartphone
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.700]   and your iPad is not a crazy idea that people could want
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.420]   to own, especially at a $200 price point,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.540]   to have three kind of touch interface computers is amazing.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.540]   It just really shows how far we've come as consumers
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.340]   psychologically in thinking about how much we rely
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.180]   on these devices.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.260]   Well, because we have so much data now that we rely on that,
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.380]   when we have different ways of articulating that data,
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.180]   it's not about the device, it's about the contents,
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.900]   about the photos, it's about the books we rely on,
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.860]   it's about the music.
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.900]   And when you have a different and a unique way to express that
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.340]   and use them in our daily lives, that's a big deal.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.300]   I also agree with you that it's hard to think of someone
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.340]   who would not would necessarily not want a seven inch tablet,
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.260]   not that everyone should have one,
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.420]   but even someone who already has an iPad,
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.060]   I can see someone saying that, yes,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.340]   but it's nice to have like a more portable version of the iPad
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.940]   so that I can something more practical for reading
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.740]   that's more comfortable to hold on to.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.700]   I travel with the iPad instead of with my MacBook.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.860]   If it's a heavy work week,
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.820]   I will actually take my iPad three and my iPad two
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.100]   and have the luscious like two screen display.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.380]   This would work even better for that
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.900]   'cause now I have like an even,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.060]   if I didn't already have a second iPad,
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.860]   it would be, well, here's a $200 device
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.220]   that can do really things that the iPad can't do
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.340]   because of its size.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.580]   And I can still have like that second side in the hotel room,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.260]   that second screen that's showing me Netflix or my sling box
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.180]   or my YouTube content while I'm actually doing work
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.740]   on my primary window on the iPad.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.300]   - And now here's the thing, this is 16.9.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.740]   This is movie widescreen.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.820]   And we don't know, but the rumor is that the Apple
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.700]   will be 1024 by 768, it'll be four by three
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.980]   like the other iPad, which is a better choice
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.880]   for a device this size, long and tall and thin or square.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.260]   You know what, I absolutely admit that I was wrong.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.700]   When we were talking earlier like last year
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.140]   about the idea of, I'm sorry, months ago,
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.100]   the first idea of a 16 by nine, excuse me,
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.620]   a longer than, longer and skinny or iPhone came out,
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.260]   I thought, oh man, that seems so awkward,
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.700]   that seems so weird.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.020]   I think that it's really more like,
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.180]   it's more like I wasn't used to that form factor
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.460]   and it was really difficult for me to just imagine,
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.420]   like see the movies being displayed that way.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.900]   Or even not, I mean, for movies, it's great.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.740]   It's more like the question of what do you do
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.420]   when you actually just have a webpage,
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.620]   what do you do when you have just a document.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.100]   We're not used to, I'm not a lawyer,
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.380]   so I'm not used to seeing like legal sized form factor,
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.260]   but it really was a case of, it's not that this is wrong,
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.460]   it's just that Andy, you dim what,
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:14.740]   you're just not used to it.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.900]   So it's all right.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.740]   Now I don't, now I don't see any problem with it.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.780]   And also given that most movies are now being formatted
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:24.020]   for widescreen format, you're losing less information
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.940]   off the screen when you display it that way.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.660]   So there's actually practical benefit for it.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.260]   So again, I was wrong.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:31.940]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.340]   Hey, we're filing a copyright.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.020]   (all cheering)
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.660]   A trick interlaced, yay.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.020]   - Brave, come on man.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.260]   - Brave, yeah.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.620]   How can you be watching Brave?
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.820]   - I know, I think Pixar's gonna make versions of that
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.820]   for on the Google Play Store that just stutter
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.980]   and stop randomly and like pop on it.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.060]   - And they're trailer, it's okay.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.780]   We can broadcast trailers, can't we?
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.900]   - No, no, you want to see movies that I've ripped, hang on.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.460]   (all laughing)
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.300]   - You mentioned--
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.660]   - Are you not right, Bryce, is anybody?
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.380]   - You mentioned earlier MG Sigler's review in TechCrunch.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.220]   - Right.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.260]   - And he is of course a virulent--
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.300]   - Well, he would dispute the fact that he's an Apple fanboy,
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.420]   but I think the rest of the world--
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.540]   - I would say he's a virulent explainer
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.620]   of the Apple position.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.460]   - Thank you.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.780]   - You have to be a safe way to put it.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.140]   - Okay.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.100]   - And I love his writing, but his point was like,
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.140]   he leaves the iPad on the couch
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.860]   and he would take the seven and three minute--
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.780]   - Well, that was kind of a revelation to him.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.260]   Was that he would pick this up out of choice.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.140]   That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.300]   I don't know how I'm gonna react on this.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.660]   I am an Android fanboy, I admit it.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.580]   I use a Galaxy S3, I still have an iPad and an iPhone,
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.140]   and I love them and I'll buy the new iPhone,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.500]   but I've been, I was early on the Android bandwagon,
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.700]   I like Android, and so I'm glad to see people who,
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.980]   one might think didn't have open minds
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.820]   to something like this saying, yeah, you know what,
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.660]   this isn't that bad, that's a good sign.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.860]   - Well, and to Andy's point, it's content,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.980]   and the medium is the message.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.260]   If there's something that you would like to read,
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.820]   if you like to do reading in bed, then--
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.940]   - The small size does work, doesn't it?
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.780]   - The small size, you can hold it easier.
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.620]   - You don't want to be tired.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.460]   - You don't want to be tired.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.300]   - You don't want to be tired.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.300]   - You're the only two people in the world
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.140]   who liked the Kindle Fire.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:11.980]   - We both like--
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.820]   - A lot of people like the Kindle Fire,
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.460]   which is actually my other question about--
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.700]   - Well, this is so much better because it's fast.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.500]   - But here's the thing that Apple and Amazon have,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   which is retail outlets and relationships with customers
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.620]   that pay money in a way that Google doesn't.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.300]   - So how does Google get this in front of people?
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.140]   - Yeah, and that's the thing,
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.780]   King of the Fire, they blew off the shelves
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.700]   'cause every time you went to Amazon to buy anything,
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.620]   it was like, "By the way, $200,"
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.740]   and it kind of looks like an iPad,
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.580]   and it's getting decent reviews, I don't know,
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.940]   just add it to your card, what do you do?
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.300]   - Right, it's easy.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.380]   - You know, like, and Apple obviously has
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.580]   these fantastic destinations where you can go.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.340]   They look amazing, they have commercials that look great,
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.940]   they have a relationship with consumers,
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.820]   they have credit cards on hand, Google,
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.300]   that's the one area where Google doesn't have
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.220]   a natural advantage, that people who interact
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.820]   with Google products, except for, I mean, Android users,
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.780]   something that's coming along, but it's relatively new,
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.340]   are by and large, have a relationship that is free.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.940]   You know, even for Android phones,
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.140]   you get your phone as part of your two year contract,
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.140]   it's not like you say, "Well, that thing,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.500]   "that's what I plunked down my heart on money for."
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.300]   - So how does Google get this in front of people?
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.460]   Do they sell it at Best Buy, or are they?
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.220]   - Actually, I wanted to look it up,
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.780]   but yeah, this is being ordered from Staples, Office Depot,
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.940]   GameStop, Sam's Club, I'm not sure if that meant online
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.740]   or in brick and mortar.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.380]   - Right, so in theory anyway.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.060]   - Well, I think it's at Sam's Club and Costco's,
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.740]   but you know, if you've been to a Sam's Club and Costco's,
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:39.220]   it will be another new tablet, another new Android tablet.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.060]   - We were talking about that on Twitter.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.700]   - There's been a lot of them before, and they've all blown.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.740]   - That's why Apple has a great advantage by the Apple store.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.740]   It's why Microsoft's doing Microsoft stores more and more.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:53.900]   Even Sony, Samsung just announced they're gonna do stores.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.900]   There is an advantage to having the exclusivity.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.020]   - They got a little static, right?
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.700]   Because they look a little too appily.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.100]   - No, you saw that the judge in England
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.180]   who said that Samsung's not cool enough
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.540]   to have actually stolen this, so they're off the hook.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.780]   They don't have the cool fact.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.820]   - And then the judge danced off like a shadow.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.340]   - I think that's very strange.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.180]   It's a very strange ruling.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.420]   - I'm sorry, clarifying, yes,
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.140]   there is available actually in retail stores.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.500]   It's not just like Staples.com.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.900]   - Okay, good.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.700]   That'll help.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.100]   I'm sure they worked very hard at it,
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.380]   to get make that possible.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.580]   - But there's also the dimension where so much
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.540]   of what's available on the Google Play Store
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.020]   is not necessarily available internationally.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.540]   So Apple is selling iPads and iPhones
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.420]   in every single country.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.740]   They can sell content in every single country.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.820]   They have one hell that had start over everybody.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.620]   - Yeah, and that's why if numbers for this,
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.260]   and Andy, from what I play with it,
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.980]   from hearing you and hearing other people
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.740]   whose opinions I very much respect,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:56.180]   that they looks like this is a big leap forward
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:58.460]   in terms of, especially a tablet,
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.940]   this form factor and certainly at this price,
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.940]   I would just worry that in the context
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.300]   of how consumers will initially see it,
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.420]   that it will be just another tablet.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.300]   And I don't know if it's immediately going to catch on.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.860]   - But that cut the question.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.580]   I'm watching you on TV.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.140]   - You're listening to that really rambly point yet again.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.980]   - Yeah, again. - Because it wasn't
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:21.820]   long enough the first time.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.660]   - I'll turn off the audio.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.620]   That looks pretty good though.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.460]   - This is one of a number of third party apps on Android for a
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.300]   Twitter.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.500]   I think it's F-Con.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.380]   And this is going to get a little weird in a moment.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.420]   - Oh, you're watching yourself, watching yourself.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   (laughing)
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.260]   How many?
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.260]   - There's Robert.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.460]   There's just Robert.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.300]   - I like this.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.380]   I think this actually looks pretty good.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.980]   - Oh, it looks absolutely great.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   We'll get some HD movies on it.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.460]   And it just looks brilliant.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.940]   It's just a wonderful device.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.140]   But what you're saying, it does cut both ways.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.420]   Something that I've been sort of curious to find out is,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.980]   do people love the iPad or do they just love the idea
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.660]   of a tablet computer that works great?
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.580]   'Cause so far they haven't really had the opportunity
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.220]   to make that choice.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.020]   So what happened, I think it'll be fascinating.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.140]   Apple, excuse me, if and when Apple comes out
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:16.500]   with a smaller sized iPad mini and the Google,
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.660]   and the Nexus 7 is widely available
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.100]   and maybe a third party will come out
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.300]   with a good $220 tablet.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.420]   When people have the choice of simply choosing
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.300]   whatever they want to choose in that form factor,
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.100]   will they necessarily gravitate towards the iPad
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.060]   because it's fundamentally better?
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.260]   Or will they buy the Nexus 7
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.740]   because there's an Office Max
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.100]   that's where they buy rubber bands two times a month
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.980]   and they saw one and they had an extra 200 bucks,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.100]   they came home with one, then they're as happy with it
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.020]   as they would have been with an iPad.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.020]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.900]   I'm really keen to find out what it is.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.220]   I think there's a massive market for a $200, $250 tablet.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.060]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.260]   And I think that that's gonna really propel this forward.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.140]   And Apple, we don't know what the price is.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.860]   No. Very surprised if they come down to that level.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.340]   But maybe they will.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.140]   At that point, Apple wins, don't you think?
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.540]   I mean, you have a choice between a seven inch iPad
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.100]   for 250 bucks or a seven inch Android.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.180]   You're gonna go with the iPad, right?
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.940]   I would because I have spent a lot of time
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.060]   with both devices and I think that I could talk
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.180]   anybody's ear off on the differences between the two
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.700]   and I can really define what I want.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.420]   But I come back to my waitress to the diner.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.020]   They are not necessarily, or waitress to the diner,
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.620]   who simply said, I like the form factor, I like the price,
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.340]   it works great, I'm, the five minutes I spent with it
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.780]   in my hands, it seems to work very, very nice.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.140]   So that's, I'd be willing to buy one if I had an extra 10,
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:36.980]   200 bucks.
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.580]   I also keep coming back to the example
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.620]   of how I react to cars.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.300]   I mean, in another podcast, I talked about my love
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.620]   for the crown Victoria,
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.940]   which I think is just a cool looking car.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.340]   It's been a lot of time in the back seat of this.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.660]   I was gonna say.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:52.500]   Exactly.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.660]   I'm not going to get off this.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.060]   I don't know why.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.300]   Do they all have power?
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.980]   The metal grid in between the front and the back seat.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:01.820]   I think it's standard.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:02.660]   Yeah, okay.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.500]   Let's check.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.340]   Anyone I want to buy.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.540]   Well, they make the police version of it,
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.020]   they make the limousine version of it.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.980]   I just love the styling of it, of this car,
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.540]   that is designed not to attract attention,
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.740]   but the fact that it's designed not to attract attention
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.660]   means that it's the focus of every car on the highway.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.380]   That's too unhip a car not to be a smoky.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.780]   And so, but people say, oh my God,
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:28.740]   well, look, here are eight cars that you should buy
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.900]   instead of a crown Victoria.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.740]   It says, oh, they're terrible, they're terrible.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.380]   And the thing is, and they're all right,
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.340]   they're all right about, I'm sure about the handling of cars,
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.340]   about the power of the engine, about the service,
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.340]   about all the stuff like that.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.540]   But I'm the sort of car buyer who, if I saw,
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.700]   I used a Crown Vic in good condition
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.900]   at the price that I wanted to pay for a car like that,
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.340]   I drive off the lot with it,
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.820]   and I'd be very, very happy with it,
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.580]   and I'd put another 80,000 miles on it
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.460]   before it would fall apart, like the blues mobile
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.980]   in the middle of Chicago.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.100]   And I would be blissfully ignorant of the fact
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.780]   that I bought an inferior car.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.180]   And I always come back.
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.100]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.020]   Did you say the blues mobile?
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.100]   106 miles to Chicago.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.940]   We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.700]   It's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.700]   Get it.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.820]   For me, the most--
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.980]   Now these episodes definitely get pulled.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:22.100]   I know it's a bad idea to buy a secondhand cop car
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.340]   or a secondhand taxi.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.820]   But every time-- I see the--
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.380]   I subscribe to the government auction sites.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:31.660]   And every time I see a used Crown Vic that looks good,
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.620]   all I can think of is Elle with talking to Jake.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:35.580]   He's got a cop motor.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.620]   He's got a cop shock.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.420]   Cop suspension.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.940]   He was built before catalytic inverters
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.740]   were running good on regular gas.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.540]   And we're like, I want a cop engine.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:44.020]   I want a cop engine.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.460]   We're going to take a break.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.340]   Andy and I go, Justin, Robert Young, and Leo Leport
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.180]   talking about anything we damn well want to talk about.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.220]   Yeah, make something of it.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.380]   They will, believe me.
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.340]   And he's wearing sunglasses.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.460]   But first, you know what?
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.860]   I was thinking, if you were in the market for a new tablet.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.380]   Sure.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.100]   You might want to disabuse yourself of the old tablet.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.580]   Now you could just throw it in the closet.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.700]   And add it to that great big pile of gadgets there already.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.900]   Or you could go to gazelle.com and keep it moving.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.700]   Gazelle is the easy way to recycle that gadget and get
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.540]   cash.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.060]   Visit gazelle.com.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.020]   And take a look.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.300]   They made it very simple.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.500]   You know, it's just a dropdown.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.980]   Select the product you want to get rid of.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.260]   Oh, that iPad, huh?
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:29.900]   Get an offer.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.580]   Press the button.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.140]   Now this offer is good for 30 days.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.220]   So you don't have to sell it right away.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.020]   You can sit on it.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.860]   You could think about it.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.420]   I've got the 32 Gig Y5 plus 3G.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.340]   And it's on AT&T.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.900]   The condition is, wow, 320 bucks.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.900]   Yeah, buddy.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.900]   Yeah, buddy.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.940]   That's going to not only get me the Nexus 7, but also a few
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.300]   apps to go along with it.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   Now here's your choice.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.300]   You can get a check.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.300]   You can pay pallet.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:00.900]   Or for an additional 5%, which if I'm not mistaken as another $16,
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.020]   I can use an Amazon gift card on here.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.420]   Might be where you buy it anyway.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.820]   But if you want to buy it.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820]   Right.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.340]   You know, that's a pretty good deal.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.660]   Now they pay the postage on anything worth more than a dollar.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.660]   They take care of it.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.020]   They take the data off of it.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.900]   So you might still want to do that.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.500]   But if it's too much trouble or you forgot to, don't worry.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.900]   The engineers at Gazelle are great about taking stuff off.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.020]   You get fast payment, fair prices, free shipping.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:34.060]   It is the best way to disabuse yourself of old gadgets and get yourself a little cash
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.420]   for purchasing that new gadget.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.580]   So, I'm going to go to the DAZELLE.com lock in that quote for 30 days.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.020]   But I got to tell you, do it today because I can tell you something I know for sure.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.340]   Tomorrow it's worth less, less, less, less, less, less all the way.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.980]   No gadget, no gadget has ever gone up in value.
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   Maybe in 100 years when it's an antique, do you want to wait that long?
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.980]   No.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.380]   Well, here's what you do is you have.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.380]   You put it in a time capsule.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Exactly.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   Well, you shrink wrap it.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.860]   You know, and you keep it a mile under the earth.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.860]   In a salt mine.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.140]   And then old film footage.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.380]   And then cross your fingers that it might be worth something in 100 years.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.780]   We're coming up now.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.100]   It's getting closer and closer to when we're going to start hearing firm dates on when
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:22.580]   things like big announcement that's probably going to be the iPad mini or iPhone.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580]   That's when the price goes down.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.580]   Do it now.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.580]   Do it now.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580]   Lock it in now.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   Lock it in now.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580]   You could lock it in for 30 days and you're still good.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.580]   Absolutely.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.580]   They have paid.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.580]   Get this.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.100]   You know, 100,000 customers.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.900]   This is a good company doing a great service with a great product.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.900]   I want you to try it.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.180]   And if they ask you, just tell them you heard it on Mac break weekly.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.060]   I don't think they ask you.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.300]   But if they just yell at them.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   You know what?
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   Hey, you know what?
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.980]   You know how I tweet it.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.980]   Mac bro.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.900]   You know what this would do me a good favor.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.900]   Tweet it.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.620]   If you sell something in Gazelle, tweet what you sold it for.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.620]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.140]   And what your experience has been at Gazelle.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.140]   And just mentioned you heard it.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.040]   I'm saying I'm going to hashtag Mac cash.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.780]   Listen in the Mac break weekly.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   That's all I want.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780]   That's all I ask.
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   Gazelle.com.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:18.360]   So Google is paying a fine of $22.5 million because of hacking your Safari on iOS, which
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   is chicken feed.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.100]   But I got to point out the largest fine the FTC has ever given a private company.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.100]   Wow.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.820]   $22.5 million.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:33.020]   That was that thing where they bypassed the block third party cookies on iPhone in order
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:38.160]   to make the Google plus button work, the plus one button work.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.960]   And now, you know, they have Chrome, which I have to say looks, I like it on iOS, but
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.920]   it can never be the default browser because Apple doesn't play that way.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   So they've got code, Google's putting out code on how you do an app on iPhone or iPad
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.200]   that checks to see if Chrome's there and will launch links in Chrome if it is.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.360]   So this is for developers.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   Like if you can't do anything about this, then you can put it in.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:11.040]   And so this, I think is similar unless I'm confusing things that like in like I have a
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.040]   tweet bot.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.040]   Tweet bot.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.280]   So when you click a link in tweet bot, it could launch Chrome.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.520]   It doesn't send you to Safari.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.600]   It sends it to their internal browser.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.720]   So you're staying inside there.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.080]   And if in tweet bar, yeah, if in tweet bar, you save you on the web, it will then launch
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.440]   Safari between bot or any other developer could put code in that says, check if they have
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.880]   Chrome in the reasonable presumption.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.360]   If somebody has Chrome, they actually want you to open stuff in Chrome, right?
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.280]   Yes, or no.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.720]   I mean, maybe I have opera on my phone.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   Doesn't mean I'll use opera.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.400]   Yeah, I don't really want opera to open.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.320]   You know, I would I would be kind of annoyed if there was one app I had that was just really
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.360]   super opera fanboys that were like, well, you really should be using it because it's
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.840]   got a lot of extra features.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.600]   That was the only sponsor.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   Opera.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   Oh, no.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   Justin, you're fun to have a row.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.320]   I know.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.760]   He's a good sidekick.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760]   Exactly.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.360]   He's kind of meant to be a sidekick.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.760]   Is that why you were in a jacket?
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   Sure.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.720]   I actually then I'm going to tap dance a little bit later.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720]   Second banana.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   That's me.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.880]   That's my middle name.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   Second banana.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.320]   Justin, second banana young.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.440]   No, we love having you on Justin moved to the Bay Area recently.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.160]   That's why we're fortunate and we can get a lot more of you.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   So I'm doing NSFW live here.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   I love that.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   Thank you.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.160]   I love that.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   Thank you.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.720]   And I've been doing TNT and you know that that Brian Brushwood soon going to become the
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.320]   second banana because you're here.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320]   I know.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320]   He's on the he's on the screen.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.800]   He's freaking all the second banana brush.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Didn't.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   So there.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   So there.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.080]   So actually I that's a very good point, Justin, that somebody just because they have
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.720]   a browser doesn't mean they want it to be the default browser.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.680]   I mean, there's a reason, you know, if the content of your app, you know, particularly
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.080]   works well in Chrome or runs faster or for some reason is I would like experience.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.000]   I would love it to be the default browser, but you can't change that in iOS or you want
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.480]   to do this incredibly radical thing on an iOS device, which is let the user make a decision
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.240]   about what he or she might go.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240]   I mean, that's crazy.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.360]   You mean, you mean like have a preference?
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.160]   Like on the desktop have a preference.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.400]   I should have drunk all that cough syrup.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.880]   Andy, I don't know.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.600]   Andy, you're going to you're going to be you're going to become a post state here on the on
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.840]   the Mac break weekly show.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.280]   No, I just had my check up.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.600]   My doctor did that horrible thing.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   Got a good post state.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Okay.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.520]   Can I ask you guys so this Merissa Mayer thing breaks?
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.400]   We haven't mentioned that we should mention that massive.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.640]   It's not a Mac story, but it's an interesting story.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.320]   Here's how I was just for those of you who are going, what?
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.760]   Merissa Mayer story.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.480]   She of course is the 20th hire at Google and a very, very well known Google engineer for
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   a long time.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.240]   Ran search was the person in charge of the design of the Google search page and was widely praised
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.880]   for keeping it simple, keeping it elegant.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:06.760]   Recently kind of side loaded over to location, which is still very important.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.480]   I think though, I have to say she's not was not made part of the operating group at Google,
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.920]   which is the group with them all of the power.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.880]   And I'm kind of not surprised that a few months later, she's taken the job of running Yahoo.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.280]   She's the new CEO at Yahoo.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.400]   Kind of a shock.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.280]   Was not mentioned in any of the lists of potential CEOs.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.720]   In fact, remember there were two candidates, the current interim CEO and the CEO at Hulu
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.400]   who very quickly said, "I know, please, no, no, I don't want to run Yahoo."
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.520]   And so we all thought, "Lebinson would keep the job, but now out of nowhere, Merissa Mayer."
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520]   Kind of a surprise.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   So go ahead.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520]   There's the backstory.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.320]   So let me ask you guys this.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:54.240]   Obviously with iOS 6, they're taking a gigantic step forward to get away from Google services
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.880]   with Maps.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:01.080]   Now you have somebody who can kind of bring, let's say theoretically, Merissa Mayer can,
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.840]   to some extent, at least on mobile, kind of write the ship a little bit.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:12.320]   Wouldn't that be interesting if she makes some deals that now if for Apple does Yahoo
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.760]   now represent a more interesting partner for mobile services?
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.800]   Well, you know that Yahoo, which was suing Facebook of a patent lawsuit over social,
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.520]   has gotten in bed with Facebook.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.200]   Well, this is like, their thing now is they're kind of like they moonlight as patent trolls.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.440]   But that suits dropped and now they're best buddies.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.040]   I think Facebook, that's an interesting nexus.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.240]   It's the anti-Google nexus, Facebook, Yahoo, that's a really great observation because
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:46.600]   every time you look at stats on where is all the web traffic going, a huge and disproportionate
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.320]   amount of it is going to iOS devices.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.000]   So if Yahoo said, at least while we rebuild, we're going to make ourselves at the heart
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.640]   of every transaction that every iOS device does, that immediately relegates it from that
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.520]   shop at those mini mall that got grooving out of business when Walmart opened up the other
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:10.160]   end of town to a very, very, very, very, it's just something like a Target store where
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.840]   yes, maybe not, maybe not number one, but all men does it have presence that.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.680]   From all sunglasses to Target.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.720]   Well, look at this.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.600]   This is Cheryl Sandberg, COO at Facebook and one of the most prominent women in Silicon
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   Valley.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.400]   Congratulations to Marissa Mayer.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.800]   She writes on her Facebook page.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.360]   Great news for women and men.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.440]   And men across, you guys okay?
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.640]   It's good news for you too across Silicon Valley.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.280]   All of us at Facebook look forward to working with you in your new role.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.160]   We also want to thank Russ Levinson, the interim CEO for his leadership in real establishing
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.920]   But I think that boy, do you think that would be a good move on Apple to say, hey, we got
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.520]   Facebook, we got Twitter, we don't like Google.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   What about Yahoo?
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   We'll use Yahoo for search.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.640]   We'll use Yahoo for maps.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.080]   We will use Flickr as one of our, as our, as our, if a user wants to expose their iCloud-based
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.320]   photos to the public, we will use Flickr as our transport for that.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   That could be pretty big.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.200]   And also the fact that now remember Yahoo's search is not Yahoo, it's being.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.120]   But even even better.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   Even, I mean, Apple is not necessarily a, we get back to institutional concepts.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.640]   They are institutionally haters of Google.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   Right.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.960]   I don't think, I don't think they would do something to cut, they would cut off their
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.320]   own eyes, nose to spite their face.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.520]   I don't think they hate them that much.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   They are business.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.480]   They're with a good head on the shoulders.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.720]   But if they're putting up that list of pros and cons to working with Yahoo, saying, well,
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.520]   if we help both Yahoo and Microsoft, that puts Google in a much, much worse position.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.200]   Anything that we can do to make sure that Google+ does not become Twitter, anything we
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.800]   can do to make sure that YouTube does, that, that another video service becomes as relevant
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.720]   for personal videos as YouTube is.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.400]   That would be, that would at least get you a second meeting, I think.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.400]   Very interesting.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.160]   And they have to, if they do that, they have to, at the bottom, put a Justin Robert
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   Young joint.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.760]   I'm just saying, I'm just saying, who's the second banana now?
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.360]   Who's the monkey with the gun now?
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   Exactly.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   I'm the monkey with the gun.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   I'm putting together an idea.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.760]   I didn't want, I didn't want to interrupt you.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.960]   You have been at minimum the number one plantain in this.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.360]   You never pick one up and then you try one, said, Hey, you know, maybe I should buy
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   this more regularly.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   Maybe.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   I don't know.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   It went out.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.560]   App purchasing flaw that Apple just can't seem to shut down.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:44.680]   Apple reverses its decision on E-Pete and some hints about when we might see Mountain
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.440]   Lion this month all coming up as we continue.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.280]   Mac break weekly, Justin Robert Young from NSFW is here.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.720]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun times.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.560]   This portion of the show brought to you by our friends at carbonite.com.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.920]   I talk about them a lot and I really hope that this is sinking in.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.720]   But I know it's not because I still get calls all the time on the radio show from people
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:09.200]   who say, Oh, just the other day, I brought my computer in to be fixed.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.600]   And when it came back, my data was gone.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.760]   The guy made a backup.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.080]   But all I have is this one archive.pst file.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.080]   Is that everything?
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.480]   No, it's, it's his old email on outlook.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.560]   See, if you had carbonite, you wouldn't be worrying about this.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.880]   Carbonite is exactly what you need for backup.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.160]   It's got three things that every backup should have one.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   Automatic.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   So you don't have to remember to backup.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.840]   It's just always doing it continuously in the background.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840]   So you make a change.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.600]   That's too automatic, continuous.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.840]   You make a change to a file.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.680]   It's automatically backed up whenever you're online.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.160]   And you know, because it uses SSL 128 bit encryption, even if you're at a open access
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.960]   by the coffee shop or on the road on a hotel, it's using that internet, but it's safe.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   It's secure.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.880]   It's encrypted on the way to the carbonite servers.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.000]   And if you would like to add trust no one encryption, you can.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.320]   Only you have the password.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.320]   Only you have the key.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.720]   Carbonite doesn't have access to your data.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.960]   And I really like that feature for people who really want privacy or need it to be compliant
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.160]   with, you know, HIPAA and other standards.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.800]   The third thing, and I think this is so important, it's offsite.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   It's not a backup sitting next to your computer.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800]   Good idea to have a backup sitting next to your computer.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.400]   You're a near line backup.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.880]   But you should always have an offsite backup and ask Padre, SJ.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   He'll tell you that.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.720]   The IT guy knows this because if the worst happens, if there's a fire, a flood, an earthquake,
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.320]   if the building falls over, somebody breaks in and steals everything, your backups are
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.320]   always safe.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.480]   That's so important.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.280]   And I got to tell you at $59 a year for everything on your internal drive out and everything
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.080]   on a single computer, they also have plans for external drives and multiple computers.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.240]   But the starting price, $59 per year per computer is amazing.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.640]   Less than five bucks a month for everything.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   I want you to try it free.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.160]   15 days free, no credit card needed, just carbonite.com and the offer code MACBreak.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.440]   If you decide to buy, make sure you'd use the code MACBreak when you try it because
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.200]   if you decide to buy, once you've used that offer code, you'll get 14 months for the price
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.840]   of 12, two months free.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.440]   Carbonite.com offer code MACBREAK.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.200]   MAC Break, and we thank them so much for the support of MACBreak Weekly.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.760]   So it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.800]   Apple has blocked or is trying to block the in-app purchasing flaw.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.240]   I didn't know about this and I would never, by the way, it seems to me unethical and rude
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.080]   in the extreme.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:40.840]   But a Russian hacker, Alexei Borodin, has discovered a flaw in iOS in-app purchasing
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:49.160]   that allows iOS device owners, iPad and iPhone owners to download free in-game content, authenticating
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.520]   through this server.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.320]   Now he was running this server in Russia.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.320]   He's moved it.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.200]   Apple brought it down, has asked the ISP to bring it down, but now he's moved it off
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.600]   sure where he says it cannot be accessed.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   Apple.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600]   I move server.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.520]   You know, you can't give me.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.160]   I am now in space.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.320]   So don't worry anybody.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.080]   This is all completely above board.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.080]   Well, and that's the other thing.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.400]   I got to point out, if you are using this server, now he says, no, wait.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.680]   You don't log out of iTunes accounts, so I don't have credentials.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.760]   Then you server.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.480]   And then log back in again so I can capture this one.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.400]   I mean, it's not only immoral, unethical and stealing, you might get ripped off by doing
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   it.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400]   I just got to point this out.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   Apple has pulled.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   It is likely you are.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   I mean, it's not you.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400]   It is highly likely you are getting ripped off.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.840]   Well, I'm not going to say this.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.280]   This guy published a method.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.280]   He published it first.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.080]   He said, if you are using iOS 3 or later, you can quote purchase any kind of in app content
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.280]   for free.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.320]   Without hacking the device, it cannot be prevented by developers using Apple's recommended receipt
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.120]   signing procedures.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.640]   He discovered it and then he created an online service in dash app store.com.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.360]   He's already processed more than 30,000 individual in app payment requests.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.040]   Apple has been pulling down YouTube videos showing how to use it.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.640]   They have been very aggressive about trying to track this guy down.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.520]   This is a quote that they gave the next web, the loop column.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.960]   The security of the app store is incredibly important to us in the developer community.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.260]   Apple representative Natalie Harrison said, "We take reports of fraudulent activity
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.760]   very seriously and we are investigating.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.680]   They block the original server.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.360]   Then he migrated it to a new server.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.480]   Apple was able to pressure the host of the original server in Russia into dropping Borodin.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.360]   But now the new server is on an offshore country."
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.200]   He says, "The new service has been updated."
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.480]   Completely cuts out Apple's servers, improving protocol to include its own authorization and
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.320]   transaction process.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.320]   No message.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.720]   No feature also gives you a dog incredibly explosive guest pain.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:04.720]   Listen squirtle.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.360]   It's been adapted to ensure users cannot use our service without first logging out of
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   iTunes.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.160]   Anyway, don't worry folks.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.880]   Totally safe.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.720]   What Borodin says is, "It's up to Apple to adapt its APIs or place new blocks on service."
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.800]   He says Apple has to fix this.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.200]   I'm just pointing out a security flaw.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   Apparently he's not asking for money.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.480]   Well he's still got to wear a pair of pants that is especially cut for his unique anatomy.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.480]   Yes.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.480]   Oh, no definitely.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.920]   Because I have promised that.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:46.320]   Will those tactical pants accommodate massive cohenes?
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.720]   I think he's got you till a killed grader.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.960]   No, because everything that he says is that we are compliant.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.920]   We moved the server so that he's no longer a pink dog.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.920]   Why are you complaining?
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920]   Well you're complaining.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920]   If you're a problem.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.920]   He says, "a problem, he thinks the problem."
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.040]   Until then why you give me this?
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040]   What is problem here?
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.520]   At least he did.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.480]   I totally think that right after this goes on that he gets a phone call from Tim Cook.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.880]   That's the Liam Neeson call from Taken.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.840]   That was a great call.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840]   Be carefully.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.440]   I have a very special set of skills.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.160]   Shut down your server.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:29.760]   If this were NSFW, I would play that.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   That's not.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.200]   It's a public domain.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.200]   No, no.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   It's public domain.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   Sure.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   No problem.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.200]   What could be wrong?
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.400]   You know how often NSFW is taken down.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.040]   We're not taking that on.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   Constantly.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   Why?
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040]   I get the emails.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040]   You don't get the emails.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.040]   I take it back.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.640]   Most of the time they say, "Well 800 companies in Hollywood have asserted rights to some of
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.680]   the things on NSFW, but we're not going to take it down for now."
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   Okay.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680]   I get that.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.560]   We have to have a billion.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.480]   I ignore it.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.320]   You can buy the ballerina footage that we have.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.480]   You may have ads on there that I don't get any money for.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.800]   But other than that it's all.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.800]   Every time.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   Really.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   Almost every show.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.360]   I wonder if it's just something that we play all time or something.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.600]   Every time you play a clip they want to do a takedown.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.880]   Oh, it probably because we play a lot of clips.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.680]   Yeah, like viral videos and stuff.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.680]   What is that?
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.920]   Oh, that copyrighted content that we constantly play without any hesitation.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920]   Okay.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   That's tough.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.960]   You in frame rate.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.960]   And you know, this is how...
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   Well, that we're in.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   This is in the common denominator is not me.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   This is how...
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   Every frame rate is NSFW.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.040]   Yeah, well, who's the guys on both of those shows?
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.600]   This is how good a boss I am.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.320]   Have I ever complained?
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   Have I ever said anything?
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   No.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   No, it was one.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.920]   There was that one time.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.720]   The one time that we got and it was very within rights because we could have been sued.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.280]   Stay away from libel slander, that kind of thing.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.080]   But as far as the Hollywood goes, do whatever you want.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   No, we go Buckwell bananas.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   It's a hilarious time.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.840]   Okay, where were we?
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.080]   I have no idea.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.280]   Well, Liam Neeson taken Russian hacker.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.440]   Oh, the Russian hacker.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   There we go.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.840]   I mean, I'll say very seriously.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.760]   I think that for Apple to bring all these in-app purchases and make such a big deal about
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   taking their own cut and establishing this as a standard, that's what they're paying
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.760]   for.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760]   That's what...
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.760]   Lock it down.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.320]   Yeah, that's what people are paying for when they give that cut there is that security.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.560]   That's the protection money for the big bad Apple to come down on people like this.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.000]   It is incumbent on them.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.280]   And they've been a rain-holy fire.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.920]   If there's 30,000 people, 30,000 apps in app purchases that aren't going to the developers
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.800]   or Apple, but aren't going to developers, then Apple needs to do something bad besides
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.560]   chasing board and around.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.520]   That's a lot of war eagles from Angry Birds that aren't getting paid for.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.640]   It also shows to the lay person exactly how impressive a DNS attack can be.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.960]   The reason why this whole works is that you install a new certificate that says that any
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:11.880]   time that any app on your Mac needs to resolve a URL, don't go through the normal way you
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:17.200]   use this special server that's been trained to say that this server over here is actually
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.400]   Apple's iTunes Store server.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.720]   And that's how it manages to intercept what the iTunes Store is doing.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.320]   And so that any time there's a piece of malware that can do that same trick, you could be
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.840]   thinking going to Google, you could think you're going to Amazon, but you're actually
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.040]   going to invisibly another site.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.440]   So this is going to come up in the future, I think.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.800]   Couple of your install this certificate.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   Okay.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.880]   You free magic berries for your all bubble of apples.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.200]   Apparently according to nine to five Mac, Apple stores are having over nights.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.120]   This is what you suspected and we suspected July 24th.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.560]   There of course, their quarterly earnings Carl is July 24th and the last quarterly earnings
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.200]   call they said, Oh, and by the way, he'll be able to get lying tomorrow.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.320]   And so the thinking was maybe this time they would do it again.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:08.360]   And yeah, true enough, according to whispers according nine to five Mac Apple stores in
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:14.720]   the US and overseas are planning over nights for Tuesday, July 24th.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:20.000]   Seems like that means a launch of mountain lion on the 25th.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.600]   Now how crazy, because I mean, I've been listening to the say this specific podcast for a very
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.680]   long time.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:33.520]   And in the earlier days when I was listening to it, the idea of an overnight for an OS release
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.440]   would seem good point, especially since you can't buy this OS release.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.720]   You have to go to the app store and download it.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.320]   What do they need to stay open for?
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.840]   Well, because they still have a lot of machines, they have to upgrade.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.640]   Oh, there might be training involved is almost certainly going to be signage involved horse.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.920]   Oh, it's probably it's probably something I there was a time when I'd be excited.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.840]   Oh, look, they wouldn't be shutting down the entire store.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.080]   They wouldn't be keeping fifth.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.880]   Like no, I've since talked to like people who like managed stores saying you wouldn't
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.120]   believe that there even even when there's a note saying, hi, we decided that we want the
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:09.360]   16 gigabyte iPads to be to the left of the 64 gigabyte iPads and so to the right, that's
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.600]   like, oh, man, who's going to have to pull overtime to make that happen.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.320]   So yeah, no, that's a very good point.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.240]   In fact, nine to five even points out that this is not unusual to have Tuesday overnight.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:22.240]   So but given the fact they said it was going to ship in July, having a slumber party where
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.960]   they do each other's hair.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.880]   Boy, it's like an old church lock in right planning a twit slumber party, by the way,
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.880]   stay tuned for details.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.440]   Would you like a series thing?
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.200]   Yeah, I want to have a slumber party here.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.360]   Like what's going to happen?
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.760]   Well, I was thinking to do it on the 24th.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   Oddly enough, the 24th is the anniversary, the one year anniversary of moving into this
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   studio.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.160]   Yeah, but if Apple's going to have an overnight the same night, then all the cool kids will
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.960]   be going to apples.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   Yeah, we'll do a couple of every every every every like regular like hosts and guest brings
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.200]   a covered dish.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.320]   Okay, I think we should livestream it.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:01.120]   We should all like ring the bell like one of those old, you know, TV specials and it's
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.960]   like, oh, it's an a seven W.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.440]   You know, bring a casserole or I could just get a stick and go.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.120]   Oh, yeah, Justin robot.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.600]   And you know, you do have to have three three names to get in there.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   Sure.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.240]   Apple has reversed its course on EP, a letter from Bob Mansfield outgoing SVP of hardware
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.920]   says, we made a mistake pulling out of the recycling program that Apple and other consumer
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   electronics companies had put together with the EPA.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.080]   Apple takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.960]   meet the strictest energy efficiency standards.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.880]   We're not talking about any G star here.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.800]   We're talking about recyclability.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.680]   They also say we lead the industry by reporting its products, products, greenhouse gas emissions.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:57.200]   Apple products are superior and other important environmental areas not measured by EP.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.720]   But we're not talking about that.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.160]   We're talking about recyclability.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:06.200]   So after hearing perhaps that city of San Francisco would be no longer buying Apple products because
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.680]   they aren't EP certified.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:13.600]   This is the United States government for motor company, a lot of big companies.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.120]   Mansfield writes the letter saying we recently heard from many loyal Apple customers who
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.600]   were disappointed to learn we had removed our products from the EP rating system.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.400]   I realize this was a mistake starting today all eligible.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.040]   And I underscore eligible here.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.600]   Apple products are back on EP.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.720]   The iPhone has never been EP nor has the iPad unknown.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.520]   What that means some have said that the retina display is EP certified now.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.560]   Well, no, how many times is that word not ascribed to another company appeared on Apple
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.920]   mistake letterhead mistake?
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.680]   I've never heard Apple say that ever because then with antenna gate Apple never admitted
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680]   wrong to use.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.320]   We've heard the word hobby.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.320]   Yes.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.000]   The Apple TV wasn't a mistake.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   It was a hobby.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.480]   Although I love my Apple TV and live on my Apple TV.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.720]   It was a police action, not a war.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.200]   But there's a bit of a history.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.960]   I mean, they didn't have a spat with Greenpeace.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.720]   Greenpeace has been targeting them for a long time.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.640]   And they came back and they go with them.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.000]   Yeah, and I don't think fairly.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.440]   I think that Greenpeace just realized this is a big, big company with a lot of left wing
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.760]   supporters so we can go after them more easily than let us go.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:32.040]   That gets the thing that if you go after Apple, you'll get a lot more results if you go
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.720]   after Dell for instance, who cares about Dell.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:40.840]   But I wonder if this means that they've, when they use the word mistake, maybe internally
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:46.760]   they mean it was a mistake to drop out of the program instead of just lobbying violently
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.160]   internally with the committee to change how they define the certification for these devices.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160]   Right.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   Because I don't hear them changing the way they make the devices.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.720]   Yeah, because that is a design thing.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.240]   It's not, it's, it doesn't mean as much as I love the planet and as a person without
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.200]   kids, I really could care what happens 20 years after I die.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:10.600]   You know, but, but in all seriousness, even there, I'm like, if you mean that you have
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.240]   that everything has to be made out of like, you, nothing can be made as a nice tight glued
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.240]   sandwich.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.280]   It has to be done with screws.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.320]   You have to be able to separate every component from every other component.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.160]   And I just, I just took a look at the specs a couple of days ago.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.720]   I gave it a very cursory look.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:27.720]   So I could be completely wrong.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.320]   But a lot of it really is that it was the disassemble ability of some of these products
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   was caused in the violation.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   It wasn't, it wasn't as though that, you know, they were painting the logo on with mercury.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Right.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.120]   It was things that were kind of more subtle than that.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.680]   So I wonder if they're going to have some, something that simply says quietly with it
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.400]   with a committee that here is how we don't believe that though our manufacturing process
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.280]   creates a problem, would it be possible to amend the certification that says, "Well,
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.040]   it says that so long as there is in store recycling so that we will take back this offending
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.760]   product and we will pay the money to have this disassembled correctly and then recycled,
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.080]   will you then allow us to have that certification?"
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.160]   I really think that's how this is going to end.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.880]   Well, this has all the hallmarks of an internal argument between E.P.T. and Apple that ended
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.120]   in Apple saying, "Well, whatever," you know, or E.P.T. saying, "Well, then you're not
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.720]   E.P.T. certified anymore."
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.600]   And it went public and then was immediately kind of corrected because I totally agree
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   with Andy.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.440]   I think that Apple would much rather have a conversation with them about how they are
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.800]   even better than their standards and have E.P.T.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.760]   agreed to it.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   We're going to take a break.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:39.400]   When we come back, we have a picks of the week from Justin, Andy, and myself.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:45.200]   I should mention that the folks who do Angry Birds have a new iOS game called Amazing Alex.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.680]   It might be worth getting.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.360]   I don't think Alex Lindsay is a part of it, but we'll find out.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.040]   That was a reboot of Alex, the Alex trilogy by Sam Raimi earlier in the decade.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.480]   I'm joking, like Amazing Spider-Man.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   Clockwork Orange, the video game.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   Yes.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.480]   Have a long little trill keys.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480]   Would you like more trill keys?
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   That I would buy.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.880]   But no cricket bat, you seem to have blood all over them.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.560]   A word from audible.com.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.800]   You know, I should check and see if Clockwork Orange is unaudible.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.520]   I bet it is.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:25.080]   That is the most amazing twist in the novel, right in the second or third chapter.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.680]   Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess, narrated by Tom Hollander.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   There's also a dramatization.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.080]   See, audible is great.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.480]   You know, you love audible.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.080]   Over 100,000 books in audio.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   I mean, just, I don't, this is risky, but I'm going to play a little clip of a Clockwork
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.080]   Orange here.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:51.040]   I like to see the movies, but I always will listen to the book before I go to the movie
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:56.880]   because the books, when they're read it like this by great actors, are really a movie in
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.880]   your head.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   I don't, I can't get this to play.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   I'm not sure.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   Something wrong.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.360]   Probably don't have something installed.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360]   You can play it though.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360]   Go to audible.com.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   Browse around.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.320]   Take a look at the books and pick something because I'm going to show you how you can
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.840]   get a book for free.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.000]   Alex, I mean, sorry.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.680]   Andy, what are you listening to this week?
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:20.640]   Actually, funny as you should mention the books based on movies, I saw the movie, the
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.440]   big year with Steve Martin and Owen Wilson and Jack Black just hit like cable TV.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.800]   So you get only nine opportunities a day to see it.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.680]   So, so after the first time, actually enjoyed it.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.920]   I thought it was a good, a good movie.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.280]   Move from there to, I wonder, I wondered how Birders actually thought about the movie.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.000]   So I'm reading Birders blog and say, wow, they actually turned us with respect and dignity.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   They got so many details, right?
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.000]   And if they got a few things wrong was for the story, this is a great movie.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.640]   It represents us well.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.160]   And then made me think, well, what, what, now I want to read the book that's, that this
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.760]   was based on, it was based on the big year is when Birders decide to spend an entire year
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:05.640]   of their lives trying to spot as many birds as they possibly can in the United States.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.080]   And there are records kept about who got the, had the, had the most birds in the year.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.200]   So the book actually follows three different Birders.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.480]   It tracks very loosely with the movie, but it tracks three very, very different kinds
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.600]   of Birders as they undertake the big year in the same year.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.000]   And I just, it, I, you know how much I love audiobooks to be in with.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.280]   I could have, I could have bought the Kindle.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.280]   I decided to get the audiobook because the reader was just so, had so much of a Birder
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.520]   sort of voice about them.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:41.340]   It was, it passed my highest test where not only do I sort of circle around in the car
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:46.000]   to listen to a little bit more of it, what I got inside the house, I still had my phone.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.040]   I had my earphones plugged in and I was walking around doing housework and listening to the
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.680]   rest of that chapter.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   Wow.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.160]   It's not fiction, it's nonfiction, but he does such a good, it's one of those great nonfiction
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.160]   writers.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:05.360]   It's called The Big Year, A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl Obsession by Mark Ob, O-B-M-A-S-C-I-K
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.320]   Obas, Ob, Ob-Mastic, Ob-Mastic.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.840]   I'm not getting that right.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.000]   All of my blood.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   The only bad, the only hardening.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   You know it?
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   It's, it's, it's Obama with a chick at the end.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.880]   See, that's, that's what, that's what, how your brain trips you up.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.280]   Oh, Obama, I know how to, no, it's not Obama.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:25.840]   Obama, look, I'm telling you, don't try to pronounce it like Obama, but it's Obama.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.400]   It's not Obama.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.400]   It's Om-Mastic.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   Om-Mastic.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:35.000]   But the, it's, it's, he's a great author in that he really takes real world people and
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.320]   turns them into colorful characters by getting in every single detail of what their day is
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.040]   like, what their priorities are like.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:48.080]   You have one person who is, you would imagine the, the, the, the archetype you picture in
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.920]   your mind of the obsessed birder who just is always about getting the next one, getting
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.160]   the next side and getting the next side.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.920]   You have this other person who's spent, who's been, had the secret obsession all his life,
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:05.080]   but he's been busy with business, uh, working up the recompe and only now that he's retired,
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:09.240]   can he finally live, live his passion, which is to spend lots of time in Colorado looking
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   for birds.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.760]   And this third guy who is the younger guy, the Jack Black character as it turns out,
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.360]   uh, in his younger guy recently divorced, kind of at a crossroads and he needs a new
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:22.440]   project to sort of focus on to take his mind off the fact that he's recently divorced.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.360]   He doesn't know what he's going to be doing for the next five years or so.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.720]   Uh, and again, these are real life characters, but the way that he portrays these, you would
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.800]   think that they're a fiction.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.200]   Uh, and so I'm really enjoying this a lot.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.520]   I think I'm only on chapter like four, uh, three or four, but I'm like our number, our
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.800]   number two of what I think is like a seven or eight hour book, uh, but another very strong
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.800]   recommendation.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:49.040]   All you got to do is go to audible.com and, uh, sign up for the gold account.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.520]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, you get your first month free.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.080]   That means your first credit's free and, uh, you can pick any book and it's yours to keep
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.440]   canceling anytime, pay nothing, but keep that book forever.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.280]   You were saying you had something you, uh, I am an audible subscriber from getting the
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.040]   code from being a Mac break.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040]   Good man.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.040]   Good man.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:14.440]   And the series that I'm now in the middle of is they have redone their new audio books
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.200]   for the, uh, Admiral Thrawn trilogy of Star Wars.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.520]   Uh, this is all they remaster them just like they, they, they screwed up the original.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.000]   Did they take charge out?
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   Come on.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.280]   So you know how easy it is to do, cut copy and paste.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.480]   It's much easier than digital technology.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:37.400]   Uh, so basically I guess previously, and I know on audible, they only had a bridged versions
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.040]   that were done that were read by Anthony Daniels.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.440]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.680]   Uh, however, these are done by Mark Thompson, who does a fantastic job.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.760]   These are all the original characters from the original trilogy.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.560]   So you have Luke, Leia, Han Solo, uh, and then a bunch of other different new characters
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.400]   that kind of come into this particular story, including Grant and Moulthrawn, who the story
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.720]   kind of revolves around.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.160]   But Mark Thompson is a fantastic narrator.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.680]   And I've only listened to the first one.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.720]   I'm actually downloading because I, oh, my credit's just renewed today.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:14.840]   Uh, the second volume, which just came out in 2012, uh, but they also have all the sound
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   effects.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.440]   I'm not a huge sound effect.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.360]   An audio book guy, like I kind of just like the, the reading itself.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.920]   Here's a, here's a little bit of this Mark Thompson to serve as a bridge officer aboard
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.160]   a ship like the ship in the background.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.840]   He looked down at the equally young man at the engineering model.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   That's nice.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.840]   Now in contrast.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.840]   It's good when it's virtually.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.840]   Right.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.480]   You know, you guys are too mean to bring it's not distracting.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.600]   It's kind of just makes you feel like you're there.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.800]   And, you know, for Chewbacca for our two D two instead of it.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.800]   You're saying part two D two chirped.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.800]   Right.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.400]   You're our two D two lights, papers.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   I mean, it's fantastic.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.160]   So if you like Star Wars, uh, it's a, it's awesome.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   And it's a trilogy.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.680]   So there's three of them, but get the first one free audible.com slash Mac break, pick,
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.400]   plays back on all your iOS devices on your laptops, your desktops, uh, Android devices.

[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]   It looks great.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.480]   Works great.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.720]   Audible.com slash Mac break.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.320]   We thank them for their support.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.040]   Let's start with our picks of the week.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.160]   Andy, your camera sling.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.800]   Yeah, this is now, this is something I've been really hoping for for a long, long time.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.520]   It's called the sun sniper.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.320]   Uh, uh, okay.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.320]   That was good.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.760]   And they have three, they have three different models and I forget what it's called that
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.760]   was called the sun sniper strap server.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.600]   Um, those are you in the interest.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600]   Exactly.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.400]   Well, in the past, in the past few years that a lot of companies have come up with camera
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.160]   slings, instead of wearing a camera around your neck through a strap, it's actually over
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.720]   the shoulder sling and the thing like rides on, on a bearing so you can slide it up when
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.720]   you need it.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.720]   Then let's let it dangle by your hip when you're not using it.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:59.920]   Uh, however, I almost always am, am wearing when I'm walking around some sort of a bag
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.360]   like this, especially like when I'm in a city.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.440]   So I have one of those slings that works great, but I have to make sure that I have
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.440]   the stack order correctly.
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.120]   So I have to make sure I have the bag on and then the sling and then when I sit down
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.680]   and for lunch, I have to make sure I take it up correctly.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.160]   This company has made this beautiful sling that actually integrates into whatever bag
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.680]   you already have.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.160]   So it, this is, this is what the, this is what the component is.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.120]   And so you have this free floating thing that's, that's, that goes into the, uh, the tripod
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.680]   mount of your camera.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.360]   And then it has this really cool little catch right here that the strap of your bag goes
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:39.360]   through and it comes apart very simply when you actually want it to come apart.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.880]   And it's actually held together by two magnets like this.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.120]   And as you can see, people who are listening on podcasts, it's actually two halves that
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.400]   snap apart and it turns into sort of like this Z shaped thing when it's taken apart.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.760]   Uh, there's one that's sort of what the hook is one way, the other part of the hook is
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.760]   the other way.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   But when you click these back together magnetically around the strap, now there's actually no play
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.200]   that your camera can escape.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.280]   And this is, you'll, you'll find out in a second why I'm explaining how well made this
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.280]   thing is.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.280]   This is all steel.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   It's all metal.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   It will not come apart yet.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.160]   It's really easy to take on and take off when you wanted to the bearing over here is
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.640]   also all machine metal has a thick rubber grommet.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.320]   You really dog it down tight.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.680]   So you squat flatten and squeeze this.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.440]   It's not going to come loose from dead end of the camera.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.640]   They even thought about they're going to, they made the strap part of it adjustable.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.560]   So that's sometimes you've got like an SLR.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.040]   So you need to actually lift it up to, uh, to eye height.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.280]   So then you can adjust this long so that you can actually lift up to your eye.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.160]   Maybe that you're, maybe though you're using like the LCD view, fine.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.480]   You don't flip it up quite so high.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.920]   So you can adjust it that way.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.960]   And knowing that you might be walking around with this thing, this expensive camera would
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:56.520]   be at a $500 compact system or $2,000 SLR, you know, in a, in a tourist area.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.920]   They may actually made sure that this can, this strap, there's a little bump here that
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.360]   you might be able to see.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.880]   It's actually reinforced with steel so that someone can't just simply cut through the
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:11.120]   kit, cut through the strap and walk off with your $2,000 camera.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.400]   This is all by way of explaining that this simple thing costs a hundred bucks.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.560]   Wow.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.800]   It's a hundred bucks, but if you're going to try it, it's, it seems a lot.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.880]   Well, it's, it's made as well as you could possibly make a device like this.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.320]   And also if you were going to, I'm sure that there's a way to make this so that it only
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.040]   costs 30 or 40 bucks where you decide, well, what, what if this ended?
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.560]   What if the tripod end of it wasn't so secure?
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.320]   What if this would only attach and detach by installing a bunch of screws and would be
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.920]   impossible to take off easily or would fall off too easily?
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920]   Or what if you made this not adjustable?
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:52.600]   So I think that there are going to be people, someone like me who travels a lot and is always
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:58.640]   wearing a sling be it, whether it's a little bag for my iPad or a 15 inch laptop bag that
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.720]   I always wanted something like this so I could adapt that into a sling.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.760]   So that's your initial response, but maybe a month or two later, you realize that I would
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.160]   be willing to pay $45 for it.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.840]   And now I, this guy who I thought would never pay me back for the dinner that he owes me
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.360]   actually gave me $60 on that basis.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:19.080]   I'm now willing to buy this because it is exactly the perfect thing.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.120]   I acknowledge it's expensive, but nonetheless, I've been using this for, I actually took it
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.640]   out to my first like actual like walk around event rather walking around the city taking
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.200]   pictures of the other weekend and man does it work nicely.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.680]   It's exactly what I wanted it to be.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:39.720]   So very pricey, you can get it from B&H Photo for like $96, but I've not seen anything quite
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.800]   like it else on the market.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.480]   SunSniperUSA.com, if you want to find out more.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   The SunSniper's...
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]   StrapS surfer.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.880]   StrapSurfer, they really need to work on that name.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.880]   Sure.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:52.880]   Messing your bag not included.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.920]   They also, they also, again, here's a lesson to you.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:59.760]   If you're going to send a press release, the price of very good thing put on the press
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.760]   release.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.760]   Oh, look at that.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:06.960]   I'm not sure if I'm looking for it, but maybe they're quick to point out that it comes with
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.560]   $500 in theft insurance.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560]   That's cool.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:12.160]   Oh, wait, I'm sorry, here it is, he had $96.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.560]   It was just very entertaining.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560]   Full date.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.560]   Maybe my brain just sort of like blocked it out.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.560]   It's like $96.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:24.040]   I don't want to soothe the cost $96.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.040]   Mr. Justin, Robert Young, you have a pick.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.040]   I do.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:34.120]   This one has been around for a while, but especially because not only am I new to the
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.840]   Bay Area, but also I've been doing a lot of traveling recently, I've really, really, really
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.840]   relied on ways.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.680]   Oh, it's so cool, isn't it?
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:46.280]   Yeah, an app for Android and iOS that is also going to be part their feeding data to
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.480]   the new Apple Maps.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.680]   But basically, here's the idea.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680]   It's a term by turn GPS.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.680]   Oh, really?
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680]   Is this where the maps data for?
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:55.720]   It's coming from a lot of places including ComTom.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720]   Okay.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:03.360]   I think what the ways has that other people don't is a social layer baked in in terms
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.080]   of reporting.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.240]   If you're using the app, you're feeding back data to their servers so they can determine
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:15.480]   how fast, fairly accurately, each route is going.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.520]   And also, there's more direct reporting where if you're in a stand-seller, you see an accident,
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.560]   you can report it and now they'll reroute you somewhere else kind of on the line.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.560]   And everybody else now.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.560]   And it's great.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.040]   It's a way to socially support your buddies.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.040]   I love it.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:36.840]   So for me, if I'm trying to get from my office in San Francisco back to my place in Oakland,
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:42.800]   I know exactly what the entrance to the Bay Bridge I should get on by that time of day,
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   depending on how backed up 80 is.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.280]   Or if I'm coming out to Petaluma, I know when there's an accident on 580 that I should
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:53.760]   be going around in these crazy farm roads, which I've done two or three times.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.760]   It's fantastic.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.960]   And a real quick story.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.760]   So I was doing a thing in Palo Alto and I'm new to this area.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:03.440]   So I'm not used to things that I use on the internet being real places, like businesses
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.800]   where that have signs and people in there that create products.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.360]   So I just have a habit, an uncanny habit of just walking in like a hayseed and just like
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.280]   talking about how much I enjoy their stuff.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.280]   So these very--
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.720]   You guys have a store.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:20.600]   No, I literally, I walked in and I was just like these very quiet, polite engineers and
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.920]   just like, "Hey man, I love your app, man.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920]   These will tell you.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.920]   They're just great.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.240]   And they were just very polite and they just were like, "Okay, thank you.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.240]   Here's what's in our new version.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.240]   Please leave.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.240]   They're scaring us."
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.240]   People never visit us.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.560]   Yeah, they're not used to visitors, but I visited them.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560]   I think they're great.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560]   Go ahead and pick it up.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.560]   It's great.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560]   This is San Francisco.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.360]   If you fire a gun in the air to show how happy you are, that's going to be taken very,
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360]   very differently than it might back home.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.360]   Exactly.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.360]   Back from Florida.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.560]   That was how you told your mom you loved her with a fire and automatic weapon.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560]   "Oh, I love you.
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.480]   Stay back."
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.040]   Waze is really, really, really cool.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.320]   I can't remember my login, but I have it on the iPhone.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.880]   It's nice because this makes perfect sense.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.880]   You've got a GPS.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:02.880]   You're driving along.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.880]   It feeds everything right back.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.920]   I will say in terms of it connecting, like I have AT&T out here.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.680]   It sometimes can be a little dodgy when it's on low.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.120]   That's another thing that we do so well in the Bay Area.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120]   AT&T.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.600]   Yes, it is horrifying AT&T service.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:24.120]   I'm a huge fan, so pick it up.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.120]   I've got a couple of things to tell you about.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.560]   First, a little plug for our friends.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:33.520]   This was a previous pick of mine, Alfred App.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.960]   It's called.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.000]   If you ever used Quicksilver, it's very similar.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.440]   In fact, when Quicksilver went away, I switched over to Alfred and I've been really happy.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:46.680]   It's one of those apps where, in my case, I press command space.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:53.280]   I guess I use alt space and I could type the first three letters of an application or a
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:58.000]   name and it will pop up or a website.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.040]   This has so many additional features that I just really love.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.760]   It really has replaced Quicksilver in my heart and they even have a power pack.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.840]   Now, this is called Alfred App.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:12.840]   You can get it on the App Store, but if you want to use the power pack, you should probably
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.160]   get it from Alfred App.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.240]   Let me tell you a little bit about something that's going on right now.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.240]   You know that we have a really great company called Cashfly that provides us with bandwidth
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.200]   for all of our shows, including Mac Break Weekly's video.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.760]   They're joining up with Alfred App for a contest just for you.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.400]   You Twitch viewers.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.240]   You 20 power pack licenses, the high end license for Alfred 1.3.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:47.720]   If you visit alfredapp.com/twit and add cashfly on Twitter, you could be in this contest.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.920]   I really am a big fan of Alfred.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920]   It's been a Mac Break Weekly.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.880]   I picked several times and I just thought this was really cool.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:59.040]   Thank you Cashfly for being a fan with for all of our shows.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:03.640]   Thank you Alfred for a great little app that everybody who uses a Mac should have.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.880]   Here's a great way you can get a power pack license or lifetime upgrades free forever.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.920]   Did you talk to you like Michael Kane?
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:13.720]   It should Alfred.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.720]   In the Batman.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.720]   There's a power pack the size of a Tangerine.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.800]   I think they are British so they probably could do that.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   How a pack?
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.000]   The size of a Tangerine.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.960]   She was only 60.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:26.960]   How?
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:33.600]   And then this one Gary Cofler sent me a link to a Cult of Mac article about something
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.600]   called Lion Tweaks.
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:40.960]   You've heard us complain over and over and over again about the skeuomorphic features
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.960]   of ICal and all that, the little stitching and all that stuff.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:52.760]   Well Lion Tweaks is a free app although if you go to their website, ifrederick.com, he
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.560]   does offer you a chance to give him a little donation which I would do.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.560]   Throw him a few dollars.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.520]   Throw him a few bucks but you can download it for free just by clicking the link.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:08.640]   Let me launch Lion Tweaks using Alfred and by the way and show you, oh I have to move
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.000]   it to my, I haven't done that yet.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.640]   Check automatically for updates.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.960]   So you can change, for instance, I complained a while ago and there is a command line to
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.720]   make the user library folder always visible.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:20.720]   You don't have to hit the object.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.000]   But you can just click here and it's done.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000]   Library is visible.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.640]   Enable the 2D dock, remove system window animation, remove with.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:34.520]   But if you go down you'll see you can get rid of some of change ICal leather to aluminum.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   Yes.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.520]   Boom.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.520]   Yes.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.960]   And then it's going to launch and install it but I won't do that.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.640]   There's a lot more little tweaks in here.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.720]   This is Lion only.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:49.280]   It is free but donations are asked for IFREDRIK.com/applications.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.000]   It's called Lion Tweaks 2.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.240]   And thank you Gary for pointing that out.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:59.200]   I think it's a really handy little tool to turn off the leather.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.400]   We do this show at 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern Time Monday through Friday.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.880]   No, not Monday through Friday.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.880]   Why did I say that?
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.240]   Just Tuesday, once a week.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:09.240]   Just once.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.240]   It lives Monday through Friday and your heart.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.240]   It lives in my heart.
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:12.240]   You take the weekends off.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.240]   All the time.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.280]   11am Pacific is 1800 UTC if you want to join in.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:20.480]   Watch us live but we make on-demand versions available after the fact on our website, twit.tv
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.080]   and everywhere find podcasts are.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.440]   And gregated anti-annocco can be found at the very nice Chicago Sun Times.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:33.000]   Justin Robert Young's in here to do NSFW show.com.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.080]   We have a new time for you, right?
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:37.080]   No.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.080]   You're on the old time.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.080]   We moved those hands away from you.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.080]   The hands?
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.960]   They went to Wednesday because they were a little confused.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.840]   But it was probably the oddest pairing.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.200]   It was not a good pairing.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.320]   Ham Nation and NSFW was pretty hilarious.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.320]   So now I think it was all about Andrew.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.640]   All about Android and NSFW and last week we actually had a fun little crossover with
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640]   all about Android.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.760]   So tonight, Tuesdays at six.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.080]   Seven Pacific times of 10 pm Eastern times.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:11.440]   Sarah Lane's on tonight and we get ever closer to releasing our big book hoax which will
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.440]   come next to you.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.440]   Stay tuned for that.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.440]   So I don't know.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.400]   It's a pretty Randy idea.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.400]   So I don't want to discuss it here on the proof.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.320]   Save it for the Randy NSFW.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.040]   Sarah is launching a new show and I hope she'll talk about it on an SFW or iPhone show.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.280]   We'll make next week.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:32.280]   I5 for the iPhone will be on Mondays and I'm very excited about that.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.280]   We'll see you next time.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   Now get back to work.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.280]   Break time is over.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:50.720]   [Music]
