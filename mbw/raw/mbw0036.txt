[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that talks all about
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Macs and nothing else but Macs.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So help us God.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Today is actually kind of the second Mac Break Weekly this week.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We did a special yesterday.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   If you haven't listened to it, please pause your recorder
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and listen to that so that you understand what the hell
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   we're talking about today.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Actually, we want to do a real show today because we didn't have
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   the full brain trust on tap.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We do this time.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Alex Lindsey is back from the pixelcore.com.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hello.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And Merlin Mann as well, Mr. Hot Dog's Ladies.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Hello.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   But we couldn't get Scott Born.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   His internet was down.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   What is that, Scott?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   You live in a third world nation?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Your internet?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   No, John DeVorak got in touch with my service provider
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and tried to screw up my ISP.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But I'm back.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I checked out our slash blog.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   If you live in a third world nation, you probably would have
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   excellent internet access.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's only us in the States.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Well, it's the free healthcare and the ISPs in Iraq that are
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   really the top notch stuff.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And also joining us in the Chicago Sun times and the colossal
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   waste of bandwidth at CWOB.com.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's Andy and NOTCO, the man in the hat.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Red Five standing by.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Blue Leader, Blue Leader.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And on target.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So let's, and by the way, we are live on a talk shoe.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   For those of you who, I think we, well, we've done it once
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   before.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I wasn't actually here for this, Alex.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You did it.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But I like talk shoe.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And I think we'll probably do this in future just to kind of
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   do some interactivity.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Plus you can listen to a live stream.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And we're going to do talk shoe, I think, for Twit,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Net at night, this, and on Thursday, we'll be doing talk shoe
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   for Windows Weekly.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So I'm slowly rolling out talk shoe throughout all of our
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   properties.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   There goes the man with budget Martha.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   For talk shoe, not for me.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It doesn't come, maybe.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That's right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And we're going to talk to Dango at some point, I hope, about
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   doing something like this, right?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, well, we'll be ready for you when that time comes.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's not quite today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So we'll go ahead and crunch what's left to talk shoe's budget.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   All right.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I think that's fine.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Dave Schulliger's going, oh my God.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Oh my God.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So he won't alert throughout the entire building.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We goes on.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They've encouraged us.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They say it's great.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We love it more, more, more.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And they do handle us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well, we don't do, you know, it's interesting.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Maybe because we're offering higher quality podcasts after the
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   fact, but not a lot of people listen to the live stream.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.360]   I mean, thousands of people could be listening now, but generally
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   choose to listen to the podcast.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Oddly.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Those people have better things to do right now than any of us
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   speaking.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Maybe that's it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I was reading something in the Wall Street Journal about this thing
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   called jobs.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They talk about that a lot in the journal.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I don't get it.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I think I'm going to.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So much of it goes way over my head, but apparently there are
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   great places and work.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So I'm giving up my journal subscription for street sheet,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   actually.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   That's a great sheet.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's funny.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You made a local joke.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's very local and apparently nobody gets it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Well, you know, I used to be the creative director over at Yank
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Magazine.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So I can get you hooked up with those guys.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Did you really?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Never mind.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's a little mind.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Did you really?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   What's going on?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   What's going on?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Is we getting mad?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Come on.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Come on.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Tell the truth.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   All right.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Well, of course, the big story we talked about yesterday, we did
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   do a 30 minute special, but we didn't get Scott and Andy's
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   opinions on this is that a big announcement.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Steve Jobs was in London on April Fool's Day with an EMI.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Actually, it was the day after April Fool's Day, but they made
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   the announcement that there was going to be an event on April
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Fool's Day.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And EMI's announced that they are going to remove copy restrictions
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   from their catalog and encoded at a higher 256 kilobit AAC and offer
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   them on iTunes for 30 cents more, 30 pence more, 30 euro pence
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   more.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And I think everybody agrees.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   This is great news.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You agree, Andy?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Is there any negative to this?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The only negative is that about the 30% of the people out there
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   who thought that Steve Jobs's letter was just some big empty
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   scam.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now I have one thing less to pitch about.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   That's what John Grubu was saying about Cory Doctorow.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He called him the jackass of the week because Cory didn't believe
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, I wouldn't comment on that.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   But the only negative that I found was that it would have been
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   really, really phenomenal if the announcement was that, well,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   look, we're just going to say that for now on it's either copy
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   protective or it's not copy protected.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It'll all be the same price.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There's not going to be a two layer pricing structure.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I'm not sure which one I would choose.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   If I had to choose between 99 cents for copy protected music
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that's at a higher bit rate or 99 cents for the same 128 case
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   samples that at the same price, excuse me, same bit rate.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, you don't have to make that choice because the high
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   quality is also on copy protected.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That format is much more betterly in my head.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I've only been awake for 11 hours yet, so I haven't had that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I've only had three cans of Coke.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   What I'm saying is that it's now there's a value added sort of
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   download and I'm not sure if it wouldn't have been cooler just
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   to simply say for 99 cents, they're not copy protected.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Right.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's still the same flat, flat rate.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Although again, I was really, really pleased that for the
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   extra 30 cents, you don't just get this, you know, sort of
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   intangible.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Oh, well, we're now we're we're uncont protected.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I can put this on my phone if ever had an interest in putting
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   this on my $8 cell phone.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You actually do get sound quality.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   This twice is good.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You agree, Scott born.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Good news.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It is good news.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And I also could with Andy, my first thought was, well, what
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   are the haters going to complain about now?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Then they immediately told me, oh, well, it's not this way in
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Europe yet.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   How's that?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Actually, the European Union complained they filed a suit almost
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   immediately after.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I don't know if it's related, but their complaint is that the
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   price is different in different countries.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Apple says, well, we wanted to have one European store.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   We don't want to have, you know, this this complicated price
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   structure either.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But the record labels forces to have individual stores and
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   large different amounts in each store.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So maybe it's the record company's fault.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Maybe it's Apple's fault, but the EU is going to ask them for
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   materials so they can investigate.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Well, I don't think I don't think Apple has any that any good
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   reason to want to have prices be different all over the world.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's way more work for them.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So I don't see how they would they would think that Apple was
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   connected to having all the this crazy price structure that
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   happens in Europe.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yeah, that's clearly coming from the regular companies.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The other response from the record companies, the other, the
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   money in my companies was, you know, we were all hoping maybe
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   they would take a cue from this and and do the same and their
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   response was over and over Steve Jobs dead body.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They don't want to go on copy protected.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I think everybody will be watching with interest to see if
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   this hurts EMI sales or helps EMI sales.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Well, the two tier pricing thing.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I just want to talk about that because a few weeks ago we were
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   talking about something and I mentioned that they could charge
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   more for something.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Everybody thought, well, no, they'll never have a two tier
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   pricing schedule.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Well, now they do.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   So does this open the door to them creating all sorts of other
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   levels of iTunes music stuff you can get at different prices?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Well, you do have to realize that again, they are giving you
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   something for the X of 30 cents.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Also, it's not as though they're certainly saying there's going
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   to be a sliding scale.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   They're just binary.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's either a buck 30 or a buck.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And what I think is and also at least they're giving is Apple's
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   selling a little bit of something back.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They also instituted a new policy where if you buy two or three
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   tracks off an album and you suddenly decide, yes, I want to
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   buy the whole album, you'll get credit for the tracks that you
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   already bought.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So I don't know.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I don't like that.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'm glad I did that.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I mean, as somebody who usually buys most of his songs all a
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   cart, now that I will also have not only get credit for buying
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   purchases online, but also we'll have the option in the future
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   hopefully of buying any music that I want unprotected.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   This might be the end of my buying physical CDs because those
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   are the two advantages that I always had in buying them in
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   forms of plastic, getting it unprotected and also getting
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   sort of a deal on buying the whole package.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   If you remove both those things, I might never head to Barnes
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   and Noble or Amazon again for music.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Is the bumping quality enough, Alex, for you to think it's a
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   good deal now?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's plenty for what I'd want to do.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The ever-commudgeonly, Ben Durbin was suggesting that it's
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   he was wondering aloud, I guess I shouldn't say he was
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   stating, but wondering whether, when we say this is double
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the bit rate, is it truly double the quality or is it on
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   some kind of a logarithmic scale?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Yeah, it's not double the quality.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   I don't even know what double the quality means.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Well, that's what everybody's saying.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I mean, I'm quoting what everyone else says.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's double the bit rate and I think they're using the double.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   What does that mean in terms of, I mean, if you're going to
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   try and quantify that in terms of better sounds?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's 10% better, 20% better.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I don't know if you'd quantify it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I don't think, first of all, it can't be twice as good because
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   it's pretty darn good to begin with.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I don't know what twice as good would mean.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   All I can say is that when I did my big rip a year and a half ago,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   finally, to sign a rip, every single CD I had, I started off by
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   trying every single different confaburation that I could
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   possibly come up with to try to figure out what format to
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   rip it all in.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And I did settle on 256 K A A C as my favorite rate in terms of
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   best quality that I could actually deck with the ears that I
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   was born with and also having the smallest files that I
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   wanted to deal with.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You could tell the difference.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I could, I found that if I went one notch higher, I could sort of
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   fool myself into thinking I could tell the difference between
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   256 and 320.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It wasn't so much of a case of there being a huge difference
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   all the way across the board between 128 and 256.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   But there's, when you're looking, when you listen to things
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   that are kind of tricky, like acoustic guitar, some symphony,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   some classical music, where you can actually really hear, you can
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   actually hear the nang of the horse that they used to be.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That they used to make the bowstring out of.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   You know, that sort of stuff, you can really hear a bit of a
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   difference.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But realize that most of this just comes out of the fact that
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   now God, a 40 gig iPod cost as much as a six pack of beer these
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   days in terms of capacity.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You like classical music, Alex, Lindsey, and I think you don't
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   like the 128 bidding encoding, as I remember.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Where you really, what's happening between 128 and 256 is
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   essentially you have a lot more, a lot more data to hold.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   What we're taking is an analog signal and we're quantifying
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   into little bits.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And there's a little stair steps there.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And you have more stair steps with the 256.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Where that's really going to show up is when you get, as Andy was
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   talking about, where you get strings, where you get something
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   really soft, where you get things that are really complex,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   or where there's just not going to be enough to describe it well.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And so you're going to start hearing the variations there.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The other thing that it's going to make a difference in is that
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   a lot of this stuff is perceptually compressed.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So what they do is they say, well, you really can't hear up there.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So we're going to throw some of that away.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And you really can't hear down here.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So we're going to throw some of that away.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And so what happens is that if you re-eq any of the stuff that
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   you're doing, when you listen to it flat, it'll sound fine.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   As soon as you start, oh, I want to bring up the high notes or
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   the bass some more.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Sometimes you can hear a lot more of what's not working in a
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   compressed thing.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And you're going to hear a lot less of that in 256.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   So I wouldn't say it's like twice as good, but in those edges
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   they're a lot finer.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And it's much closer to something that I would say, oh, well, I
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   could keep all of my stuff that way and not ever really feel like
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I need to get a better.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Something to point out, though, is that you'll have half as much
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   room on your iPod because twice as big the files.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   But they're not.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   There's so many smaller.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I haven't filled my 16 now.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   You're right.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Mindful video.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I just had to listen to three weeks worth of music at one stretch.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Right.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Hey, just some notes for our talk shoe audience.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   A couple of things.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   First of all, we will be taking calls later in the show in
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   about half an hour.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   So if you want to get in the queue, please do make sure it's a
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   question for our panel having to do with Macintosh stuff.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I also want to mention that there is some people who've never
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   used talk shoe before find the chat interface, the horizontal
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   chat interface, a little disconcerting.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   There is a standard IRC chat room as well that Eric's is set up
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   at IRC.caffeine.com.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   That's IRC.ka.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Double F E I N E N E T dot com caffeine.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   That's a very well known IRC server.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Good server.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And it's a pound.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Twit.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Pound.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Twit is a chat room if you prefer to use IRC.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   But there are plenty of people in here who are joining us.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And I see you Alex in there.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   I'm there.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And also a number seven said does this mean indie artists will be
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   able to use sell the same DRM free songs even if they aren't
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   or anything is from EMI.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I bet you that that's going to happen.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   But I don't know exactly when.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   When you think you read the announcement, you notice that I
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   think there's what what 1.25 million songs initially when this
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   rolls out with Steve saying that by the end of the year that
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   would practically double that.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Right.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Where are you going to double it from?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Right.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Well, he must have some deals that are in the works that
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   aren't really signed.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You get a real seat announcement.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I don't think he promised a doubling unless you knew that was
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   going to happen.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The other thing he made very clear is this is not going to happen
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   for video.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Did he say it was going to happen or did he just duck question?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I think people have said that they don't expect.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   He didn't say no.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I think he said no.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And I think his point was, hey, it's not an encrypted in video
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   now.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   So why would we do it later?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Maybe it was on the Apple press release or somewhere.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Not that I recall you saying that he kept coming back to the music
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and he kept coming back to the state.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   But that well CDs have never been copy protected, so we're not
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   really changing things.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And there's a reason he keeps bringing that up because he does
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   not want to unencrypt the movies.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I don't know if he's saying, oh look, my arm is thinking.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I guess the thing is I'm not sure whether he doesn't want to
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   encrypt them or whether he just doesn't want to start that
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   battle.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I mean, you know, it's one battle at a time.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Getting DRM out of the four major labels is going to take a
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   whole year and a lot of luck.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Asking them to open up everything would be much more
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   complicated.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Right.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   As Rufo points out in the chat that the EMI music videos are not
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   copy protected, but they never have been.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They're still free.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   But we're talking about TV shows and movies.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And that's not, none of this is up to Steve anyway, as is real
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   clear here with this EMI announcement.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's the announcement.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   It's the decision that the movie companies, the TV companies
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and the record companies have to make.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Right.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Others, other stories or unless I want to give you a chance to
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   talk about this, but there are other stories in the news and we
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   did talk about it a bit.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Other stories in the news.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Other stories.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   There must be some other.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Anything else?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Well, somebody made a backpack out of an SE.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   There you go.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   There.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That's a solid wallet.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   That's a cassette deck.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That's a big word.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Very exciting.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   We're kind of in the doldrums here.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   One of the reasons that we did a show, Alex Lindsey, was because
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   you were pretty sure that there'd be a new magazine.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Oh, there was a lot of chatter on the airwaves that the octo was
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   near release.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Most of us, man.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Most of us.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You know, that would figure because Leo was with me at the
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Apple Store Friday night when I picked up my Mac Pro.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I encouraged him.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I said, "Buy that quad."
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Are you being serious?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I did.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Leo was there.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We were both wearing our Twit gear and nobody recognized
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   us, which I thought was funny.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Isn't the Mac Pro at the near the very top of the do not buy under
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   any conditions list right now?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Plus, when you put an asterisk buy it, when you buy it with Leo
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   standing next to you.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Whatever you do, don't buy it with Leo next to you.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Leo is just being very, very smart.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What you do is if you want to force Apple to come up with a new
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   thing, get one of your friends to buy it.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   You can say, "Aha, he's been waiting for a year.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Now is the time to screw him over."
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   No, no, no.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Use my credit card, Scott.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So what is that site in Maryland that we use to monitor the timing
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   on purchases?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's part of one of the ones I like is from Mac Rumors.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I think it's the Mac buying guide.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I thought the iMac was the one that's most dangerous to buy
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   right now.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   It's near the top.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   If you go to buyersguide.macrumors.com.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Yeah, I remember I downloaded a widget, but I somehow lost it.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   The one that demanded you go out and buy an airport extreme.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Buy now.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Buy now.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   It's time to buy now.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It's never going to get better now, now, now.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   No, I take it back.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I stand corrected it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   So they're putting, it looks like, this is cool.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Did you see that?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   The top Leo?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   You can sort it by time ordered.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So it'll show you the near EOL items near the top.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Well, that makes sense of the iMac could be up at the top
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   because it's after all not, it's the oldest of all.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I'm saying the Mac Mini, the iMac and the Mac Pro and the LCD
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   screens, those are the three that they say are going to be
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   updated soon.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Oh, I got two 23 inch LCD screens too.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So that's just a point.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   You know what?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   You're going to be very happy.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   That's a great system.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It is.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And you know, I have a very dedicated need for it because it's
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   sitting behind my very beautiful Air 2 Audio Arts broadcast
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   console as I speak.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Oh, are you in the new studio?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'm sitting in the new studio.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   It's semi-functional.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Oh, we Scott has kindly invited us to do some of our shows
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   there.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So I think we should start doing some Mac break weeklies from
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   the stately confines of the born manner.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Let me get out of my bat cave and we'll get to record.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I'd really like to hear.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's right.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Hey Alfred.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Well, you know, here's the thing we can duplicate the studio on
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   the roof of the condo too and then watch the game.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   It's fireworks night tonight, Scott.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Yeah, that's good to know since I live eight feet from the
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Willie Mays gate.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We actually, one of the fantasies I have, Scott and I were
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   talking and we went to the ball game on Friday after a gear
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   media tech.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   By the way, great success, Alex Lindsey.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Well done on the conference.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   That was really fantastic.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Yeah, we really had a lot of fun with it.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I was, you never know how those things are going to go when
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   you do them the first time.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And I think part of it is we just got a really, really great
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   crowd of people.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   They were good, weren't they?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   They added a lot to it.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And we did Twitter there and that video will be up sometime, you
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   know, one of the other.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It's uploaded.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Actually, we stopped the uploads.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   So I can do the Skype right now.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Okay.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   All right.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So as soon as we're done with it, we'll finish it up.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's getting into the Apple TV base compression.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   We went, oh, I'll wink it ready for Apple TV in it.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And it was like a gig.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   So we're, we're, we're, we said, okay, you know, so we backed up
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and said, okay, let's make one that's smaller than that.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And so, so we're working on that right now.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Well, it's a gig an hour.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   That's pretty high quality.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah, a little, a little more high quality than I thought was
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   necessary.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   So we got it down to 500 megs.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Okay.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   All right.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And I think it should be.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   So we'll do an iPod version and Apple TV slash.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   We'll be an Apple TV version.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   We'll do it.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   We'll be an Apple TV version.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   We weren't sure whether we really, we're going to do an iPod
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   version or not.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Okay.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   We don't need to.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Yeah, I figured we got a video up.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Any old video we'll do at this point.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Anyway, Scott.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We're going to be a video out of here.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Scott and I had this fantasy.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   We were talking about the ball game of doing kind of a Friday
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   evening kind of a salah with, you know, Twitter kind of folks,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   you know, maybe in Alberta could come make drinks for everybody
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and we'd stream it live, broadcast it and make, make
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Twit be kind of more of an event.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Would you guys.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I think it'd be great.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Scott has agreed that we could use his facility.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   So that's.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I think it's, you know, sort of like playboy after dark only with
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   ugly people that use computers.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Hello there, Scott Born.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   My, you're looking great tonight.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Yes.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It'd be fun.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   We're going to have martinis.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I'll wear my, I have a smoking jacket.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It'll be great.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And a pie.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   You'd be, you'd be.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   We're going to do whatever drinks he's working on for the next
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   show and it'd be grand old thing.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And we're preparing the green room.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   John Foster's suggestion.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   We're simply going to take a piece of green eight and a half by
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   eleven paper and stick it on the door to the green room.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Thus, it's the green room.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Good.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   John, John needs to fire his writers.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   The truth is I have never yet worked in a green room that's
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   actually green.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   This is just so you know.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, that's the first thing that my new assistant asked me.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   She said, are we going to paint the green?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   No.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Green.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I said, not exactly.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Have you ever been in a green green room?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   No.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   No.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   There'll be green rooms.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I've been in a covered big coffee.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Feeding and have lots of crudite.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   What are you carrots?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Carrot sticks.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Carrot sticks.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.720]   So Office 2008 for Mac is officially in beta.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   And it's got something.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   This I don't know.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.720]   This can't be right.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   Is this an April Fool's joke?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.760]   The Escher graphics engine?
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   That's a joke, right?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.560]   I've never heard of it.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.000]   You keep climbing and climbing and climbing step by step but
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   you never get anywhere.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   You never actually fit in your articles.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.400]   Oh, let me get to the bottom of the article.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   Okay.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.360]   So it is an April Fool's joke, right?
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.120]   New to the Office 2008 for Mac Mix is My Day, a small
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.720]   standalone app which looks like a portal into entourage's
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   appointments.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.520]   That sounds good.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   My day.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520]   Part of entourage.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.520]   Where's what?
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.360]   Is there a joke somewhere here?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   He's looking for it.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   I'm looking for it.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.080]   Is it real or is it not?
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.520]   Escher sounds like a joke.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.480]   I don't know.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.360]   You're not going to say, Alex?
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   I don't know.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   I don't know.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   It looks serious.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   It's Microsoft Word.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   I don't even know.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   It doesn't get too excited about things.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   I see Microsoft Word news and I go, you know, I'm
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   not even.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   You stop reading.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   This is from APC.com, APCMag.com.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.000]   And if it's a joke, they made a joke that looked exactly like
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.760]   the alpha that I saw a couple months ago.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   Okay.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.520]   So there is an Escher.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.960]   Why would you put a graphics engine of any kind in a
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.680]   Macintosh application?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.000]   Given the fact that you've got quartz sitting there next to
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.120]   you, available at any time.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.720]   How many works so hard to remove menu bars?
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   Right.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.360]   I think they still have menu.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.520]   Oh, no, they have the tool ribbon.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.800]   It's this weird thing that it's like a progressive series of
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.760]   ribbons that keep revealing themselves based on the context
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.920]   of what you've just clicked.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   Yeah, that's how Office 2007 works for Windows.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.800]   It should call it Microsoft Chrome.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   I watched it over somebody's shoulder a couple of weeks ago on
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   Windows.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.520]   And I was just like, is there anywhere where you can type
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   letters on screen?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   Actually, it's surprisingly useful.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.280]   I have to say, I was skeptical too.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280]   Really?
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   I started using it.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.320]   And the reason is it exposes the functionality that you want
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.400]   as you're working.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   You're right.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   It's big.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   You want buttons when you're typing?
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.840]   Well, try it.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   I was skeptical too.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.000]   You asked if you used it, Andy.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   You reviewed it.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Yeah, I used it for three weeks straight as my primary word
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   processor.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.720]   And after three weeks, I still...
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.120]   Now this is maybe because I'm used to the old-fashioned,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.400]   you know, button hook way of doing things.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.360]   But I'm used to the idea of when I want to click on a feature,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.880]   the feature is right there exactly the same place.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   On the menu.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.520]   The muscle member can go and get it, right?
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   Whereas when I have buttons that keep reconfiguring themselves,
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.840]   I keep looking up at that toolbar and I'm seeing something
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.480]   that I'm not expecting to see there.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.080]   I have to readjust to figure out and put my mind into a different
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   sort of mode.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.640]   I'm in the fonts mode or I'm in the page layout mode.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.480]   It's modal, which is anti-Mac, that's for sure.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.280]   What I didn't like about the version of Mac Word that I saw
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.800]   a month and a half ago was that I'm used to...
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.360]   We're familiar with these interfaces where you click on one
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.640]   menu and then the next, next send of options modify themselves
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.160]   so that now you're only looking at font things.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.640]   You click on another font thing underneath that and the ribbon
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.120]   underneath that is now contextual based on what you just
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.640]   selected from the fonts menu.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.720]   I wasn't able to find that same sort of common sense or that same
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.640]   sort of structure in the interface that I saw a month and a half
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   ago.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.440]   It just seems as though it's not a step one, step two, step
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   three progression.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   Right.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.120]   You just seem to see that, well, now there's just so many
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.880]   buttons they can't possibly put them all in one window.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.360]   This is just a way of just only showing you eight or nine of
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.840]   them at a time.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.600]   Maybe there's a logic that I just wasn't able to tweak in the
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.640]   half hour or 45 minutes that I spent playing with it.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.520]   Well, I remember Office 2007 was like that and it got better as it
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.520]   got closer to release.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.720]   There's not something you do have to see because I could see
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.040]   something like that being useful for something like Photoshop.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.520]   Maybe I'm not trying to be, I guess I am being a bit of a
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.680]   devil's advocate.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.800]   When you're doing Word, maybe I just use Word in a really
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   perfunctory way.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.720]   But what are all the buttons that you're using in Word?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   It's the view.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.920]   For choosing fonts and stuff like that.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.440]   I have to say, I think Word 2007, this is the Vista Windows
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.000]   version, is really significant, and really great.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And same for Excel.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.160]   It really exposes stuff and makes it a lot easier to use.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.160]   It sounds like that would be handy in Excel.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.440]   I feel like in Excel I spent a lot of time playing around.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   It's very handy in Excel.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   I forget what I need.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.800]   Well, that's what this is to respond to is that there are too
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.080]   many commands in these applications now, and you can't find
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   them.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.560]   And all the research shows that most people don't even know
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   these...
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.920]   In fact, I talked to the Office interface team in our
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.760]   Windows Weekly a couple of weeks back, and they said, "All our
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.560]   research, we kept getting requests from people for features
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.120]   that have been in Office for years because nobody can find
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   them."
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.360]   What I want to know is this Mac release is going to be something
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.080]   along the lines of Vista where it's talked about for two years,
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.600]   and then it actually shows up.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   Is there a release date?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   I don't see one in this article.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   I mean, this is the first public beta.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   I believe so.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.160]   And I definitely applaud the trying to get to.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   I mean, we all remember the horror of Clippy saying, "You seem
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   to be creating a list.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.880]   Would you like me to format this as a table?"
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.440]   That was a bad idea.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.760]   Have you guys had much of a look at Entourage in this new
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.760]   edition?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760]   Is there much new in Entourage?
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.240]   Look at this My Day window, which looks kind of neat.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.280]   It's an agenda window.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.480]   It's not.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   But it's kind of interesting.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.280]   By the way, the Escher engine I'm seeing in this article is
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.280]   the...
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.120]   It's kind of the word draw, the PowerPoint.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.240]   It's the engine that does the art in PowerPoint and word, or the
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.520]   charts in Excel.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   So it's...
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.760]   I guess you have to have your own engine to do that.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.000]   I don't think Entourage is so much different, but I might be
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   wrong.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   That was a sense I got.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Excel will be considerably different.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.640]   You guys think this will be the last major Microsoft upgrade to
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.760]   that package for Max given the two years ago at the Mackerel
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.600]   Expo when they walked out the woman from Microsoft and said, "We
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   got a five-year deal."
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   Remember that?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.120]   As long as they keep selling copies, why would they ever stop?
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   It is.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   It is the number one application on Macintosh.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.000]   Well, what just struck me odd that it was just limited to five
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   years.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.320]   Why not a longer deal?
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.200]   I mean, it seemed weird that they were limiting it.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.320]   A why even put a limit on it.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   That whole thing was...
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.400]   So I think five years in advance?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.560]   That whole thing was creepy.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.360]   With Bill Gates on the big screen like Big Brother coming to
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.560]   Save Apple with his $150 million investment.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.560]   Oh, don't you start for God's sake.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.120]   Bad enough you get a made-bad made-for-TV movie that
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.920]   spread that kind of stuff.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.680]   Actually, I think they're going to want somebody from Microsoft
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.280]   around for a while because this year, of course, it was the
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.960]   singular CEO who flopped his presentation.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.440]   They always want somebody to look bad next to Steve.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.240]   Who was the woman they had two years ago with the most?
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.120]   She was unfortunate name ever, I think.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   Yeah, it was.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   I remember that.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.400]   I remember that she didn't stop just short of using eight by
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.360]   ten note cards on the stage like the singular guy.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.400]   She'd managed to raise the bar there.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   She was nearly that bad.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.480]   She was doing a report on the solar system in sixth grade
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   or something.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.400]   Yeah, she stood there and just sort of monotonously.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.760]   My name is Cameron I'm from Microsoft.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.280]   This is a good deal for us.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.080]   Good back.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.720]   I wish I could remember her name.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.680]   I think it's really hard for people who, Steve makes it
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.120]   look so natural.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.200]   And then you just realize for someone who's an executive,
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.960]   for someone who doesn't do this every day, you suddenly don't
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.360]   have feeling pressure, but there's going to be tens of
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   millions of people listening to you what you're about to say.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.200]   I know when I started radio, the first time I was on the
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.960]   other guy flip the switch and said, well, there's about a
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   hundred thousand people listening to you.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.200]   And I sat there and stared at the mic.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.520]   And then I turned it off and went to the next song.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   It took me a couple of times to get to a point where I was
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.200]   willing to actually open my mouth.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.840]   And it can be hard, especially when you don't do it very often.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.120]   It's like trying to do radio interviews for the first time
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.320]   and you're standing there side by side with Larry King.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.840]   Right.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.320]   Right.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.440]   Well, Steve Jobs made his regular appearance on Saturday
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.880]   Night Live this week.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.400]   You want to hear a little bit from Mr. Jobs?
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.160]   Earlier this week, Apple unveiled the iPhone, a groundbreaking
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.560]   mobile phone, music player, an internet device that sent
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   their stock to an all-time high.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.400]   Here to talk about it is Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.120]   I'm going to play it anyway.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.400]   It's just so funny.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.360]   Who is that, by the way, who does the Steve Jobs?
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.720]   Because he's very good.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.880]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.200]   The guy, the guy who plays drums.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.160]   I have a total brain freeze.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   It's great, though.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   Oh, that's Fred.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   Fred Armisen.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   Is that right?
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   I love him.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   How about Conan?
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.280]   Here's Conan O'Brien's iPhone commercial.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   How about that one?
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.800]   That might be a little bit more today.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.600]   I'm just trying to get via Com2Sumi.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   That's all.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.240]   Doesn't have room for any more devices.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.040]   All right, let's start over.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   Here we go.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.840]   This is the beginning.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.040]   Your life doesn't have room for any more devices.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.120]   Introducing the revolutionary new iPhone from Apple.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.520]   It's here to set you free.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   It's a camera.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.520]   It's a movie player.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:31:02.240]   A remote control, a bottle opener, an electric razor, a blow dryer, a mousetrap, it's lip gloss.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   These are all old.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.880]   These are all old.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   I don't know why they're on our list, but I couldn't resist playing them when I saw
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   them there.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.400]   But then you get to the last line after they've done all the other stuff.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.880]   But it makes a lousy phone.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   Yeah, should we play it?
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   I'll play the last.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   I'll play the end.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   Well, let's take it the better.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   And it's a prophylactic.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   Whoops.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   It's also hard to use cell phone.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   The iPhone.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   It's everything.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   Come on.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   Come on.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:35.360]   Oh, Brian, ladies and gentlemen, watch them on NBC and please don't sue us.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.280]   I can play a little bit of that.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   This is a news program.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   We're allowed.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.000]   That's called fair use, Leo.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Fair use.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.920]   We have to comment on it or else it doesn't count.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   Okay, your comments and Ian Naco, Chicago Sun Times, an accredited journalist.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   Yes.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.280]   You hear the time when Tony used to do that year 2000 stuff?
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.840]   That was really funny.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.080]   Thank you, Andy Naco.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   Chicago.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.280]   I was the eyes we've done to the T's.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.280]   That was funny.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.800]   Chicago Sun Times.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.880]   Thank you.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.120]   He's got a press pass and he's not afraid to use it.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.400]   Just call me scoops.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.640]   He does have the hat.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.320]   There are the Beatles songs, by the way.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   We're going to see those anytime soon.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.680]   Yeah, Merlin, what's up with that?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.560]   Well, according to Steve, apparently I didn't listen to the whole press conference, but
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.160]   at some point, somebody and one of the reporters asked the very same question.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   He was on everybody's mind.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.240]   Well, is EMI doing this?
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Are the Beatles included?
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.680]   And they said, no, they're not.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.400]   And somebody asked how long it was going to be till they would be or something along
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   with us lines.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.120]   And Steve said, yeah, I kind of want to know too.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.440]   So I guess they're working on it.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   It's interesting.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.760]   So are they the only major artists that's accepted from this?
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   I guess so.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.480]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.800]   The Stones for a long time, we were also on EMI.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.080]   I wouldn't do it.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.400]   They caved a while ago.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.960]   I guess they are.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   The only ones.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.880]   Yeah, we talked about this a little bit yesterday, but that would be a good thing for them to
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.160]   keep in their pocket for a theoretical--
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.640]   Strawberry Fields, Mano.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:18.000]   But to put it out in May, when there's one that launches, that would be a heck of a buzz
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.160]   if they were to do it then.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   I agree.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   I agree.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.080]   Was there any Mac news at all, or is this just going to be a rehash?
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   No, there's Mac news.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.960]   What's the-- well, OK, I got one for you.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.560]   Did you see that there's a guy who made a backpack out of a Mac SE?
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.000]   Because, you know, you make noises and stuff, but it's pretty cool.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.640]   It's an actual SE that he's made into a backpack.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.600]   And I bet that's comfortable, too, you know?
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.840]   You know who loves those?
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840]   The ladies.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.840]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   He's got a 19-year-old computer on his back.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.440]   That's certainly a way to attract women, I think.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.160]   Oh, so what is new?
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.440]   Bear Bones has updated Mailsmith.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   Still doesn't do my map, so I don't care.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.360]   I don't know if you guys have talked about this.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.800]   It's probably not a big deal to anybody on this panel, but as a guy who literally lives
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.880]   across the street from Giant Stadium, I might like to note that Apple's added Major League
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.280]   Baseball to the iTunes library.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.880]   And today is pretty much opening day everywhere, so that might be relevant to the occasional
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   listeners.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.240]   Is it just highlights or is it full games?
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.360]   I don't know the extent of what they're doing.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.960]   I think it's my understanding that they're going to allow you to get sort of like a daily
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.200]   rewind highlight of the game.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   That would be good.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   And you can get a--
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Like a monthly pass.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.600]   I think it's a dollar-99 a month or $7.99 for the whole season or every single game for
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.320]   20 bucks, so it's not expensive.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.840]   Yeah, we were actually with the San Francisco Park, you know, we were talking about this
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   on this week of Media a little bit.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   You know, I guess they put HD monitors everywhere through the entire park.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840]   That screen's nice, isn't it?
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.920]   It's got that big screen.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   It's huge.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.880]   Yeah, the big center field screen, yeah.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.640]   But we were sitting there, we called in the guy who was in charge of it because we're
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.960]   all in our 50s plus, so we're all like, "We can't read the letters."
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.320]   But it's all in software, I'm sure.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   But he was very kind.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   I mean, he didn't mock us.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.240]   And he was also about 19.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.400]   I could see it just fine from here.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   Word.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   Way couldn't.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   Let's see.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.080]   Remember during the boom, there was some .com that had-- do you remember this?
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.440]   There was a thing where you could watch a baseball game in like just a few minutes.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   They would show just the pitch, just the hit, just the catch.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.240]   And they had like the still, the baseball game, not like a few minutes.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   Do you remember that?
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   That sounds awful.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.440]   That sounds really bad because you know what you can't get with that?
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.080]   You cannot get a GiroDelly Hot Fudge Sunday with it.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.680]   Oh, you like that, didn't you there, Scott Born?
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.880]   Oh, my good googly moo, let me tell you something.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.440]   This is one of those moments in life when it was just tremendously great news that I'm
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.640]   already fat because I don't have to worry about getting fat.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.960]   So I'm looking at the-- it's from instructables.com, the guy who made the Mac Pack out.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   I think we're really stuck with this story.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.760]   I think you guys are trying to get you off of that, Leo.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.520]   Have you looked at the picture?
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   You see how roomy it is?
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   It's a Mac.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.440]   I don't think you guys-- when I say it's a Mac SC, you guys don't understand.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.200]   It's an actual computer that he's made into a backpack.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   It's very clever.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   You put the straps on it.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.960]   We understand what you're talking about.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   That's the problem.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   We want to know.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.640]   I saw the picture of this guy and I imagined-- I saw a picture a few months ago of someone
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.000]   who went to some Comic-Con dressed as one of the Chrome's silons and like the original
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.040]   TV version of "Bels and Her Glad to Gut."
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   I had a picture of that guy, seeing the picture of the deceased backpack and thinking, "What
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   a dork."
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.880]   It does make you, I guess, a bit of a target because you got to assume that the guy's a
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   computer nerd.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   A big, big, slow-moving target.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   Well, like, yeah, exactly.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.280]   He's got a computer on his back and you got to assume he might have stuff in there of
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   value.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   So he's basically kind of like an overly-laden piñata.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.240]   I'll say that it would look really cool if you were like a big black cloak over it.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.120]   It looks like you just had this huge hump.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.640]   The eye hump.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.640]   And that would be interesting.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   It's my Mac and talk.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   All right, I give up.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   I'm not going to try to contribute.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   Stodhimer's iMac.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   Oh, you know what?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.800]   Can we throw-- can we talk about the Elgato Turbo 264?
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   That's really interesting.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.080]   It's a USB key that accelerates your H.264 compression.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.520]   I don't understand how it works.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.320]   We should probably just very quickly explain what that is and why it's a good thing.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.960]   You want to get H.264 is a-- it's heavy on the processing end in terms of compressing
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   this video.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.560]   But once you've compressed it, you've got a really good-looking video that is compatible
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   with iTunes.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.200]   Is that more or less fair, Alex?
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   Yes.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   Yes, no.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   It'll be interesting.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   It takes a long time.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   It takes a long time to do it.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.240]   It's-- it-- especially, this could make a big difference if I'm on the road.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.320]   What I would notice this for most likely is that if I was on the road and my laptop is
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.800]   not particularly fast at compressing compared to my quad that I have here, and it'd be great
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.480]   to kind of bump that up when I'm trying to get stuff up online.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   So how do they get it?
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.960]   I mean, I guess there's a DSP in it.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.360]   I don't understand, though, how they must pump the video through the USB port to the
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.120]   DSP, which processes it and passes it back?
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   It sounds magical.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.240]   I mean, I don't understand how it would work.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.040]   I guess-- I actually would be here after this.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.240]   I'd really do think it's a magic.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.480]   I'm looking at Gizmodo, which has an article on it, gizmodo.com.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.920]   And yeah, it sounds like they're mentioning here in response to talking about a rumor
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:34.160]   that this would actually-- there would be some kind of onboard H.264 encoding in upcoming
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   Macs and that this is kind of a-- until or if that does happen.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   This is a way to go.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.360]   Now, Andy, as you pointed out, there is-- already, this product is already out in the US for
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   Windows.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.560]   Yeah, ADS tech already has it.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.520]   It's packaged with a DVD ripping app and a couple of other utilities.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.800]   So it's obviously something that Elgato's OV OEM.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.520]   I'm always a little bit curious when I see stuff like this because it's not like it's
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.120]   not like it's any good if you don't already have some sort of video file that needs to
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.720]   be converted.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.600]   So it only works-- it seems like it will only work incredibly well if you've already got
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.960]   a solution that will be converting DVDs into video files or if you've got something that
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.640]   will hook it up to what you're doing in iMovie.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.240]   Well, I can tell you what it'd be good for.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.480]   I mean, it's good for a dork like me who's now laden with the chore of trying to create
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480]   720p.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:31.240]   But how much faster could it be than your core duo or your core two?
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.280]   Well, I assume-- well, I don't know how they benchmark this.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.160]   But the other example I was going to give is that now people who have Apple TVs are
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.480]   increasingly going to want to get their content into a format that'll play on there.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.920]   And if this works the way they say it does, well, it won't solve the problem.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   It'll just make it faster.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.720]   I mean, just today I was ripping a whole bunch of stuff on my Intel MacBook.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.480]   And I'm getting conversion rates of about two to one.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.960]   It takes me about 30 minutes, 20 to 30 minutes to convert an hour long TV show that I've burned
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   off of.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.960]   That's faster than mine.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.360]   Yeah, and I'm not sure enough for a show.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   Yeah, really?
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   Well--
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   But yeah, it's very time consuming.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.440]   And so what I've done is I've kind of shunted it off to my little multimedia Mac, but it's
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.400]   still-- gosh, it just takes forever.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   I'd have to do a benchmark.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.040]   But Peter Walton's pointing out in our chat room that the USB is really going to be the
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   bottleneck here.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.520]   It can only go as fast as the USB-
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   Interesting point, yeah.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.520]   And now, you know, I'm not--
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.960]   No, I don't think that's the-- I think it's the compression time.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.320]   It's much more CPU intensive than it is media speed intensive.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.280]   Well, if you wanted to geek out and you wanted to really-- if this was something that's very
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   important to your workflow, would you what?
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.560]   Put a card in a MacBook?
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.560]   How would you get around in this--
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   A Pro for an advanced--
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   For a Pro for an advanced--
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.360]   Let's say for a Pro Sumer.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.040]   Let's say somebody who makes a video podcast.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.360]   How would you speed up that process?
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.400]   You know, I might use-- if I was going to-- if I want to do it on the road, this-- where
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   this key really comes in for me is I want to do it on my laptop and I want to do it on
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   the road.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   If I want to do it, you know, in the office, I'm going to use a desktop machine.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.000]   I'm going to use a couple desktop machines with compressor.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.040]   If I want to-- if I'm going to do it all day, every day, I'm by a big rack mount that does
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.480]   it basically what this little USB does, but it'll compress the H264 in real time.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.440]   You know, and so those are the ranges.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.560]   You know, the-- I think that where this really looks like it's going to come in handy, I think,
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.760]   once again, is a lot of people doing video on the road.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   I'm about to do that.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.800]   I'm about to be on the road pretty much constantly for eight weeks.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.040]   And I want to be posting lots of videos.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:34.720]   I'm going to put up my own little mini podcast and be posting videos of what's going on.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.760]   And it is slow on my laptop.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.960]   And so I'm actually really interested in this for that specific purpose.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.000]   That certainly seemed like a really big win.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.520]   My confusion was that when you look at some of the advertising for this, they seem to
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.880]   be marketing at people who have Apple TVs, and people who want to make portable versions
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.800]   of their videos for their iPod or their PSP or something like that.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.680]   And I don't know if that's more useful for-- less useful for consumers than it would be
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.560]   for people like you who, again, have to encode stuff on the fly and get it up on the internet
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   very quickly.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   Yeah, I don't really know.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.080]   I mean, I think a lot of people-- I guess they wanted to have this stuff go faster.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.320]   To me, everything is-- unless you really need it overnight or really need it immediately,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.560]   you can do it overnight.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.640]   So you stack a bunch of stuff up.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:26.360]   You can open 10 quick times and set them all up to render out through QuickTime Pro, and
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.200]   it'll just slowly churn through all 10 of them overnight.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.160]   When you get up, they'll all be sitting on your desktop.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.640]   And so you don't even need Compressor to do that kind of stuff.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.480]   And so what I'm not sure of is for a consumer, why would I need it to be done in 10 minutes?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.520]   Because you want to watch the thing you got off a P2P on your Apple TV.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.520]   There you go.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520]   Theoretically.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.320]   I guess I just do it.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.000]   Again, it comes down to, do you want to spend $100?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.400]   Do you want to have another damn thing?
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.840]   You have to find, get out of your desk drawer and plug in just to save yourself 10 or 50
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   minutes.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   I should mention that I'm sorry.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.280]   When I'm telling you that I'm getting two to one compression times, I'm not ripping
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.680]   into H.264 only because it takes so damn long to convert into H.264.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.160]   So that's probably why there was that.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.200]   Maybe to end this incredibly boring discussion.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.360]   Do you need to do H.264 to get it into Apple TV?
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   Is that required?
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   No.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.760]   Oh, that stuff is just MP4.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   MP4 H.264.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   I think those are the four minutes.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.400]   H.264 is MP4.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.960]   It's a form of MP4.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   Right.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.120]   And it's one of the methods for printing.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   It's pretty.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   It looks good.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   It does look good.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   And it gets small files.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.760]   I have a good looking video.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.760]   It's very efficient.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.560]   You'll get a much smaller file for the quality that you can get.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.920]   I mean, you can get a lot of things.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.160]   Peter Walton on the talk she was talking about on two, which on two does a gorgeous
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:55.800]   video, but it's not, it's not, you know, it's, well, tends to be a lot bigger than H.264
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.280]   for the same quality.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   That's the issue.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.960]   We're going to go to the phones in just a moment.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.360]   If you have a question, there aren't too many people who want to talk.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.080]   So I don't blame them, frankly.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.720]   But if you have a question, call in on your talk shoe device.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   I don't know how it works.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.800]   I've never done it, but I'm sure you can ask somebody that tell you.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.320]   Meanwhile, let's take a look at our Mac picks of the week.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.400]   I don't know if you had prepared one for us, Andy, and not co, if not, you can get a
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.640]   buy.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:31.200]   I do indeed because I am in that contentable situation where I have a 120 meg hard, a
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.000]   120 gig hard drive for my power book, and I somehow seem to be down to my last 900 megabytes.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.680]   That's not good on OS 10.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   That's really not bad.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.240]   You wind up clicking OK to a lot of very angry dialogue boxes from the operating system.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:51.760]   And so the go to utility for this is from Omni Group, a utility called Omni Disc Sweeper,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.360]   where you, it's a free download.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.680]   You give them 15 bucks.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.440]   They unlock a couple extra features, but it does the really important thing for free,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.920]   which is to simply go through your entire hard drives top to bottom soup to nuts and
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   just simply list.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.240]   Here's where all the, here's where all the big folders are, all the big files are.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.800]   If you need to some, if you need to figure out, well, geez, I don't really think I filled
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.840]   this up with 120 gigabytes of data, this utility will quickly let you find that.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.600]   Oh, remember that iMovie project that I did like eight months ago and is now eating up
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.920]   32 gigabytes of my space I totally forgot about.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   There it is.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   It's right.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   It's right there at the top of the list.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.080]   And you just simply click on that, delete it and suddenly you have your hard drives
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.080]   to space back.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.480]   It's the easiest tool for getting a really good overview of what's on your drive, what's
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.680]   choking it off.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.880]   And to quickly find, oh, look, I've got the same folder, reproduce three different times.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.440]   You can easily zero in and free up space that you don't need.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.360]   And this is from the Omni Group.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.440]   This is from Omni Group.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.080]   If you go down to, I believe it's omnigroup.com.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   Omni Group.com.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.600]   Yes, there certainly is.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.680]   If you pay the 15 bucks, it activates.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.400]   As far as I can tell, the only big feature you get is an activated delete button at the
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.840]   bottom of the window so you don't have to go into the finder, to manual delete stuff.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.160]   That's the 15 bucks for you.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.320]   I like the price.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   It's $14.92.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.320]   Yes.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.840]   Obviously an Italian somewhere in the development team.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   Right.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.520]   There's another, I kept giving an alternative to my wonderful friends at Omni Group.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.480]   There's also a free app out there that a lot of people like called What Size, One Word,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.920]   which does all that for free.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.200]   And it's a universal binary.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.080]   Same thing, really?
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.360]   It's really functionally very similar to my knowledge.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   Interesting.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   But I love Omni Group.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   Yeah, we love them.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   Yeah, they're good people.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   Good people.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   Mighty fine.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   Mighty fine people.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   All right, Scott Bourne.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.000]   You got a freebie for us or maybe something highly expensive?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.040]   This is a zero Alex.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   Zero.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.080]   Zero Alex.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.720]   And it's pretty much on every Macintosh in the universe.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.040]   It's called Graphic Converter.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.320]   A lot of people don't know the habit if they already haven't.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.600]   And if they don't have it, they can download it.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   And it's free in terms of demo mode.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.240]   I think, does it still come on all Macs or is that not the case?
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.720]   I think it used to.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.840]   I don't know that it does now, but I know it's only 30 bucks to register it.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   I register it.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.360]   I register it because I use it almost every day.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   And by the way, it does support the Intel Macs now.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.520]   Oh, then I have to upgrade because the last time I got it's from Lemke's Soft.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.600]   And last one I got was a PowerPC only.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.960]   L E M K E S O F T dot com.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.480]   And you can do a lot of stuff with this.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.040]   You know, a lot of times you might open up Photoshop when really all you need is the
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.720]   twain interface for your scanner.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   Right.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.720]   Or maybe you just want to do a quick slide show or what I use it for a lot is batch conversion.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.840]   I would write droplets or actions in Photoshop to convert a bunch of images and then go get
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.280]   a cup of coffee, but you don't need to load up that huge ram gobbling program from Adobe.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.800]   You can just open this little puppy and do your batch conversion.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   Works with Apple script.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.160]   If you're a real wizard at that, you can make it do all kinds of cool things.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.280]   And it does have basic color management, even has ICC profiles.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.760]   A lot of the stuff that you might use in Photoshop, you can use this $30 program for.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.760]   I don't know.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.360]   Since the new version of Photoshop came out the other day, what is it?
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.680]   1.5 million dollars now for the entire suite.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.280]   More than an Alex, I think.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.960]   I just thought I'd remind everybody, you probably got a copy of Graphic Converter on
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   your Mac.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.360]   If you don't, you can download it for free from LemkeSoft.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.200]   And if you work with images, you might want to try it.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   I agree.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.600]   I think it's really a useful tool, even when it was not universal.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.640]   Now that it's universal, I'm downloading it right now to upgrade.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.040]   Hey, anybody here have taken delivery on CS3 yet?
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   Are we still in beta?
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.480]   I had to mortgage my house first.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.840]   It's a lot cheap to get the whole thing, but you don't have to buy everything, right?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.240]   The creative suite.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   Can you just buy Photoshop?
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.400]   Photoshop's still like $700, right?
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.800]   I think it does have stock in BitTorrent or something.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.160]   That's why they got the pricing structure.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.560]   They want to put, they want people to get it from BitTorrent.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.040]   So yeah, I'm going to get Photoshop.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.200]   There hasn't been a new feature in Illustrator that I personally want to, since six, you know,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.000]   I mean, there's like two or three, like layers, I guess, would be the one thing.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.560]   But, you know, I get, I find Illustrator to be vexing.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.120]   I just did a big tracing for some of some stuff.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.160]   And, you know, I had to trace out a whole thing and it just made me, made me insane.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.560]   So, so I'm, I'm, I'm definitely moving, obviously to Photoshop CS, but I don't think I'm going
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.320]   to get the whole bundle right now.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.480]   I still have that cracked bait.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.880]   I mean, I, I'm sure I'll have a great.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   Sometimes.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   Sometimes.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:40.400]   The upgrade for the creative suite three design premium upgrade, 440 bucks, full $1799.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.000]   Oh, a lot of dobeys.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Oh, baby.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And I paid for my first car.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.360]   Well, that was in 1902 dollars.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.080]   It was a lot.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.640]   I found we on the daily giz was we found a cost of CPI calculator from the Federal Reserve
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Bank of Minneapolis that tell you enter a year and you enter the amount and it tells you
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.400]   what it's what it was, what it was be worth in today's dollars.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.360]   And believe me, a $1700 car in, in whatever you bought at 1968 or whatever.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:16.560]   No, actually that's, that's three times where I bought, I paid $500 for pretty sweet, uh,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.560]   55 Chevy hot and that's back.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.840]   That's like we're on the gold standard, right?
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   He used Confederate dollars for that.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.120]   So the web version is 1599, but I guess gas was only 25 cents a gallon.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   That's right.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   That's right.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   And everybody had a.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.120]   Give me a disc.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   It was simple time.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.120]   Jesus.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   And we had our own food.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.760]   Yeah, we did.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.440]   So you can buy and Andy's and Andy's sidebirds were only down to just below his ear.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440]   Me how to.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.800]   My sideburns were in style back then.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.440]   That's how long ago it was.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   Photo shop.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:53.520]   Because factory tailor look Photoshop full by itself is a thousand dollars.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   That's crazy.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   That's the extended.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   What?
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520]   Right.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   Oh, extended.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   Okay.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   So just standard, I think is less expensive.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.520]   I don't see a standard.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.120]   First of all, you need a physics major to figure out which version you need.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.120]   Wow.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.520]   I think they just gone crazy.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.320]   They're configurations of.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.520]   I mean, I think.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.000]   Is the actual app substantially different?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.880]   No, between the basic and the advanced.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   I can look this up.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   So let's sort of.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Here's the thing.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.280]   Here's the thing between the basic and advanced.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.120]   There's a lot of us that used to be doing.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.840]   We would do visual effects in Adobe would like of the vast majority of photoshop user
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.280]   photographers and 2D designers.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.440]   And there'd be a handful of us that were doing video.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.360]   A big enough to pay attention to.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.520]   But there'd be a handful of us that were doing visual effects and video.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.400]   And we would complain that no one gives us any features.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.000]   So essentially what I think Adobe's done is said, "Okay, here's the deal.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.640]   We'll give you the features, but you're going to have to pay an extra $2 to have them
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.000]   because you're a small subset of our user group."
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   And so we're getting some of the stuff that we want.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.040]   We're getting 3D models in Photoshop.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.960]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.680]   And we're doing a lot of other things.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.480]   So we don't need extended unless we're doing video.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.120]   If you're doing video, the only reason you would need to extend it is if you're doing
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.640]   video or you want to add 3D.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.840]   And here's why 3D is interesting for a lot of people is that I think that with Photoshop
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.360]   embracing this, I think what you're going to see is a lot more people building 3D clip
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.920]   art that is photorealistic.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.720]   So that basically if you want to add a phone to an ad to a print ad, you could import it.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.600]   And you can rotate it around into the right place and then hit render and it'll just drop
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.720]   it into the frame.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.560]   So there are reasons to have 3D.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:37.120]   If you're only doing 2D, there are reasons to have that 3D to be able to add that.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.800]   But for most people, I think that the regular one is probably fine.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.400]   So the price on Photoshop 3 is $649 if you don't get the extended.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.640]   And you know, it's only $200 to upgrade.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.080]   And most people will be upgrading, right?
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.000]   I mean, how many people buy their first Photoshop?
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.640]   Even if you do, boy, must be great.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.800]   Just that beginning, that first copy.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   Oh, there's nothing like it.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.000]   The saving grace is they're putting a lot of features into Photoshop elements.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Right.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   For most people, yeah.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   For most people, yeah.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.440]   For most people, most people want Photoshop 4.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.640]   If you want to make money with it, then you need to start to pay full whack and finance
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   this thing.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   But who uses fireworks?
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.080]   Is that still a viable program?
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.760]   They still sell it.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.120]   Back in the day, it was, well, back in the day, back before the standards-based design,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.440]   when we cut up our pages by hand, you basically, if you were a half-assed web designer, you
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   had two choices.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:32.320]   You could either do Dreamweaver and fireworks, or you could do, well, at least call it GoLive,
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.840]   whatever it became, and ImageReady.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.720]   And so you could basically, it was really cool at the time because you could give it
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.200]   to the admin and they could just go change the buttons by opening up in fireworks and
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   saving as, you know, and it was nice and easy.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.040]   I don't know if anybody still uses fireworks.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.920]   You know, just as a funny little orthogonal point, these applications we're talking about,
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.080]   these like, you know, illustrator and stuff like that.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   Illustrator is great.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.760]   Like when we had to trace the line art for the graphics on my show, Illustrator was awesome,
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   worked great.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.120]   But we've talked about this a little bit before.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.720]   I mean, I think it's so funny the way that as much as this technology evolves and gets
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.880]   more sophisticated, you know, I find myself doing stuff like, well, stuff I would have
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.400]   done an illustrator, you know, eight years ago, I now do an Omni-Graftful.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.200]   Because it's just so easy.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   You just open up the--
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.840]   It's so like, again, let's plug for my friends at an Omni-Graftful.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   Who do great work.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.960]   Yeah, Omni-Graftful Pro is out of control.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.360]   It's got a built-in outliner.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.440]   So you can do mind maps inside of there.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.440]   People don't know this is in the Pro version.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.760]   But you know, if I just want to draw a square and put some text in it and have it be a
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   vector, I'll do that.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.200]   And then there's another application that everybody's got that comes with, at least
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   it used to come with a lot of stuff.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.040]   I think Scott's on to something with his graphic converter stuff though, because I mean,
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   you think about it.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.240]   Everybody uses a different three or four items inside of Photoshop.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:53.440]   You might be surprised to know that, you know, Gaussian blur and Unsharp Mask and Layers.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.040]   It's out there in apps that are not as costly as this.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.600]   The GIMP now is native on Mac and does a lot of that.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   How does that run?
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   How do you--
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   Does that run pretty well?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   No, it makes me crazy.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.360]   Is it the user interface or is it on the run?
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   Yeah, it's just clunky.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:11.320]   Okay, the GIMP shop, it looks just like your Photoshop.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   It just feels clunky.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.560]   You know, when you're working it, and I have to admit, Photoshop has got a big R&D budget
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.320]   and all that stuff, but it just-- it feels a little rough.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   Hey, it's free.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   I know, I know.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   Yeah, but I mean, there's no creative problem inside of that.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.720]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   No, that's it.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.720]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.640]   I was going to say there's no creative problem in the design of that user interface.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.040]   For instance, the solution was not, well, we'll just put another button up there.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.600]   We'll just put another tool pal up there.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   Right, that's true.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.200]   I haven't used it for a year and a half when I desperately needed it.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.960]   I didn't have Photoshop on this brand new laptop that I had.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.920]   And so I just downloaded the GIMP, ordered my Amtrak train.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.280]   I had four and a half hours to do some very simple cutting and pasting.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.520]   And by hour two, I had sort of figured out how to do what I had figured out in three
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.640]   seconds and MacPaint 1.0.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.680]   It was just, oh, good heavens.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.160]   The portrait of the plane was on speed.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.640]   The power, I mean, like the kind of subtext to all of this that I think is still true is
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.240]   if it's important to you to have a Microsoft shop where all your stuff works together,
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240]   then that does help.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.560]   Ditto for a Adobe, a Ditto for whatever it is that you're using.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.040]   I mean, if you've got a suite of tools that work well together and your team and your workflow,
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.160]   then that's worth every nickel, you know?
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.960]   And some people are really taking advantage of the ways in which all of these things work
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.960]   together.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.880]   I think one thing that's interesting is there's so many cocoa applications that have this sort
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.600]   of stuff that's kind of emerging at this higher level, things that you can do through
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.320]   services that will allow you to work applications together.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.720]   So I don't know.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.920]   It's worth the money if you got the money, I guess.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.440]   Alex Lindsay, we need a pick from you, my friend.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.960]   Okay, so I have a pick, but it's a zero, Alex.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.360]   You know, it's zero, Alex.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.120]   And I have to say this is it's a web.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.360]   It's a web app, actually.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.880]   It's not a it's not a it works on the Mac.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:59.480]   And I have to admit that I hesitate to tell people about this because it has taken so
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.960]   much of my weekend this last weekend.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.360]   So I'll tell people what it is, but I just have to warn you.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.960]   It's a worse and sketch fighter, which wasted my weekend.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.960]   All right.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.760]   You didn't have to download it.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.760]   Download it.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:14.760]   I paid for it.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:22.000]   Yeah, this is this is just a stupid little web a web app called desktop tower defense.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.400]   Have you guys seen this?
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.760]   I'm downloading it right now.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   Desktop.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.600]   I've been reading about the addiction.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   Everybody's a talking.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.600]   Oh my gosh.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   It is.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   Okay, so what it is.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.360]   It's the stupidest little game.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:34.520]   It's a hand run game.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.520]   It's not a hand run game.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.320]   And make sure I get the right desktop tower defense.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   Yeah, it's working.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.840]   Oh, I've been playing this.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.840]   Oh my gosh.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.840]   It's on my tumbelog.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.040]   Oh, I just oh no, I play a different one from the same group.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.120]   Yeah, they do a world of Warcraft kind of thing.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.920]   Oh, this is.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.320]   So what happened is you put these little these little guys have to run from one side of the
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.480]   screen to the other and you get to put like little guns and turrets and and missile things
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.520]   and everything to try to stop them.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.000]   And it's one of those things like I thought, oh, this is kind of cute.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.920]   And then literally on Sunday I lost like four and a half hours.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:17.160]   I mean, it was just my mind just became completely set on this because you get to a point where
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.800]   you suddenly think that you're just around the corner from breaking through and then
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   you just keep on playing it.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.160]   That's what gets you to gambling.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.960]   Yeah, no, no, it is totally.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   Okay, so you get these little defensive towers, bash, frost, swarm, dart, squirt.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.560]   That's where to start in my opinion is to start with the pellet towers.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   Okay.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.260]   So you start the pellet towers and you and you block off the entrance with the pellet
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.360]   towers because the little guys are coming out first.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.880]   I have to wear them right now.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.880]   Okay.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.880]   So you can't block them completely off.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.120]   They have to have somewhere to go.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   Right.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   So I'm okay.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   Let me press start.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   Here they come.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   All right.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.120]   Now, so these things are going to shoot at them.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   Yep.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.120]   See, I'm getting killed.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   Cool.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   Okay.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   So they're so they're you know, those sound effects.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.360]   We're using a dark tower.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.200]   What are you using?
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.960]   That's the pellet tower, but I have a go.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   Oh, they're getting through.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   Oh, oh, we got them.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   Wait, but one more.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.960]   Get them, get them, get them.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, millions of people too did listening to Leo the poor video game.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.360]   Those voices do the video game radio.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   Those.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   You know, the quizzes.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.280]   We never could figure out how to do video games on TV.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.280]   That was the problem.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.880]   We should do them on radio.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Riveting.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:41.160]   Meanwhile, Leo presses the A button while simultaneously pushing out towards the tree.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   Here they come.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   They're coming.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   They're coming.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.160]   No.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.160]   No.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.920]   The sound effects sound a little familiar.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.560]   They sound like they sound like somebody just talking into into a mic and then playing
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   with them a little bit.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.000]   No, it sounds like an ambrosia software game or something.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.800]   I've heard those sound effects before.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.080]   Anyway, this is good.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   This is good.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   I like this.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   It's frighteningly addicting.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.920]   I have something in my tumble log that you might want to try tumble tumble.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.720]   No, no, I don't want to try any other one.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720]   Yeah, you might like this.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   It's kind of man.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.240]   Just say just walk away.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   This was, I don't.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.840]   We always talk about age.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.640]   You're going to always talk about I don't play games, not because it's not because I
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.640]   don't like games.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.080]   It's because I like them too much.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.000]   This is kind of based on World of Warcraft.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.680]   You know how you get invaders.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.160]   You also have place towers.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   I think it's the same people.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.040]   And then they call them creeps and they still come in, but they're going through kind of
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.440]   a maze and you're trying to keep them from getting all the way through the maze.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.080]   I think it's a very similar idea here with the first level is sheep.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.520]   They only have 10 hit points.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.880]   Anyway, I think it's the same people doing this frankly.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.520]   I would be surprised.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.360]   It's a fun game as I said.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.520]   It's a little dangerous.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.800]   You know, it's a it's desktop tower defense.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   A Google.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   Yeah, it's a good story.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   And it's very.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.080]   Merlin, I hope you're going to forgive me because I'm going to do a GTD application.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.000]   Oh, well means.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   It's free.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Hey, what's GT?
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.720]   We're free for free.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   Goat.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.920]   That's some kind of computer thing.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.240]   Goat tower defense.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240]   It's a new game.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.240]   No, it's out there.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.920]   It's getting things done.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.720]   And as you know, everybody knows it.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.880]   Merlin's Fold at 43 folders.com is kind of the headquarters for GTD for geeks.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.360]   And I've been looking for a good Mac application.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.800]   And you know, there's you use kinkless, I think, which is based on Omni's outliner.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   I've tried them all.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   This is this is good.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.920]   This is free.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.960]   It is from it's from a Polish guy or couple of guys.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960]   I can't figure it out.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.480]   There's two names.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:03.040]   It's bargiel.home.pl and the page is Bartek Bargiel.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.400]   But I'm fine with Google I GTD.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.280]   Yeah, yeah, you'll find it right away.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.440]   You'll find it right away.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.520]   It is in English except for the rest of the site is in Polish.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.520]   But this does a this does a great job.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.040]   I think it's pretty close to the GTD spirit.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.840]   It's got the inbox very easy processing.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.120]   It's even got a process review button has some nice features when you press the sync
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.400]   button, it'll sync with ICal.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.120]   And because I have my ICal syncing across computers, it syncs with other computers even.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.880]   So I run it on all my systems now and I have a common set of activities that I need to
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.920]   or actions I need to do.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.280]   I think this I would be very curious to what you think of this Merlin because it seems
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:46.480]   to me to be pretty, you know, it's brand new and it seems pretty close to the perfect implementation
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.320]   of this, I think.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.080]   Well, first of all, I mean, to be honest, I've kind of stayed out of the recent.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.520]   As much as I've been interested to see the development of an application that helps people
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.240]   do GTD for the Mac, I've kind of wanted to stay out of this because it's just been there's
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.720]   been a rash of these applications coming out and some of them are a lot better than others.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.320]   And a lot of them which have all some of these have a lot of work in them go way far out
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.040]   of their way to try and emulate kind of graphically how GTD works.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   Right.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.760]   They do a pretty as a job with it to be honest.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.000]   This is one of the first applications I've seen come along that I think is really usable
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.800]   for actually implementing GTD.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.520]   And the reason it works is it has affordances that keep things simple without trying to do
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.000]   too much for you.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.120]   So I mean, the problem, the way that most GTD apps go wrong is that they try to automate
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.440]   all this stuff that you can't automate.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.840]   No, no, no, this doesn't do that.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.200]   And that's the problem I had with Kingclus was trying to get the next action thing working
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.440]   and I just think this is a little bit, you know, it's pretty, it's a pretty low fi solution.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.480]   But you point out something I like a lot, which it's worth mentioning.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.760]   This has Quicksilver integration, which to me is, you know, it has to start with.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   I'm two keys away.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   I just.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   Exactly.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.560]   So you're typing anywhere you go and this goes into an inbox, just inbox, inbox, inbox.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.640]   And then when you're ready to process, you go in there, you select all the stuff in your
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.720]   inbox and hit the process review button.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.440]   And at one screen at a time walks you through this.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.080]   Also though, you can with Quicksilver, silver, if you know where you're going to, the context
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.480]   you're going to put this into, you can begin with a context command.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   I didn't see that.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.720]   Oh, yeah, it'll put it in the right context.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   And you can do projects.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.720]   If you put them in the project name and brackets, it'll do that.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.720]   And you can add notes.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.040]   So you can with one Quicksilver command do quite a bit.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.080]   It's something I count on with Kinkles.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.040]   But, you know, there's another app out there.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.880]   There's two other apps that are worth mentioning.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.040]   There's one called Thinking Rock that's really conceptually well done.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.120]   It's done in, I believe it's done in Java and to my mind, it really feels like it's done
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.120]   in Java.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.280]   So, but it's, it gets, it really gets to the heart of the GTD process like no other because
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.760]   it actually walks you through a task at a time and walks you through the workflow.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.080]   I find it a little heavy, but if you're just getting started, that's really good.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.840]   And then another one a lot of people like now is action-tastic.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.440]   I think this is very close in spirit to what action-tastic does.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.320]   But I personally, I think the implementation on I GTD is stronger.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   I'm pretty impressed.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320]   I have to say.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.480]   And it's, but the thing is it's doable, right?
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   Like all these...
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   It gets out of the way.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.800]   Yeah, so many of these applications are much more interested in looking like GTD rather
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.400]   than trying to make something that's functionally very streamlined.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   Right.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.000]   And yeah, anyway, I didn't mean to take over here.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.760]   No, no, no, because this is your feeling.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.320]   I'm actually a little embarrassed to be bringing it up, but I've been using it for about four
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   days now and actually...
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320]   It's kind of nice.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.520]   I opened it up and I was like, "Wow, this is a really an application.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.000]   It's got ad hoc tagging.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.600]   It's got autocomplete for when you want to type in emails and stuff."
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.240]   It's got a lot of nice little touches.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.840]   I think some of the UI could use a little bit of ironing out.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.760]   I think it's confusing sometimes when a tab means you're changing modes versus when it
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.520]   means you're assigning the settings.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.000]   One thing you'll like, look at the keystroke help because everything can be done with key
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   strokes.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.680]   Yeah, I noticed that in the menu.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.680]   That's the pulldown menu.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.680]   I think it's a great look.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.720]   Do you get a sense of what this is going to cost?
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   It's free.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   Free as in free.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   Free, free, free.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   Wow.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   Good job.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.040]   They call it donation wear.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.240]   How's the syncing working for you?
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.240]   It works well.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.440]   I keep duplicating my inbox because I have inboxes on all my computers.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.800]   That may be a flaw in the way it works, but otherwise it works fine.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.960]   All the key stuff that I want is working fine.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   I just have any...
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   That is nice.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   Isn't it to be able to get around like that?
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.480]   All the tasks I entered at home are now here at work.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.760]   But that's because I have a .Mac and I'm doing ICal syncing and it syncs with ICal locally.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.920]   So it's using the C2.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   Oh, I see why.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.240]   It's not syncing with itself.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.680]   It's syncing through ICal, but that seems to work.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.000]   So anyway, I haven't used those yet, but if you've got things where you're...
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.320]   And someday maybe.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.480]   It seems to have a pretty complete implementation.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   But anyway, I did actually want to ask you what you thought because...
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.880]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   I'd actually...
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.000]   I've been thinking about writing it up because I think it's as these apps go.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I think it's pretty strong.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   It's free worth trying.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.200]   What's your pick of the week, Marlon Mann?
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:08.080]   Well, I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's a guy who's made a backpack
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.360]   out of a Mac SE.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.880]   My pick is not a Mac SE backpack.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:20.800]   I love a program called VLC, which is available at videoland.org, and it's an open source
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.440]   video viewing program that will pretty much run anything right out of the box.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.560]   It's what everybody I know uses to watch any kind of movies on their Mac that are in a
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.840]   digital format.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.120]   What's cool is that there's a new...
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.320]   There's not new, but there's a widget that will let you...
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.640]   A widget for Dashboard.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:46.120]   It will let you run VLC on a different Mac on your network.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:51.440]   The computer, the old 17-inch, my storied 17-inch powerbook that I use as a media server, can
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.400]   be running a movie showing VLC, and then back on my MacBook Pro on the other side of the
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:01.600]   room, I can be controlling Stop, Pause, Forward, Back from a Dashboard widget.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.600]   Very cool.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600]   It's cool.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.800]   I think they're both free and free.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   Yes, yes.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   They're...
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.160]   It's not very sexy, but it's...
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:14.560]   If you don't have a remote, this 17-inch preceded the era of the remote, it's very handy.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.360]   Created by little French schoolboys, actually.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   So it's kind of neat.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   Really?
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   Oh, a little Petite-Ecolier.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.120]   Yeah, little chocolate schoolboys.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.080]   Little French chocolate boys.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   No, I think if you go to a videoland.org where the VLC is...
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.880]   It's the A-cold or something.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   Oh.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   Maybe Insure.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.280]   Maybe Insure.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   Let's take some calls.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   You want to try them?
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.960]   It's just we're on TalkShoe.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.640]   We only have three, which is just about as much time as we have, so we're going to go
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.360]   through some calls here.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.880]   See what our TalkShoe listeners have to say, starting with...
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.600]   Geek Impact.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.840]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.840]   Hello Geek Impact.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   Okay.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.040]   Yeah, this is working well.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   Impact.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.840]   Going out to make a backtrack in Mac SE.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   Paulius, who is in Montreal.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.200]   Hello, Paulius.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.800]   Two for two, Leo.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   No, he's there.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   I hear him.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   Hey.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   Hey, Paulius.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   There you go.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   Hey, I have a pick of the week, Leo.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   Oh, good.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.280]   You know, that's the other thing is you guys can do picks of the week too, absolutely.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.240]   It's, you know, it's a bit slightly higher than he's zero Alex, but I think it's still
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   worth mentioning.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   Okay.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   It's called X-Limmer.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.840]   So you know how Mac's right now, they're using universal binaries?
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.720]   This program, what it does, it takes these universal binaries and changes them to only
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.560]   one for one processor base.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.360]   So if you have an Intel Mac, it's going to take your binaries and slim them down.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.960]   Tell me, Intel compatible.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.840]   This is kind of like what you were talking about a while ago, Scott, the one that takes
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.040]   the languages out only.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.760]   This just takes extra binaries out.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   That's cool.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.800]   It's not free and I wish it were.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.160]   Yeah, it's 12 bucks, but I think it's still worth it.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   It does the job.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   So you've been using it, Paul.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.640]   I was very nervous about using it, to be honest with you.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   So you have had.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   It worked.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.280]   It worked fantastically.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.640]   And what I like is that it makes applications smaller, so it loads faster.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.520]   I think I've seen a bit of better performance on loading times.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520]   Very good.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520]   Well, thank you, Paul.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   So I'm glad you joined us.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   No problem.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   It's nice to have you here.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   Paul is kind of a regular in talk.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.000]   Are you here all the time?
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.800]   Not all the time, Lee.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.160]   I'm just, I'm just stalking you and seeing whatever you're on.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.400]   Oh, that's why it seems like you're always on, because you're always on when I'm on.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   All right.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   Thanks, Paul.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   You're great.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   Take care.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400]   Really appreciate it.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.280]   Still in Canada, we've got Michael on the line from Toronto.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   Michael, welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.280]   Hey, Leo.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   Hey, Michael.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.840]   Sorry about leaving you hanging on at a night the other night, my computer crash.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   That's fine.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   That happens.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.760]   And that's one of the kind of the necessary evils of this kind of system is it's all, it's
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.360]   all kind of predicated on computer technology.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.280]   I'm going to talk radio.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.000]   What can we do for you?
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.080]   I just had a question for Alec who just finished listening to the tweet from DMC.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:14.800]   And I was wondering what Alec thought about the new premiere pro versus Final Cut and
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.200]   what did he say?
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.800]   Did you not get in your two cents worth when we were talking about premiere pro?
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   No, no, I didn't.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.200]   I just let Patrick say what he's going to say.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.560]   He was saying that he thought it was pretty well.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.040]   Just he said he hated it and then he said it was great.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040]   So I was confused.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   I was confusing.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.960]   No, I think he said in the past he's really hated premiere.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.680]   And I think most of our experience, most people who've gotten into video who got into video
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.400]   a decade or more ago had some painful experience with premiere.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.960]   I mean, all of us were using premiere.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.600]   I mean, that was what you use if you didn't have an avid and it was painful and it got
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.320]   rewritten and in premiere pro and it is significantly better.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.880]   I will say it's definitely a lot better than what it used to be.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.080]   And I think it's I'm excited that it exists because I think that I'm excited when Apple
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.640]   gets pushed a little bit from what they have.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.600]   The integration between the Adobe apps is getting a lot better.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.480]   For us, I mean, overall, you can't.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.200]   It's not like a bunch of people this year are going to go, "Oh, look at premiere and
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.040]   they're all going to switch from Final Cut to premiere."
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.000]   Because Final Cut, while all of us have complaints, it's really not that bad.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.120]   I mean, it does everything fairly well.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.000]   I think that what will happen though is there's a trajectory.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.040]   So if premiere keeps on showing really, really great new features and Final Cut doesn't keep
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.480]   up, then you start to see some erosion of the user base.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   I think it's hard for us to make too many decisions about the Final Cut Pro Studio compared
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.560]   to the Adobe one because Adobe just has announced a lot of what's going on there.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.040]   I think they've asked some of it.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.320]   And we're right before NAB.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.520]   So we have to wait for another couple of weeks to see if Apple reacts.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.160]   Not reacts, but we're hoping to see.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.360]   Generally, when we see a new Final Cut Pro is when we get to NAB.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:06.680]   So if something comes out in a couple of weeks, then it'll be easier to compare.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.880]   It'll be closer to Apple than Apple's, a new version of each.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.360]   And if not, then we'll be able to make that comparison.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.440]   But I think that for us, the big thing is as we do production and we do, we have to worry
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:26.200]   about tens, 30, 40, 50 episodes a month, the big issue that we have with a lot of the Adobe
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.680]   stuff is that the project file is an XML based.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.160]   So it's not a text based file.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.080]   And the reason we need this is because we'd like to automate lots of stuff and we'd like
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   to be able to send out to a, say, go change this stuff without ever opening the application
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.720]   with Python scripts with Apple.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.480]   So it sounds like the previewer is not aimed at the Pro market that Final Cut is.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.760]   Well, I think it is.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.600]   I think that Apple kind of got into the XML thing.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   I'm not even sure why they put XML in to be honest.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.040]   But it makes it much easier to stream it to other applications.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.240]   Isn't that how it works in the 3D world?
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.760]   Well, the XML, I mean, a lot of us have been really picky for a long time.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.160]   Anytime someone's worked in a really large pipeline, what they want to see is a text-based
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.200]   file format that they can manipulate without actually opening the application.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.440]   Shake was like that.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Or shake is like that.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.560]   So in Final Cut's cases, is it an edit list?
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560]   Is that what it is?
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560]   An EDL?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.640]   No, no, it's not just an edit list.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.720]   The entire project file is an XML.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.840]   So what it means is that everything, if you can figure out, like, if the lower third says
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.880]   "leal the port" on it, we can, if we find "leal the port" in the XML and we change that
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:38.600]   to Merlin Man, when we open up Final Cut again, it'll say Merlin Man.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   Wow.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.040]   That's pretty robust.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   Everything is in there.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.480]   So that's what is super powerful in our eyes.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:50.920]   And until Premiere really did that well, like, really had a text-based format where all the
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.280]   information was exposed, I know for us we wouldn't do that.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.920]   Now, I think that we're one, typically, and Leo will point this out, is we probably exist
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.880]   in 0.5% of the editing market.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.440]   Most editors don't care about that at all.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.600]   I think they should care about it, but I don't think that they do.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.440]   And mostly they just want the new shiny buttons and things that'll make their life easier.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.560]   And I think that Premiere, you know, I think that the great thing is, is if you're getting
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.480]   Premiere, if you're on a PC, you have a very, you know, a very good app that will do just
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.880]   about everything Final Cut will.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.160]   But I don't see us moving anytime.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.600]   One more call before we wrap it up.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.920]   David's on the line from Northridge, California.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.120]   David, welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   Well hello, Leo.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   Hello, gentlemen.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   How's everybody doing?
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.840]   I hope you guys are doing great.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   We're great.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.240]   Thanks for calling in.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.920]   My question is, I'm off from work today, so I'm just so lucky to try talk to you for
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   the first time.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920]   This is something really neat.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.680]   I hope to use it more.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.400]   Well, I hope we're now starting to use it for this is the third show.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.080]   We do, we of course, do net at night.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.600]   We're going to, we did twit and we're going to keep doing that, I think.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.040]   We're doing it very quickly now and we're going to do Windows weekly on Thursday.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   Same time, 4 p.m.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040]   Actually, not the same time.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.760]   4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. East Coast.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.040]   Yeah, that's great because I'm actually going to try my podcast on the talk shoot too.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   I think it's really good to be here.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.560]   Your handle is wedding podcaster.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.960]   You do a podcast about weddings?
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   Yes, I do.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.880]   We spoke a couple years ago.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.560]   We actually met at P&E.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.320]   My podcast is behind the wedding mic.com.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   Where I talk about wedding entertainment.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   That's so cool.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   That's great.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.120]   So it's a great market.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.040]   Be inspired by you listening to your shows and all your hopes and all your gentlemen you
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.040]   talk to.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040]   It just gets me all excited about doing the podcast.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   What's up?
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   What's up?
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   Wonderful idea.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.480]   I was just saying it's a great medium.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   Go ahead.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:49.120]   My question was last fall during this winter, my laptop screen actually popped.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.640]   You know, we have all the static electricity and I actually touched my laptop and my screen
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.920]   just totally burned out.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   Wow.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.920]   That's pretty bad.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.920]   You don't...
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.920]   My question is...
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.920]   No, you go ahead.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.720]   I think I know what your question is going to be and I think I have an answer for you.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   Go ahead.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.720]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.880]   So now that I'm shopping for a new laptop, I've always been Windows based but I've heard
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:17.280]   so much about Macs and, you know, laptop Macs and I want to go do that.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.920]   You got to help me with this because it's a really big jump in price.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.000]   Boy, you called the wrong guys.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.720]   Anybody want to recommend a Windows machine?
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.360]   No, I think we all say Mac, right?
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360]   I'd get an Acer.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.600]   That was the thoughts you could get.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.600]   You know, just...
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.800]   I think they're about 40 bucks.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.000]   Justine was so funny because she scared the heck out of me on...
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   I realize now is April Fools.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.360]   She bought a Sony Vio.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.000]   She changed her blog, you know, she's holding the Mac and it was a Sony Vio.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.080]   I thought it was pink.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.240]   I thought, did she like just because it was pink by that?
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.120]   Well you can get a pink Vio if you really want, which would look good at weddings, I
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.120]   think.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   Which Mac should get?
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.280]   I would lean toward a Mac book.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.560]   I mean, if price is your primary driver and you guys can tell me...
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.560]   Very affordable.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.560]   I think there...
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   It's so funny.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.800]   You guys were talking during Twit about how Dell is shipping their boxes with Linux on
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   it now.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.640]   And just for fun, I sat there and did a price comparison.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.640]   And I don't know.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.320]   I mean, I think, you know, I don't know enough to talk about this stuff in the intelligence.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.360]   But yeah, you can get cheap Windows boxes.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.960]   You can get a $600 laptop, but don't.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   And I just...
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.920]   I would have to say the people I know who have Mac books have been pretty happy with them.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.680]   As Leo has pointed out, you take a hit on, in terms of the video quality, you're not
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.440]   going to be able to run full screen video in your keynote presentation.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:42.240]   But I think you could be really happy with a Mac book with as much RAM and hard drive
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.480]   space as you can afford.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.600]   Andy, you're probably one of the only guys besides me who uses Windows on this show.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.160]   Well, you know, it's surprising.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.080]   They're making some really nice Windows laptops at the student level these days.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.120]   I was going to say that if you really are desperate to spend the least amount of money
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.240]   and get the most bang for the buck, HP makes some really nice little notebooks that are
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   not designed to be overtly stylish.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.520]   They're not designed to be overtly powerful.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.320]   But for your...
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.000]   To deliver the four food groups of computing, you really can't do better than this little
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.560]   $730 notebook that HP sells through Office Macs, through Best Buy, if you're just about
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.560]   any of them.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.360]   You know, Dell also, the Inspiron E1505, which is a core two 15-inch display for about 700
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.960]   bucks is also pretty surprisingly good deal.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   Running VISTA.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   Exactly.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.760]   It's not going to help you edit video or something like that.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.760]   No.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.560]   But once again, as your basic tote and around machine, it's actually fairly good.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.880]   And of course, you have to account for any kind of...
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.960]   If there is any kind of software that you're using for your podcast and your other work
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.040]   that you'd need to replace, you actually need to factor that in as well.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   Right.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   And if you're just going to do something like email, wait for the iPhone.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   [laughter]
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   Zing.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.040]   We got the K2 to the iPhone plug-in.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.040]   I think the...
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040]   The K2 is tied to the Galaxy.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.960]   You just carried around with you and it's all your reference books.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.880]   You upload your articles through it.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   That natal.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.360]   And print on the outside of it.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.640]   Guys, I think we're going to wrap this up.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.000]   I will say that talk shoe was a great success.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   It was really, really fun to do it live to watch your chat as we were talking and to
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   take your calls.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.960]   And I didn't, you know, I announced this this morning on talk shoe.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   We didn't make a big deal about it.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.160]   But I think we'll continue to do these on Tuesday afternoons in talk shoes.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:30.320]   So just watch a talk shoe schedule if you'd like to participate talk shoe, t-a-l-k-s-h-o-e.com.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   I want to thank our guests from the Merlin show at themerlinshow.com.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.520]   And of course, 43 folders, Merlin Man.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   Heck, Leo.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.520]   It's great.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.920]   This is two in a row, two days in a row now.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.160]   You're probably getting pretty burnt out.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.720]   Let's do this every day.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   I already do.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   I already do.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.480]   Today, I already did eight podcasts before I even got on the line with you guys.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.400]   And if you think I'm joking, I'm not.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   Scott.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   I did eight podcasts.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   I did eight gizwizs.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.000]   And then of course, yesterday we had two specials.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.080]   We had this special only in a security now.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.080]   And that's my day off.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.080]   So I'm.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.160]   Do you just get delirious and start confusing where you are?
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.160]   I mean, do you.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   I'm going to go.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.320]   I have to go play desktop tower defense.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.320]   I can't take it anymore.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.840]   I'm actually going through the drive-through window.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.400]   You want one of having an eight hour conversation with a tower.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   Tell me what you think.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.960]   I'm a great thing about virtual networks.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.920]   But what do you think?
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.920]   I'm not.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920]   Sure.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   Here is your change, sir.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920]   It is an occupational hazard.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   Place below.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.040]   That's Andy Anaco, the great Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.720]   You can also catch his online work at cwob.com, the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.840]   Always good to have you on the show.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.640]   Thank you for joining us, Andy.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.640]   Always a slice.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640]   Thanks.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640]   And Scott born is now.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.080]   I don't know what site to promote anymore.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.440]   Podcasting tricks, of course, calm.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   Apple phone.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440]   What is it?
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   Apple phone.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.440]   Apple phone show.com.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.440]   We'll be live in up a little bit tomorrow next week or so.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   Oh, good.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   We're going to go first show up.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.440]   Oh, that's exciting.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.120]   So, it's great to have you.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.720]   And we will talk to you again very soon.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.160]   Alex Lindsey from PixelCore.com.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.400]   Also, PixelCore.tv.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.160]   People have been asking me, Alex, I think we need to cross promoters, something but where
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   Macbreak is.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.160]   But that's where Macbreak lives now.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.160]   Macbreak is it.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.400]   Yeah, and we'll put some more on the show.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.440]   We'll get an idea of what's going on.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.840]   PixelCore.tv is where Macbreak lives.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.800]   And Macbreak Weekly, and this probably is part of the confusion lives right now at Twit.tv.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.760]   We could cross post this if you want whatever you want to do it.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   Yeah, we could do that.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   That'd be fun.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.520]   That'd make it a little easier for people to figure out what's going on.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.800]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.000]   We remind you that Twit.tv is the home of this podcast and many others.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.720]   Even if you're listening on talk show, you'll hear a high quality version later today as
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.040]   soon as I compress it and put it out.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:54.240]   For Twit video from our show on Friday, any day now, I'll start uploading it as soon as
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.600]   he gets off the Skype here.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:03.280]   And we'll be back on TalkShoe on Thursday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time for a live version of
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280]   Windows Weekly.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.640]   That'll be all Q&A, so I'll get your Windows questions lined up.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.880]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.440]   Have a great Mac week.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:11.920]   We'll see you later.
