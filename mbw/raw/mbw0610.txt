[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.840]   the federal company. Do you have a big announcement this week or you were hinting
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.760]   you might. I'm I'm hinting that plans that were sort of ephemeral a few weeks
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.080]   ago are becoming real in that things have been bought and done but so basically
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.960]   priming the pump for an announcement that will come probably just after
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.480]   WWDC I don't want to do it I was hoping to get it done before WWDC but now it won't
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.840]   be done enough before WWDC that anybody will pay any attention to it so.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.560]   Wow are you cryptic. Anyway it's great to have you. If you want to find what he's
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   up to right now go to IHNATKO.com or I'm the baby IHNATKO. I have no idea how
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.960]   to spell your name IHN I have no at co also you should get an acronym for the
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.480]   whole name just the first three letters but I'm just saying it. Or I could just I
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.240]   was about to say I could just change my name to Smith but then I have to say no
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.000]   it's with a why not you would be that guy Alex Lindsay's here from the
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.400]   Picsoko or he's working on some 3D project or is this something I kind of
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.960]   consider photo photo scan or photogrammetry kind of knitting so like when I'm
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.640]   sitting around I throw photos into it and then I'm going to go back to work and so
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.320]   I had this little thing I bought in India this little stamp and oh it's a 3D of
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.480]   the stamp 3D model I couldn't fit it looks really cool yeah and so I was
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.200]   just and I had shot at this morning from my on my porch and and joining us once
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   again I'm so glad she's back this is her third time rock star alcoholic and
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   deputy managing editor I'm more Lori Gill hi Lori hi thanks thanks I consider
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.920]   knitting to be knitting I just knit do you knit yeah my mom taught me to knit I
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.480]   could see how that would be very soothing it is when you're watching a movie
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.840]   you're just kind of sitting around the house especially in the winter time and
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.880]   then you get scars and you get scarves and hats and loves and socks and all kinds
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.600]   of fun back when I was addicted to Farmville my wife said you're farming again I
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.960]   said yeah she said why don't you just knit you at least you have something at
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.320]   the end of the day that's kind of like there's a couple things whether it's
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.720]   stitching panoramas or or or a photogrammetry which the computer does most
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.360]   of the work so you're kind of like you don't have to think about very much you
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.760]   just kind of throw things in and see how it cooks on the way out and so it's
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.320]   something you can kind of do while you're fiddling with other things and I have a
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   couple computers that are almost constantly running yeah do you make scarves
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.800]   Laurie is that mostly what you knit or I've made scarves and hats and socks and
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.400]   like warmers gloves you mostly just a knitting or do you think I haven't done
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.080]   as made shirts like sweaters I haven't done that you stitch work as well is it
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.120]   just knitting or is it stitching is too much you have to go like this I don't
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.760]   think you know stitching is not I think knitting is nice because you don't have
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.800]   to look at it yeah so I mean I knit I crochet I I do some stitch work but not
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.120]   a bunch it's just it's just a fun little crafty thing to keep your hands
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.400]   busy so you know they sent Laurie to Google I/O across the aisles sort of
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.920]   speak to see if you could handle all the googly goodness what you had an
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.400]   interesting take on it actually yeah so what I kind of what I kind of learned
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.880]   from from listening to what the what the speakers that Google had to say was
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   it's it's time to kind of come together and stop being so divided with our
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   platforms and I'm sure I'm sure there's a lot of things that that you know are
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.440]   under under the table that I don't really understand but it seemed very
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.720]   inclusive and very trying to promote inclusivity amongst the platforms instead
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.440]   of you know I'm an iPhone or I'm an Android phone and how about let's just
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   have the same stuff across devices I know that's not the easiest thing to
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.840]   kind of develop but I love this idea I saw some of the things that Google was
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.480]   doing and thought I really want that for iPhone I saw some other things that
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.400]   Google was doing and they said and you can do it on iPhone and I was just so
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   overjoyed with that I'd love to see a lot more of that kind of kind of coming
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   together of cross-platform sort of unity and developers being able to work on
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.440]   on multiple platforms without having to worry about how to do it how to sit like
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.120]   having separate things that can't be shared there's more and more people that
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.560]   are using iPhones with PCs max with Android phones it it's just better for
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.520]   all of us if our if we can be kind of like integrated in our software and
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.880]   usability Apple used to be that way when they were a minority operating system
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.760]   there's still a minority operating system but not with the iPhone there a
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.040]   majority up for the iPhone but in no one market there but that's where you start
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   to be and that's what happens I mean I've seen this happen so many times
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.400]   Microsoft used to be and then when they when they started to see their
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.800]   market share slipped to iPhone they like Google but Microsoft says exactly the
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   same thing we just want to work for everybody well Apple Apple Apple I'm only
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.160]   silo it you only do the ecosystem play when you're dominant enough that you
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.840]   could you could make it work but Apple's only one there are a small percentage of
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.440]   the overall phone market yeah there but there's no excuse they should be more
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.000]   open I don't I don't think that Apple is actually so closed off they are but I
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   think that it's important for the company to kind of control the content
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   that they refused to make IPL's messages for Android what does that tell
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.120]   you that's it tells me that they that there's reasons behind why they are
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.080]   deciding to make these to deciding these choices and and they're trying to
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.000]   have so they're trying to control what the user has you know if I have a device
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.120]   and that I think is the most wonderful perfect device in the world and somebody
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.200]   puts something on it that makes it less of an awesome experience I'm to blame
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.760]   for that and my phone looks bad so I'm gonna control who gets to put stuff on
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.840]   my phone and what they get to put on my phone that's their rationalization for
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.240]   doing what's good business there it really comes down to okay do what's
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.680]   right for users or do you do what's right for the company what's right for
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.200]   users to make a messaging platform that operates everywhere what's right for
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.000]   the companies to try to lock people into your product that's that's where that's
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400]   some stuff I was starting to realize when I was at IO I really I really
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.760]   appreciate this idea of not locking things in and it's real beautiful to see
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.840]   that kind of grow technology instead of sort of protecting it well let's grow
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.400]   with it let's make it better for all users and and stop being so sort of
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.960]   protective of what it is I completely agree with that and to be fair making
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.760]   software and services that run on everything is to Google's business
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.360]   benefit there yes they don't sell hardware they're really not in that
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.720]   business so but that's why it's always funny to to see here each CEO or each
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.080]   like senior executive talk about the virtues of the company and they're saying
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.680]   well we will never do this and we believe strongly that the importance of
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.640]   technology and it's never and even though it means we're totally have to
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   shoot us ourselves in the foot and build an entirely new business model to
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.720]   be fit to live by these principles no it's always it's always we have a we
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   have a philosophy that of course has a lot of things tied into it doesn't
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   doesn't doesn't have to be just one thing and they find the ways to do the best
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.240]   for their users through that philosophy well that's why my point was you can
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.640]   you can kind of track a company's attitude towards this by how dominant
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.720]   they are when when they're like they don't have to you if they don't have to
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.920]   compete so they don't exactly I'm with you Laurie I mean I come from an era when
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.720]   you know I mean I still do believe in open computing open platforms non
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:06.360]   proprietary systems I believe strongly that's how all of this started and it
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.280]   was only when companies started to dominate and said oh we could take
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.120]   advantage of our market share and close off the other guy that they start they
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.120]   start being predatory and started looking more towards their interests than the
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.960]   end users interests that's why I think really and this is radical all software
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.240]   should be open source and free but that's very radical to say that yeah I think
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.760]   that I guess from a user perspective though I do think that having the company
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:44.000]   focusing mostly on its platform I do think makes it more stable so and
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.720]   allows them to innovate in those areas and and I you know I think that what's
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.240]   interesting is is that I actually think that and I think Apple's gone a little
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.800]   way from this but when I think part of the whole thing is is the idea that the
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.880]   phone isn't that it is not that as important to Apple as it is to other
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:05.240]   folks and so the idea is that is that you know we're gonna our job is more to
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   make it simple and easy than it is to necessarily put every bell and whistle
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   into it and I think that that is a different approach to the to the problem
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.160]   and you know I have everything I have Linux and Windows and Android and you
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:24.120]   know I have everything the thing that reliably works the best is my is my
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.640]   phone you know it and you know doesn't work all the time but it is the most
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.280]   reliable and my mags are the thing that I know that I'm gonna generally do
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.840]   exactly what I expect them to do when I expect them to not always but on all
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   the OS is that I'm I'm probably you know literally a Mac OS is probably less
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.800]   than 50% of my time these days so I'm spending time time in Windows and
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   Android and Linux for a variety of reasons and they're all you know they
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.600]   are all little unstable but the Mac is the most stable and if someone asked me
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.200]   like what I was gonna give my parents I'm not gonna I would not recommend
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.520]   anything other than iOS or or the Mac because it's gonna work you know and
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.040]   they don't it's gonna save them a lot of time you know and so so anyway so I
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.000]   think that I think there is an advantage for Apple beyond just the
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.960]   business model of lock-in to be constantly managing that for a certain
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.360]   population which is which is I'm an already of the world is using their
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.040]   their operating system but the thing that's so unusual is that on the one hand
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   they're they're locking in their their usability but they're also promoting
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.040]   this idea that the Mac or the iPhone is this sort of every man's computer and
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.560]   every man's device not for the techies but for everybody so it's kind of it's
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.360]   so counter to what I imagine they they would want to be doing which is making
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.480]   the all of the platform or all of the technology accessible for everybody but
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.840]   it's it seems like they're kind of at odds with both of those thoughts of like
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.880]   let's make a device that is simple for everybody to use but let's lock it down
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:09.080]   so that I keep coming back to an interview that I once read but with someone who
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.280]   used to work for Walt Disney when he was building the theme parks that that
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.240]   Walt when you when they were designing Disney Land in Disney World
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.640]   Walt wanted to make sure that if you came to these parks you would have a
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.040]   great time and he was felt that was so important he would he wanted to make
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.160]   sure you couldn't have a bad time even if you were trying to have a bad time and
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.120]   to me that's Apple it's the idea that if we control most the experience it's not
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.720]   about controlling the user and it's not just it's not about lock-in it's more
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.960]   that we feel as though a user who gives up the ability to get root access to to
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.800]   a phone or command line that's a small or easily more to the point more easily
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.640]   move a file from a from a device onto the phone or the the tablet where it can
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.040]   do the user some good that's a that's a downside but the upside is greater
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.000]   stability greater predictability we don't have to the usual never have to
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.240]   parse any error codes we can actually handle errors by simply bouncing people
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.640]   back to the launcher and that will kind of solve the problem for them because on
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.520]   the back end it'll be solved elsewhere and they don't have to deal with it so I
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.560]   mean this we've got I've been on cruises Leo's been on cruises there are some
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.720]   people that when the ship goes into this an exotic port some people want to
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.400]   spend $140 and be taken to the distillery to have the package tour of the
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.800]   rum factory some people just want to hail a cab or jump on a bus and just go
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.080]   wherever they want in this country and in this town that they've never been in
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.640]   before and the person who the people go to the rum factory they're getting what
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.680]   they want out of it part of that is stability and security and knowing what
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.440]   what the experience is going to be like the people who jump on the bus where
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.800]   they don't understand the money or the map or the or the language they're getting
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.120]   where they want which is the ability to go where their minds want to lead them
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.040]   even though it might lead them someplace 30 miles away from the ship but it
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.760]   finally has to pull out a port without them yeah but apples kind of like the
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.880]   cruise ship that only lets you go to the rum factory right I mean not so much
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.400]   on the Mac I have to say and I think that really there's two apples and
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.880]   there's the apple of old days where they really were a minority and they
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.640]   really were the upstarts and they were the computer for the rest of us and they
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.160]   and then there's the apple of the iPhone era where they're absolutely
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.560]   dominant and profit and and and and would very much like to lock people into
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.760]   the apple ecosystem and that's why Laurie I think you have that odd conflict is
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.720]   that there's parts of apples DNA that really are open and non-proprietary and
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.560]   embracing the world and then there's parts of them to say well from a
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.600]   business point of view the best thing would be if everybody used iTunes Apple
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:50.040]   music iCloud iPhone and all the rest and you know I'm of the first part I I
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.840]   love Mac messages I love apple from the old days from the Mac days mess messages
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.360]   is an interesting case though because it's not like it's not like you can't
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.120]   move I iOS on to generic hardware because if there's just too much intimacy
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.680]   between the design of the software and the design of the hardware you can't do
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   that and but Apple would never allow it because they're a hard work I'm saying
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.680]   I'm saying that there I think but messages messages is probably the one
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.440]   app that Apple has in its portfolio where they're messaging on multiple
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.520]   multiple platforms is right now a huge mess look at Google who was just
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.840]   released what their ninth tenth stab at some sort of a cross-platform
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.720]   messaging standard and their big their big solution is to try to convince all
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.600]   of the United States carriers to please use this new upgrade to SMS that
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.440]   they're promoting so that built-in phone messaging apps can handle it so if
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.720]   Apple were to port messages to Android and to make make sure that there was a
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.360]   desktop gateway that would work really really well they could own it
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:51.600]   right now even as a iOS messaging platform they don't they don't deliver
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.800]   any unique features that are really really special but they could add
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   security they could add multimedia so I don't know why they don't probably
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.680]   because it's a much bigger problem to solve than it is for someone like me to
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.880]   spot off about on a Tuesday morning Tuesday afternoon on a podcast but I
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.600]   don't I think it's hard I mean I don't think it's hard I think it's really
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.840]   about lockers the same reason Steve Jobs hated the idea making iTunes available
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.060]   on Windows was fortunately persuaded otherwise and that was what made the
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.760]   iPod a success but it's that same mentality I really think that Apple it
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.400]   was sick I mean everything else is cross-platform signals cross-platform
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.580]   totally secure totally reliable but there's no reason Apple couldn't put
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.820]   messages on any platform it wanted to it doesn't want to I think it's I just
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.760]   think it doesn't want to bother I think that's the yeah like it's like I
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.520]   don't they don't have any business reason I don't think it's it's it's a
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.660]   strong contrary business but but you have a you have a with all these companies
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.420]   you have a lot of things to focus on you have a certain number of engineers
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.500]   yeah we've talked about that do I make do I make am I really gonna make more
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.620]   money by making it available in Android probably not to why bother you know
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.100]   like you know and I think that that's a very valid business decision of I'm
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   already making plenty money on this why would I bother it's not I don't think
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.060]   it's as much of a we're definitely gonna hold everybody in and do all those
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.580]   things other than I just don't have the resources and I'm not interested it
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.140]   makes sense you know yeah and comes from the point of view of consumer I tell
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.300]   you why you bother the risk that a consumer is gonna find a cross-platform
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.420]   solution that they prefer but you don't have to because the iPhone has such lock
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:27.420]   in that no matter what comes out it's not it's not really it's a really pleasant
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.100]   little dome to be locked into I mean I agree if you use my iPhone notes but go
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.060]   ahead and try these and Android people you know this and you made the
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.420]   transition yeah I mean and I and to me not being not being stuck with one a
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.100]   piece of hardware was so important even before I switched to to Android I just
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   thought as a matter of principle I'm gonna find alternative to notes I'm gonna
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.700]   find alternatives to all the apps that I use that are exclusive to iOS but for a
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.540]   lot of people they really are people who despite the the luster of the Apple
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.220]   brand despite how cool iPhones are they really are walking into a phone store
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.820]   and intending to walk out with a phone just a practical device that does that
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.060]   does certain jobs for them and a lot of people believe it or not do I'm sorry I
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.380]   was about to denigrate everyone who uses Apple Maps but when you compare like
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.700]   what Apple Maps can do and how well it does it to what Google Maps can do and
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.220]   how well it does it you start to you have to it makes me have to really
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.620]   appreciate how important it is to people that look there is this app that's
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.900]   already installed all I don't download anything I don't have to learn anything
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.580]   I tap it and it works notes is really competitive for all the other notes
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.980]   apps out there they're not really locked in they're just using the app that they
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.100]   really really like so it's a there's it's a complex set of variables that
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.660]   everybody has to navigate and if it weren't for the fact that there is such
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.780]   a vibrant alternative ecosystem of mobile apps out there in the form of
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.300]   Android it'd be a much more serious and grave conversation we'd be having Apple
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.500]   is the Apple is the choice the refuge for people that are absolutely a
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:01.280]   a guest if you present them with 10 choices about how to do something and
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.500]   Android is for people who either a want to spend $300 for a phone that would
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.180]   cost $700 if it had an Apple logo on it and for people who like I want to be
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.500]   able to put a contact name like on the springboard I want to be able to
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   Bluetooth a file from point A to point B I want to be able to use accessories
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:24.660]   for my home stereo that don't work on iOS because of of sandboxing so so long
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.380]   as there's that opportunity and those alternatives I think everybody's in
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.820]   gravy here let's take a little break when we come back I want to talk about
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:38.700]   rumors of course WWDC just around the corner and a class action lawsuit over
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:45.500]   the Apple keyboard I'm not going to join it but I'm some kind of rooting for
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   them a little bit I just want Apple to put a decent keyboard on the next
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   generation looking forward to that check for 78 cents when they win the course
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.420]   it's a no win and Apple's not going to pay any attention to this but I just
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.300]   would I well let's talk about that's great back yeah we'll come back in
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.540]   second I want to talk a little bit about my blogging platform right now
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.500]   WordPress dot com gosh I love WordPress every time I use it I love it more I

[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:02.220]   on the Twitter deputy managing editor for iMore and a rock star I saw you
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.820]   wearing your headphones at the Google I/O concert because you have tinnitus and I
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:12.820]   thought yeah me too me too that was silly of me I actually usually have a pair of
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.140]   earplugs with me everywhere I go just in case I do I carry them I carry them in
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.460]   my what my briefcase all the time yeah yeah and this time I happened to have
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.740]   left them back at the hotel which was so ridiculous of me the one night that I
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.900]   was going to see a live concert so yeah that was my mistake you want to know
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:38.940]   I actually put these headphones on they look familiar yeah it helps sure it did
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:45.540]   yeah yeah I got my my right ear now is much that ringings even louder because I
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.540]   went to a concert a year ago oh yeah it's right now mine goes on and off oh you
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.540]   good good for you congratulations I went to a concert I went to see Hell's
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:03.460]   Bells the AC DC tribute band oh there you go all ladies and they're so good but
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.780]   I boom it hit this one ear I was gonna just yeah and I and it started ringing
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.300]   and it hasn't stopped since but I've always had it ringing in my ears because
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.020]   I used to as a kid probably like you Laurie as a rock star sit too close to
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.340]   those darn speakers and you don't know to protect your well yeah the mistake I
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.700]   made was I spent more than 10 years playing live music without earplugs so
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.860]   that was really ridiculous of me to do if I could go back into anybody anybody
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.540]   here's a musician that's listening to this right now don't be stupid wear earplugs
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.900]   because 10 or 15 years down the road when you get that ringing in your ear and it
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:45.260]   won't go away it really so depressing although and I think a lot of people think
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.100]   that older people like me and people with ringing in the ears and any kit don't
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.220]   hear music fully and even though it's ringing I hear all of the music you know
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.140]   the high end maybe it'll tenuate a little bit but I hear all of the music I enjoy
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.860]   music just as much as I did yeah definitely the ringing goes away if the
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.140]   music is loud enough I'm sure you've noticed that it kind of hurts to listen
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   to loud music now yes yeah and whereas when we were younger or when our ears
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.780]   are really it didn't actually hurt oh it felt good that's why I like to hear
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.180]   it here's it here's a shared experience where you the first time you realize
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.220]   that oh my god you you visit Amazon or something realize oh my god disposable
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.380]   earplugs are like a buck and a half yeah I can I can buy like a whole jar of
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.060]   them and have like three of them in my pocket wherever I go so that not only
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.900]   like am I protecting my hearing but I will make the best friend I I'll ever
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.620]   make my life by being out of consciousness oh you look like you're in
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.700]   distress would you like some free would you like some earplugs that clearly
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.740]   are in a package that I've never been used before and then it's like their
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.420]   magic you put them in your ears and suddenly you're a
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.860]   of the last time I used them I was on the 4th of July parade and
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.260]   the fire department didn't understand that sirens are meant to be listened to
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.940]   as the truck is driving past at 50 miles an hour not crawling at
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.420]   walking space and so it's like oh that's right I can fix this anyway when my
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.020]   kids were younger I I carry a whole bag and then I just hand them out to like
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.180]   three rows above the front and below and behind I just say
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.460]   it was at least it was a joke and everyone laughed and then people didn't
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.100]   bother me when my kids were crying and upset and everything else out so it
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.260]   took a little I felt better I'm going to see pink on Friday
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.100]   and you better believe I'll be wearing my my headphones how what where is she
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.620]   playing my earplits she's playing at the Oracle arena I pretty much don't go to
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.820]   anything with more than like 500 people now I wish you could see people like
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.900]   pink without they should do tours like that she's doing all this aerial work
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.740]   she actually needs somewhere big enough to do so she needs
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.500]   a warrior style every once in a while these these these artists will do these
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   like little like 700 to 1000 oh you always hear the rumors oh yeah the
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.780]   who they played at a nightclub downtown after their big gig
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.060]   and you always think oh I wish I'd known that the Rolling Stones too used to do
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.300]   that all the time yeah I'm not you know ethically I would not be
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.180]   allowed to take like a ten thousand dollar bribe from Apple
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.500]   but they did but they did have like Foo Fighters played like a four song
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.820]   mini concert I'll never forget that yeah for like that had like only like 300
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.340]   500 people in it and that was worth a ten thousand dollar
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.940]   bribe I was a I was well primed like my favorite band
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.780]   and hearing them like and being able to like sit down while listening with
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.620]   people who are not going to just be standing up going whoa
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.660]   and he paid five hundred dollars to see my back and hear me go whoa
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.860]   you actually met Dave Grohl didn't you did you get a chance to see him or talk
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.860]   to him I didn't meet Mr. Grohl I did meet Mr. Smear
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:47.020]   oh nice after after trying to figure out how do I address Mr. Smear
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:53.340]   I don't know if that's his given name his or his confirmation name or I
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.460]   don't know that's one thing I love about Japan
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.100]   male female first name last name if you add son at the end that's appropriate
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.500]   I can call you Alex son lindsay son and it's appropriate
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.340]   and it and you know and it works and it's a sign of respect I love that well I'm
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.540]   just that's what you do you call him schmears son
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   or simply in in America we have our own
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.100]   customs at work we just simply call people dude dude dude dude
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:28.540]   dude you do that with everybody Alexa and Siri can hear a hidden command
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:34.220]   that you can't actually yeah that's creepy yeah this this is a little misleading
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.180]   thank you New York Times for this headline what it really is is
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.420]   researchers to figure out a way to send
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:49.020]   say music with commands built in and activate echoes or a series
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.220]   and get them to do things you can hide in 2016 they showed you could hide
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.700]   commands in white noise that's a little easier because white noise is
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.380]   multi-frequency but now they're getting to the point where they can put it in
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:05.820]   recordings of music and even spoken text
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.540]   yeah there's a lot of fear mongering here um
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.100]   well I don't know if this was in the I can't remember if this was in the New
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.380]   York Times coverage or the other tech coverage based on the New York Times
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.380]   coverage this or you can or people can or these commands can order things
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.740]   through this through it through Amazon or something so no they can't because
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.700]   people always don't mention that you actually have to have some sort of a
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.980]   passcode and confirmation with this it is old news
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.740]   note this has been found in the field and the thing that also kind of
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.180]   encourages me that this isn't going to become a widespread problem is that
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.420]   uh you realize that all the uh after the after the command has been
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.340]   activated and the device is now communicating with the server
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.140]   to make all this magic stuff happen the server actually understands the
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.940]   velocity and the type of command that's being sent
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.460]   it's the reason why like uh during a super bowl commercial or something they
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.580]   can advertise uh they can advertise uh the Amazon
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.620]   they can say they can have a somebody in an ad say hey aliosha
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:06.140]   and 10 million uh devices don't light up because by the time that that that
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.380]   that command hits the uh a system inside that system decides oh wait a
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.860]   minute this isn't one person in peoria this is 10 million people all at once
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.900]   I bet this is a commercial or something so therefore we're not gonna we're
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.620]   not gonna hit on that command but this could be targeted against you
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.740]   particularly or you could put it in you know you could send a text
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.780]   message uh you know with apple's message as you could send
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.340]   the voice you could send audio I mean it doesn't necessarily trigger a
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   bunch of them but that burger king remember that burger king ad
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.580]   where the ad said it was an online ad I think what what's a
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.740]   whopper and I'm sorry my google fired uh yeah uh of course google was
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.660]   peeved mightily and disabled that what had happened is
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.860]   the the Burger King folks had modified the wikipedia page to put an ad in it
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.260]   and then the google asks wiki you know gets us answers from wikipedia
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.780]   uh there was a south part i didn't know this this is the New York Times
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.340]   there was a south park episode the entire episode built around voice
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.860]   commands that caused viewers voice recognition assistance to parrot
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:14.140]   adolescent obscenities now that's funny that's great that's funny
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.100]   I mean I think all these things when we're having fun with it I will say that I
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.940]   think that it's great because it it shows the developers
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.660]   where the weak points are and what they're what they're doing without causing
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.660]   any real damage um so they can start thinking about what those problems
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.860]   are and you know when it's fun like that I think it's buying these
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.260]   obscenities I think won't be as fun how about this one this is called the
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.540]   dolphin attack they play um stuff at a frequency in audible to the
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:44.700]   human ear especially lory and my ears uh and and then it mutes the phone so
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.620]   that the user doesn't hear the system's responses
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.700]   this is an example of the dolphin attack comes out of china by the way
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:10.620]   so that was the audible one yeah
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:18.220]   now let's try it with the dolphin sounds phone is locked
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.100]   listen see if you can hear it
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.740]   no
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.940]   yeah you can see the screen lighting up and wobbling like a theory and it's
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.500]   making the call yeah one I think it's like that's
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.980]   something that's an easy one to fix just by limiting the frequency that the
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.420]   the device is willing to yeah you know that's that's
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.740]   I don't I don't know how hard it would be to do that but what I think most
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:48.060]   figures I know I know that we'll pass to do a low pass at 12k
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:54.940]   to well to anticipate that that the the activation the thing that the
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.860]   the activation thing is isn't being done by really good processors being done by
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.940]   an asic so maybe the lover I'm speculating here maybe the level of
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.340]   power that of that asic isn't enough to do like notch filtering to make sure
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.540]   that I'm not going to listen to anything this beyond a human voice
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.660]   but the I think I also think that I know the google is moving really really fast
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:20.220]   towards really making sure that it kind that identify the actual user the
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.540]   person who's act who's actually authorized to give commands to the device
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:29.100]   not only so that if you say hey Guillermo what's my what's my next appointment
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.580]   only only I get it and my my friend in the house doesn't get it
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.100]   but also to prevent this kind of a fraud I think that's what they think that the
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.140]   the solution to this is that's going to I think it's going to be a defining
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:46.460]   standout feature for these things yeah I think that this idea that it's
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:52.220]   inaudible is the thing that kind of scares me a little bit and and not to
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.860]   kind of join that fear mongering but it's not about what it can do now it's
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.300]   about the potential of what could happen in the future with this kind of stuff
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:04.060]   and right now maybe all all an inaudible signal could do is
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.500]   possibly make your phone make a phone call if it happens to be within
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.140]   a few feet of your phone but the potential of of what could happen in
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.900]   the future I think at that same New York Times article talked about
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:25.820]   technology that could actually trigger your phone to react up to 25 feet away
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.540]   so they've already improved on on what is possible and at this point I'm
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.260]   thousands and thousands of people have some kind of speakers smart speaker in
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.380]   their home some of us have multiple speakers some of us have multiple
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.700]   speakers from different brands so all of these companies have to get on
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.700]   board to make sure that these speakers are safe enough that they're not going
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.100]   to be triggered by right now might be an innocuous
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.100]   joke or simple gesture that doesn't make much doesn't do much damage but could
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.740]   potentially do a lot of damage in the future so I don't know
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.460]   I wonder if there's a whole new security stack planned around this because I know
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.060]   that even before there were smart speakers there was a concern that a
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.460]   lot of malware was propagating from computer to computers that were not
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.020]   even on a network by letting these computers talk to each other by
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.500]   simply activating microphone barking up barking out something
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.580]   inaudible frequency but then the microphone in another computer is also
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.100]   sensitive enough to pick up that and understand it and send enough binary
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.900]   data to create an executable that could then do something really really bad
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.020]   so I don't know if that has led to security experts who are designing
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:39.660]   these systems inside hardware to anticipate that sort of thing but
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.700]   isn't it hard isn't it terrible that you
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.660]   is the humans they're so creative and they're so clever
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.540]   they are they're wonderful you almost want to like say
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:55.660]   that is a great idea put in audible stuff in in speakers so that microphones
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.460]   will pick them up in action on them but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.580]   to worry about this crap stop being so clever about being
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.060]   just yeah you you're so smart and cool stop it
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.020]   well I'm like I'm just amazing how like we're talking about Burger King
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.620]   you're really yes really really clever but why don't you put that cleverness
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:17.100]   into making burgers that actually tastes like food
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.300]   no no come on I'm surprised at how how the how
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.580]   the Amazon product we'll keep the name out
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.100]   has become so ubiquitous in my family in the
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.100]   we only have it in the in the kitchen but asking for timers and asking for
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.380]   the weather and asking for my kids will just randomly ask it for
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.340]   information and if it doesn't cough up good information they'll be like oh I'm
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.180]   I'll go google it now you know but but the first place they're going to ask is
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.140]   is the device you know of of some something that they're trying to
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.580]   figure out and I'm just amazed that you know I didn't really do any work
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.420]   on it at all I got one for my I got an echo show for my
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.460]   for my parents as well and it sat there for a while they didn't really
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.540]   understand it and one of my nephews just came over or nieces came over and
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.020]   just just turned the whole thing on got it all working
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.340]   and and now they they use it all the time and so it is it is something that I
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.140]   think has a lot of use but and I think that we're going to end up in kind of an
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.740]   arms race for a little while of people doing nefarious things with it and
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:18.060]   people closing down those nefarious things I
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   greatly doubt that I think that hacking IOT for
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.780]   uh DDOS is probably a bigger fear and much more complicated
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.540]   to defend against than what we're talking about yeah yeah
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.620]   these little voices that have noticed they're not you know they're unlocked
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.980]   in there I mean you know and it's you know millions and millions and
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.140]   millions of them that are they're already in the wild
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.260]   there's nothing to do about them and it's going to be almost impossible to fix
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.820]   that problem I think it will be solved in time
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.900]   by uh and we've already seen a little bit of this trainable
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.580]   voice assistance that can be really locked into your voice
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.580]   I think it's going to be locked into I think it's going to start taking
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.140]   multiple things it's going to know your voice it's going to be the fact that
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.020]   you use you know uh your face recognition to
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.300]   log in it's going to pay to a lot of time and it's going to start looking at
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.220]   the heuristics of all your your and and the average thing and and this is a
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.780]   this is something that wouldn't you wouldn't normally ask for you know
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.820]   those are all things that are coming from the proximity of your even just the
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.340]   proximity of your phone right right so if I if I can't see your phone on the
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.300]   Wi-Fi network I ain't I ain't paying attention to you
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:23.100]   apple reached on Thursday a new stock high
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.460]   of 190 bucks the the countdown to a trillion
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.900]   is on man this was of course because they're great
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.100]   quarterly results but also Warren Buffett saying I was he was going to buy
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.740]   more apple he bought a lot of apple in January
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.300]   their current market cap nine hundred thirteen and a half billion dollars
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.860]   uh it's getting pretty close to a trillion
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.740]   now here's the stat that just blows me away from CNBC
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.540]   apple made more profit last quarter then Amazon is generated
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.420]   during its entire lifetime okay I I called bs on this
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:04.140]   I thought I was really surprised that like a business site would be
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.300]   would be so glib about that because it doesn't mean that Amazon is on
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.700]   unprofitable it means that their Amazon's idea is that when you have profits
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.820]   you put them right back into the company and develop whole new markets
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.140]   and that's why they have Amazon Echo when nobody else had Amazon Echo
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.940]   that's why they had Kindle when I had Kindle that's why they had Amazon Web
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.620]   Services and that's why they have moved on from being the
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:32.140]   with the biggest online retailer to let's get we seem to sell a lot of pants
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.420]   and we understand because we've been watching people for 10 years buying pants
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.180]   we understand what makes people buy pants now let's manufacture our own brand of
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.980]   pants now let's now let's make now let's
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:47.180]   sell people not other people's diapers but we will sell our own brand of diapers
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:51.900]   so that's and that's when people say that oh well Amazon hasn't made a profit
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.420]   yet it's not like Tesla not making a profit this is a company that says
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.860]   every time we make another billion dollars they have so many different
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.220]   units they will move money from one unit to the other to
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.740]   not to shore up their books but to say okay well we need some more money to
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:11.820]   fund this idea so and also the you you you also tend to look at the
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.620]   what's taught what shareholders are doing and shares of Amazon keep going up
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.380]   but the Amazon stock is doing extremely well which means that whatever they're
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.460]   doing shareholders are very very happy with it I think Warren Buffett
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.260]   said that he still wishes that he had bought Amazon early
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.700]   no no no no he said I didn't buy Amazon because Amazon is a miracle
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   and I don't invest in miracles okay sorry he said he wish he bought
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.420]   Microsoft and he said now I can't buy Microsoft because I'm friends with
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.380]   Bill no you've I've always made this point that
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.460]   looking at Amazon's profit is silly because they totally can they have it
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.940]   basically Amazon's Jeff Bezos has a knob in his office that says profit and he
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.140]   could turn it up and down depending on how much money he wants to take off the
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.100]   table this quarter and most of the time he wants to put it back in the company
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.620]   but that does raise it's relevant with Apple because of course of this
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:07.180]   hundred billion dollar stock buyback apples in a very good position
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.660]   cash wise and they're doing something the shareholders love which is buying
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.140]   back a bunch of stock which means the shareholders
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.820]   exit you know the outstanding stock is more valuable more and Buffett loves
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.460]   that and it's not shareholders but should they
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.500]   who else loves a hundred billion dollar buyback I know who doesn't please
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.420]   Ralph's later I know yeah employees you know because any but well they're
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.220]   shareholders that's why they are but stock options more but it's really
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:34.380]   important to understand the math is it's not just the people it's not the
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:39.180]   car I can and they're not but the thing is is that if the stock goes down
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.700]   regularly in a highly competitive market for talent
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.740]   they have a huge talent retention problem so when you look at that buying
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.020]   that you know it's not it employee retention is a
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:56.380]   huge deal in Silicon Valley and people and a lot of their their income is
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.140]   coming from stock you know some from shares
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.260]   and so you know they they get a smaller salary and a huge set of shares they'll
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.140]   all be millionaires when they when they when they leave as long as it keeps
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.740]   going up so these buybacks are not simply to
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.540]   handle outside people it's also to handle inside people and make sure that they
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.460]   stay happy Ralph Nader I'm not sure I well anyway
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.140]   let's say Ralph Nader published an open letter to Tim Cook saying there were so
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.140]   many better ways you could spend that hundred billion dollars he said if you
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.580]   took two percent of it two billion dollars you could have wore a full
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.500]   year's pay bonus to the 350,000 Foxconn workers
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.940]   who sweat for your immense wealth and difficult workplace conditions unable
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.300]   to afford the Apple phones they manufacture
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.300]   you could I'm not sure this one's more interesting you could also invest in
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.460]   research and development and of course he he's interested in the public
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:52.140]   benefit so to diminish the effects of your company's toxic supply chain
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.660]   or you know make make the next big thing you could cut your prices
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.700]   these are all I'd like to point out these are all suggestions from someone who's
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.900]   never actually run a company yeah I mean they are just those boneheaded
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.780]   you know like you know like you know it's just like this is the stupid stuff
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.940]   that as someone who who struggles through day to day making payroll and
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.380]   moving forward these are the idiotic things that people say when they don't
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.020]   when they've never run their own company you know like you know whether you
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.580]   know there are because there are really there are two
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.860]   two sets of people then people kind of fit between them there are people who are
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.300]   on payroll and people trying to make payroll and and the thing is people
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.660]   who on payroll shouldn't often talk about the people trying to make payroll
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.260]   because it's a it's a war you know and the thing is like the stuff he's
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.460]   talking about okay we're gonna pay people more well change people salaries
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:41.740]   you know is an incredible you know endeavor especially when you have
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.060]   hundreds of thousands employees you know R&D to make things better
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.300]   they're already spending that money on that you know they're you know they're
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.780]   not you know they're they don't need a hundred billion dollars well we should
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.940]   point out that they're close to becoming the largest
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.180]   spender on R&D in the world Neil Seibert says this is about Avalon
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.700]   their ramp up is significant over the last few years and they're constantly
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.900]   spending money on finding ways to make make things more you know the where
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.460]   they're getting the where they're getting goods out of Africa where they're
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.380]   doing all these other things that that is something that they're
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.420]   constantly running little drips of this is what they may already be doing
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.380]   what naders talking about the thing is they have the money they're not doing
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.220]   is dropping the price of no but those things like like but drop
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.860]   people pay it but that's a permanent thing that you do
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.940]   right you know in a company that is that doesn't affect oh we got money right
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.460]   now it affects you know it makes way more sense to to make
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.700]   capital investments which they're doing constantly because capital investments
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.900]   are a much better investment because you have the money right now you spend it
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.140]   on right now you what you don't do is start changing
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.340]   your payroll or your or your prices i also have been convinced by Tim saying
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.740]   was it Tim or it was somebody at apple saying
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.980]   it's you really don't want to buy big companies these these historically
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.100]   you know del buying emc or or uh compact hp buying compact
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.820]   historically have not gone well because culture because culture yeah it's hard
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.340]   to absorb these big companies actually kind of honor apples were you know
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.700]   very careful judicious purchase of companies yeah
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.740]   um i think there's something to comment on though is that the sort of ideology
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.220]   behind what rough nader was talking about
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.620]   yeah when it comes to logistics logistics it's bone-headed
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:23.020]   but um the idea of it that a hundred billion dollars
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.620]   that's a lot of money right that's that's a lot of money and
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.620]   two percent of one billion dollars is still a lot of money
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:35.980]   i think maybe the what we can kind of take from what what nader had had said
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:41.820]   in his open letter is um maybe maybe apple could do a little bit more
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:47.420]   socially conscious um activities with with some of its money instead of
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.540]   just helping the shareholders make more money
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:55.980]   and and i mean if you're just talking just take two billion away from the
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.420]   hundred billion but the shareholders are still happy they're still the
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.460]   largest buyback that that any corporation has ever done but
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:08.060]   just a little bit here and there isn't isn't hurting apple very much
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.620]   the assumption would be that they're not already doing some of those things now
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.420]   i will say that all corporations would benefit from
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.500]   doing more outreach so making making a difference in the world is a cheap
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.220]   way to for companies in my opinion to um build up their brand
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.940]   to get you know the um you know there's a i remember watching this is a decade
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.300]   ago i watched somebody talk about if if
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.980]   Chevrolet took its budget for advertising you know and took
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.500]   you know 10% of that budget and decided to push it towards
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.020]   um uh you know outreach you know they could literally have lunch with every
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.620]   person that bought a Chevrolet car you know you know a month later to find out
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.420]   how it how it goes and they could they could still and they still have a
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.900]   hundred million dollars to do all these other things and and the thing is is
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.620]   that the the warm fuzzies that we would get about Chevrolet
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.980]   would be at a whole different level in the same way with apple or google or
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.940]   facebook or all these people that are you know when you start when you're
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.660]   doing all those and a lot of these companies are
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.340]   spending a lot of money on making a difference i mean you know maybe not as
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.340]   loudly or as much money as they could but most of them are engaged in those
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.460]   things i think apple is probably one of the ones that is probably the most
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.580]   quietly engaged um they oftentimes when they're giving
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.100]   money away uh they're not they don't want their logo anywhere
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.020]   they don't want you know they they just want to help
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.220]   myer help things happen so when we think publicity point of view be great to
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.500]   make a big deal about it but i've always kind of been of the you know you
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.980]   don't let the left hand know what the right hand's doing
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.100]   attitude they you know that i've worked on events that apple has
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.300]   helped with yeah and no logos yeah no no no not apple speakers you know apple
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.140]   just thought that's doing good for doing good is
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.700]   mostly corporate benefit so i think that we don't i don't
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.940]   you're into but we're not conscious of it so you get romp neighbors in the
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.860]   future you know there's uh go ahead i think that's a i also think that's
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.780]   kind of a tone deaf comment for him to make i think that apple has demonstrated
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.820]   that uh they do better than almost every other
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.580]   company of its scale in terms of trying to treat its workers correctly
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.100]   they don't just simply put buffers between themselves and their labor
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.980]   force so that they can say oh well our contractor was supposed to
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.420]   ooh that contractor oh we're we're gonna give that to contractor
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.260]   Stern talking to let me tell you even though you know you're with the
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.980]   and the the trick of course is that these other companies
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.420]   they just simply say we will pay you twenty cents for this panel
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.180]   right and you figure it out and we insist that you pay you
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.220]   pay your workers at least five dollars an hour it's like no that doesn't work
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.500]   that way um i think that i mean especially when you have such a
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.740]   huge glowing target in the form of amazon where i'm starting to get
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.860]   i'm really concerned about what they're doing to the labor force
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:41.580]   it's it's it's starting to almost feel like one of the worst things that can
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.300]   happen to a community community is to have like an
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.100]   amazon warehouse in it it's great for the people who are
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.820]   ordering from amazon because they get really quick shipping
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.740]   but they just don't pay their workers ball they just don't treat their workers
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.860]   right they just don't get retention and so when they're getting all these tax
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.060]   breaks saying oh we're going to bring three thousand jobs into the community
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.460]   yeah but they're really terrible jobs it's
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.460]   that they're people that will take any job that so i i'm not saying that the
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.060]   people are foolish for taking them but i do think that amazon should be held to a
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.260]   higher standard that if they if certainly if
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.540]   maybe that's one of the reasons why they keep themselves i'm joking but
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.460]   if if they had if they had two hundred billion dollars worth of just cash on
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.500]   hand i think there'd be a lot more pointed yeah
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.980]   you really can afford to you really can afford to give health care to
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.660]   like most of your workers you really can afford to treat them
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.940]   right and not well look at wallmark i mean you really want to
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.060]   uh i try not to i think i think that i think that there's something about
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.420]   retailing that really begs people to do that kind of thing i guess
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.180]   well the the problem with the math over over time is that you know the
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.740]   warehouses are being run by people because they haven't got the machines
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.900]   working yet you know and and so and the you know i i one of the things that
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.020]   probably impacted me the most when i was my first job
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.060]   i was in shipping and receiving from electronics company
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:05.260]   and uh uh so i just packed gear all day and um uh there was a they moved our
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.980]   minimum wage i got paid i was getting paid three dollars
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:13.100]   and um fifty five cents uh a minimum wage at the time and they moved it to three
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.220]   seventy five and thirty people were fired
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.340]   so and the reason thirty people were fired was because there was this math
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.780]   of a surface mount um a surface mount machine
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.740]   that was gonna you know build all the circuit boards instead of people
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.460]   and the math was simply when it had to amortize over i don't know how many
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.380]   years two years or five years or whatever it was
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.820]   and as soon as they went over that they crested that number you know someone
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.060]   in the in the back office just said oh we hit it
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.020]   and boom they just they just bought the they bought the machine and it was like
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.580]   within weeks after the raise suddenly there were 30 people that lost their
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.620]   job so i i think because i saw it so early
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.460]   uh i've always remembered that there's the other side of of doing that is when
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.540]   you start ticking that number up you also create the incentive
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.980]   um you know we'll probably not have a mcdonald's 10 years from now that has
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.100]   more than four employees you know such a capitalist
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.100]   i'm not you know what's funny is i'm gonna get you a
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.620]   monocle in a monopoly i'm not i'm not i'm just a realist
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.900]   i'm a realist i think that i think that we just have to be careful of
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.660]   that there's there's there are it's easy for the outside to say oh you
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.620]   want to do this you want to do that and we do that i do that all the time to
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.980]   apple but uh we have to remember that apple's doing the
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:23.180]   you know i'm presumably and i try i think tim cook has a
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.380]   good heart yeah and i think that i think that i but i think that we just have to
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.620]   be careful of thinking that it's just sim it's a simple
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.660]   equation you know and and you know i i think that
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.940]   you know we've spent most of our free time in capital
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.900]   working in africa and all over the world you know um because i think that it
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.100]   makes a difference you know um but i think you know so i i
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.140]   i believe in trying to figure out ways to do that
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.660]   uh but i think that we also have to realize that when we say we're gonna
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.700]   you know those things seem like a simple solution and then and they never are
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.100]   and then people end up losing their jobs because we
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.140]   go down that path yeah i'm i'm not suggesting it's simple you're right
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.980]   uh but i think that there is always a way to treat uh
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.220]   low-level employees with dignity and i don't think that they consistently treat
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.180]   those employees with dignity and that's that's one of the problems that i
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.620]   have with wollmart as well when you have a consistent problem of
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.900]   someone being told to punch out but then come right back in
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.500]   and if you don't basically your reviews coming up that's
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.060]   that's criminal then that's and i think i think that there's a when someone
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.540]   when when the when somebody says that the best way to spend 130
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:30.220]   my 130 billion dollars is to do a space program
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.100]   you know i feel like there are a lot of other ways isn't that what uh that's
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.860]   what jeff bezo said isn't it he said uh i'm gonna take my lottery winnings from
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.500]   amazon at least he acknowledges that they're basically lottery winnings
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.460]   right and there's nothing else i could do with this that would be a value as
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.700]   me that speaks to a complete resignation in the value of the human race
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.260]   like no like like i feel like it's a separation
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.860]   it is a separation kind of nutty well but i think that it's a separation feeling
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.820]   like i can't help i can't fix anything we just take me a new plan i want to go
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:02.860]   somewhere else you know well okay can i i i have actually spoken to
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.140]   jeff bezos personally face-to-face about this
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:10.140]   and he's a believer in space he's not this is not giving up this is a
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:15.500]   the next step for humanity is to be able to do work in space and once we do work
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:20.620]   in space that means we can live in space so that's i do believe that he is he's
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.860]   a keeper of the faith when it comes to space trouble
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.700]   i also uh should point out sometimes we assume that these
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.580]   multi-billionaires and their vast fortunes which are vast for an individual
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.580]   are could make a significant difference in charity but you know governments put
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.900]   trillions of dollars i mean there's badly
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.540]   they may do it badly all right but but some but i mean i think that there
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.980]   there's that what what a few billion dollars can do is nice
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.380]   but it's not really as much as it might seem to be compared to
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.220]   you know the budgets of some of these big NGOs and i mean it's
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.100]   although i have to say what Bill Gates has done with his fortune seems to be
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.380]   quite well seems to be i don't know we're not experts on this stuff
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.300]   but the the only thing i'll say was because if i if i don't limited to one
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.020]   sentence it will be another path or of
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.820]   rattling but i think that part of it the central problem is when
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.180]   they try people try to put money into communities instead of
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.900]   putting wealth into communities instead of finding a way so that a certain
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.780]   group of people and to find them however you want
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:27.340]   are paid money for what they do and they get to keep that money in the form
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.900]   of property in the form of services in the form of
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.900]   giving that money buying products and services from other people within that
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.660]   community it's difficult to it's difficult when you see
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.260]   that you have a company that will go into a community
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.620]   essentially pay people as little as they can get away with which is okay
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.300]   commercialism that's that's perfectly fine but not a lot not build anything
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.660]   that adds wealth to this area adds wealth to this group of people
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.700]   and that's it's a i know it's a complicated problem we're building a
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.980]   cathedral whoever comes up with the right plan to solve it will not
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.820]   uh... live long enough to see his plan actually completed
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   but it's it's like like space travel is it's worth crazy people trying to work
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.380]   on this
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.780]   well and i think that micro like microfinance i think is a really
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.580]   interesting i agree you know i i i i do a lot of
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.620]   kevah is like one of my pastimes and um
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.500]   and it's just amazing that you have these you know these individuals who are
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:23.340]   trying to raise 750 dollars to make a huge yeah like it like you know you're
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.580]   changing a whole you know like and and uh
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.300]   you know getting those stories i think is it and i think that you know
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.300]   scaling that up is something that um i don't think you have to end malaria
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.900]   as the only thing that you're doing i think that uh and i think all of us
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.420]   um can be part of those kinds of things that's a good point
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.100]   let's take a break gotta get to that uh the big story
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.620]   the keyboard story in just a bit but first a word
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.780]   from zip recruiter now if you are like Alex Lindsey if you have a business
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:55.260]   or me you know that the employees are the most important part of your
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.620]   business every business needs great people
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:03.180]   and a better way to find them something better than just you know crossing
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.980]   your fingers and throwing the listing up on a couple of job
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.700]   sites you you know and hoping hoping somebody
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.900]   you'll see it you know if you've got an opening there's got to be the right
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.620]   person they're out there somewhere how do i reach them
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.820]   well zipper recruiter first of all when you post on zipper recruiter you're
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.340]   posting a hundred plus job sites with a single click so that's going to reach
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:27.900]   a maximum uh uh you know number of people out there
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.060]   give you a much better chance to get that right person
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.980]   but zip recruiter goes a little bit farther they they learn about what you're
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.980]   looking for they identify people in their database which has
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:42.540]   millions of resumes current resumes they identify people with the right
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.740]   experience and then they invite those people to apply for your job it's like
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:50.060]   it's like they're a headhunter helping you find the right person
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:55.100]   this has changed the way people hire 80 percent of employees i'm sorry
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:00.060]   employers who post a job on zipper recruiter get a quality employee through
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:05.020]   the site in just one day one day 80 percent
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.980]   get a quality candidate and zipper recruiter doesn't just stop there

[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.940]   laurie gill i have never asked you this question
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:58.060]   do you like the new mackintosh laptop keyboards are you a butterfly girl
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:02.780]   yes i am this is this is such an uncomfortable situation for me to be
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:08.300]   in i my i have the 2016 mikebook 13 inch mikebook pro with the touch bar and i
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.820]   have had zero complications with the keyboard
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.980]   but i know beyond a shadow of doubt there is something wrong with that
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.580]   keyboard went thousands of people have had issues with it so
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.220]   here i am recommending to my friends the new makbook pro and
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:28.780]   i'm watching person after person after person tell me that they've had
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.300]   some kind of breakdown with their keyboard that they had to take it in
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:37.020]   have something replaced take it in a second time had something else replaced
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:42.940]   it's it's dangerous territory here and i really think apple needs to address
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:49.420]   this i think the petition to recall the apple keyboard
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.500]   it's it's on the right path i i don't think the the
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.620]   the computer needs to be recalled but i think that
[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:05.260]   similar to the way apple released um a repair program for the apple the
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.900]   series one apple watch for the battery overheating and and
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:13.900]   breaking apart the battery kit the watch case it's something like this there
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.740]   needs to be it needs to be addressed apple needs to offer
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.460]   something to help people repair their keyboards and it has to extend well
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:27.820]   beyond any existing warranty so my mikebook pro is fine right now in
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:32.460]   2017 not even a year after i bought it but what's going to happen in four years
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:37.580]   five years is my matt keyboard gonna um have the same kind of issues
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.260]   and and i'm out of warranty and i have to pay seven hundred dollars to get it fixed
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.660]   that's part of the problem is how expensive right
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:47.900]   yeah you you have the butterfly one lorry the first
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.700]   generation uh which i tried and rejected and got rid of that exact
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.460]   laptop that you have i also didn't like the touch bar but that's another story
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.580]   for another day uh then i got the the next macbook which is butterfly two
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.380]   that was a little better i acknowledge that but still bugged me now apple
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.980]   insider uh actually went out and did some deep data
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:17.020]   diving uh they collected data from uh genius bars in the u.s which is
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.980]   interesting as well as apple authorized third party repair
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:26.220]   shops to collect the number of problems
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:30.700]   with number of keyboard incidents so the macbook pro
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:35.100]   which had the old-fashioned keyboard and the and the from 2014 and i'll put
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:41.260]   2015 in there we're talking 2120 incidents in 2014
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.100]   of them 118 were keyboard problems that's pretty good
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:52.860]   um in 2015 there were 1904 episodes and 114 keyboard incidents
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.900]   but then a big jump when you get to 20
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:02.940]   2016 you had fewer total incidents 1402 but a big jump in the number
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.860]   almost a 50% jump in the number of keyboard incidents
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.900]   um that seems to have settled down in 2017 but then these are
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.260]   newer computers we get the butterfly two-fisted
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.740]   yeah yeah but the with the class action suit
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.340]   it's i thought it was interesting that they there are two plaintiffs named
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.540]   one of which bought their macbook i think in 2016 2015
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.220]   but the other plaintiff bought theirs like this year they bought it in
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.420]   january and they had problems in april uh so
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:39.340]   which seems like good tactics they're it's
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.740]   i don't i made a note yesterday when i was reading the
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:47.580]   reading the complaint that i now i need to learn how class actions
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.580]   to spurt because one of the things that the suit is claiming is that
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.020]   not just that these are tricky these are problematic keyboards but they are
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.540]   fundamentally defective not only are they defective but apple knew that they
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.580]   were defective and that's part of the reasons why
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:05.500]   they're the the suit is going forward and i'm not sure how
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.580]   they're going to prove that because this isn't apple had a problem with uh
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:16.300]   like the the the the the smoking gun email to tim coke from 2016 saying
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.900]   these keyboards were having real problems with these before release
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.740]   something like that yeah it was just like that or slim i would guess if the
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.860]   old old timers like me i remember the the twiggy uh
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.020]   floppy drives the original lisa that was where apple they were they were so
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.700]   determined not to go with another but they're so determined to go with an
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.060]   in-house solution that and they could not get the damn thing to work
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:41.580]   and they had to ship on time and so there's there are all kinds of legal
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.300]   issues afterwards because they could prove that they knew the thing just
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.860]   didn't work properly but they had made made the ship date so i don't know i
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   i i i agree with laurie i think that uh i don't think that we need a we
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.620]   necessarily need a a recall because again that assumes that the entire
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.260]   design is defective i don't think that's the case at all
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:03.420]   uh but a warranty extension i think is exactly what is called for here
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.380]   just and they don't have to they don't have to have a big maya culpa they don't
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.420]   have to say anything they don't have to advertise anything but if you come in
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.300]   with a keyboard with a problem yes the first time you bring it in they're
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.260]   going to spritz it with the with the compressed air like they like the service
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.700]   note says but if it's clear that you if you come back again they're just gonna
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.020]   swap out a brand new keyboard and not charge you for it i had a i had a
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:26.780]   this this is why it's always worth it to bring a problem a problematic
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.300]   apple product back to the apple store even if it's out of warranty
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:35.020]   uh i you had my uh uh my macbook probe uh 2015
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   obviously it's like out of warranty by two years uh and i got the after
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.420]   lots of lots of use i got what i thought was a normal
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.700]   overplace the their battery is finally bad replace it
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.580]   uh and i thought that i thought that okay old age i've been using it over and
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.300]   over and i was going to pay to replace the batteries not going to cost that
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.140]   much money but they took they took it in the back and they realized that like
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.660]   a couple of cells were swollen and they replaced the battery for free
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.540]   so again it's not something that was advertised but it's always worth it
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.460]   just to see if they'll do something for you under their we're awesome policy
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.100]   and this is if there's ever a time for apple to be awesome
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:11.180]   it's to make people should make convince people that if they have a
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:14.940]   keyboard with a problem it's not going to cost them $700 to fix it because
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:19.660]   for 700 bucks you can probably get a windows laptop with a good with a much
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:24.060]   better keyboard we actually point out that rene richie was the guy who put
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.220]   these numbers together i think apple insider published
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:31.020]   percentages mostly and the total number of incidents is not the total number
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.460]   across the board just the ones that apple insider counted what's relevant is the
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.660]   percentage of the total incidence that were keyboard
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.700]   incidents and that went did go up a lot in 2016
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.340]   but nevertheless even if it's 12 or 13 percent of overall
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.220]   that that is not uh that does not rise to the level of oh my god
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:54.380]   this thing is broken so it is really more of a good i think it's going to be
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.300]   more of a good will why and i think that they have to convince apple of
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.220]   then of any of any failing i mean that's a small number
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.940]   well good good will doesn't pay for lawyers
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.980]   yeah the lawyers are going to want to know what well see what i'd like to see is the
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.180]   outcome is apple rethinking the butterfly switch
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.140]   i think they'd be making a better keyboard next time i would like to just
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.300]   get rid of the keyboard like i i love the ipad like literally get rid of the keyboard
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.980]   just like everything would be a l s no no no no no no i was if you look at like
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.700]   a surface the surface is great because you choose choose what you want you know
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.260]   like like that that way andi and i can have big
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.980]   keys and then other people can have butterfly keys and
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.860]   you just attach it to the to the thing and put it together it could still be
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.340]   mac os i don't want to get by the way i say i'm realistic that i don't think
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.700]   mac os is gonna last forever i don't want to give it up because i still
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.260]   i love mac os 90 percent of my time me too that i spend on a mac or on an apple
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.340]   device is in front of a mac the petition it changed out org hasn't
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:54.620]   quite raised 25 000 signatures um i i don't know how many millions of
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   these they've sold but that's not a huge number
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:02.060]   uh also i mean who people like people like deciding electronically
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.980]   petition that that means nothing that does anything but but i do think but
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.500]   we've just we've heard too much about we've heard from too many people who've
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.100]   had these problems to think that okay well you know there was a
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.860]   a fly got into the transporter chamber was a one one in a million problem
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.540]   i think that there is a there is a weakness i think it's been demonstrated
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.260]   there's a weakness to this keyboard that makes them
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.580]   so once they go bad they're just bad and you're just not gonna there's no way
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.060]   to really get pop off that keycap get in there with a q-tip and an isopropyl
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.340]   and get that key switch working properly i mean i think the physics of it are
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:39.660]   obvious is that is it when you have less uh travel it's going to be much more
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.540]   sensitive to anything that goes wrong you know i think that the physics of it
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.900]   it just just makes sense that the thinner these keys get and the less
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.100]   travel they're going to have when you hit them the the less reliable they're
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:54.380]   going to be you know so i think that um and i think it's easier to have
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.180]   grit and all kinds of other stuff i mean i know some people that just go through
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.380]   keyboards because they because they use them outside you know like they
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.340]   use them in construction sites and so they you know so it's you know they and
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.300]   they go through certain ones faster because of that i don't i don't know
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.660]   which device i can shake more crumbs out of the tray at the bottom of my
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.980]   coaster oven or my my laptop keyboard so it's it's a tough problem to solve i
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:18.220]   don't think i don't think that that apple engineers have been lazy i just
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.500]   think it's a big problem i still really need to get a keyboard that doesn't
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.340]   have any kind of holes in it at all right what is
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.180]   you know that's uh like i'm like a membrane keyboard yeah for your
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:34.060]   not yet it feels super mushy but i'm using it right now on
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.540]   purpose to kind of test out like how it feels to not have any kind of
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.940]   springback so i really like travel i mean i ended up buying
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:48.140]   a couple of Lenovo laptops and i'm still my main Mac uh
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:51.820]   laptop is a 2050 is the 2015 i think there are a lot of people
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.540]   you know that's the number apple should really look at is how many people are
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.420]   buying a super annuated computer from apple
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.900]   they still sell it uh if people still if that 2015 15 inches
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.500]   selling well that's a signal more than anything else to apple that people
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.820]   want that keyboard right there's a lot of reasons for it it's not just
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.780]   the key man has connectors okay can you're using it i'm still
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.420]   you're connectors and better keyboard that's
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.620]   good i'm assuming that's part of the key the reason the keyboard the
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:23.420]   butterfly keyboard on the 2016 and newer has to do with the thickness of the
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:27.100]   Mac which i think is one of the biggest selling points for apple is that they're
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.660]   their macbook pro is actually thinner than their macbook air and lighter than
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.460]   their macbook air and and so then how do you fix that how do you
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.220]   how do you sort of champion the thinnest to lightest
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:45.020]   laptop and then put back a keyboard that that adds weight and size to it
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.460]   well i think the question is do pros care that it's thinner
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:52.380]   and i don't think that they apple cares a little too much i think that
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.060]   and how many millimeters would they need to add to give it some decent travel
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.580]   model a couple three millimeters a lot of us that are pros still
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.020]   with still miss our 17 inch i mean we would be happy with having
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.340]   thicker every time we talk about this there's there are people in the
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.460]   chair and say well forget that let's have a 17 i mean the
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.300]   the 12 i mean the uh having a little thicker last
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   have more travel in the keys and more battery most of almost every pro that i
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.380]   know would happily happily do that you know i think that the the you know i
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.740]   think it's fine to have macbooks that are super thin for business types that
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.180]   don't care i just want to be super thin and make it easy for them to throw in
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.380]   but for people who are actually pro creative pros
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.740]   having it to be a little thicker with more travel and more battery would be
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.540]   huge and better yet a battery that i could pull out
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:40.780]   not that i'm better i wonder i wonder i'm really i'm
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.260]   apples kept this 15 inch because a lot of us are still buying them and i'm
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.780]   and i've got a wonder i mean doesn't have a touch bar it has connectors and it
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:52.460]   has a better keyboard but it's but it's a four-year-old processor it's a
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:56.540]   haswell processor i really wonder if this
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.860]   i mean it's two thousand dollars does it sell well if it sold well that would be
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.860]   a strong signal i don't think they get rid of it if it
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.420]   wasn't still and they're still it's still on the site
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:09.260]   must sell well that's but isn't that typical we're whenever they do a major
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.220]   rev like like when they came up the when the first
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:17.100]   macbook that deleted the dvd uh the the optical drive they kept the last
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.460]   model of macbook that had the optical drive on the price list
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.820]   because it is a pro-level model there people who are still gonna buy them
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.300]   um i don't know the exact metrics are but once there's it's a big motivator
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.180]   once you've been selling in manufacturing something for a few years
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.340]   you've got all the tooling you've got all you've got parts of the
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.900]   inventory that you got to get rid of you're not gonna you're not gonna
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:39.020]   sell it to the to an outlet outlet store for the the dollar store
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.500]   so you may as well keep them around and take whatever money you're gonna get
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.740]   for them
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:50.300]   so um mr carrman john groover jason snell kasey jonston a lot of big
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.620]   names uh have said you know this is a mistake groover said uh this is one of
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.860]   the biggest design scripts in apple history i think that's a little strong
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.580]   but uh
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.180]   marco armant butterfly key switches are a design failure they're
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.340]   fatally unreliable you don't even have to look to the
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.260]   the professionals and the analysts to see that for for the
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:18.220]   fifteen or twenty macbook pro owners that i know
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.460]   six or seven of them have had two bordishes really it's it's
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.220]   you know the it's clearly an issue you don't have to
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.500]   you don't have to believe the the pros on this you just ask
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.100]   your friends around town and see how many of them
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:39.180]   comment on on having a keyboard issue where they actually had to take it into
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.540]   an apple store and have something done to it i would love to be able to say
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.820]   your long nightmares almost over june fourth
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:52.700]   tim cook will come on stage ww dc and announce new laptops a macbook with a
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:59.740]   great keyboard won't we'll see two or three weeks right
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.340]   they'll say but if they ever do they're gonna they're gonna couch it in terms of
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.580]   we've taken everything we've learned about the super flat
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.300]   butterfly keys that everybody loves and we've used it to create the second
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.380]   generation that that has okay now two millimeters of traveling up point
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.580]   five two but the point is we weren't wrong we were never wrong
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:24.140]   well no no we're never wrong uh earlier today we did the
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:29.500]   ios today and uh um megan maroney said she really wanted these new spiking
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.740]   cases to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the iMac a bondi blue
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:38.940]   iPhone 10 case how about that huh or a case that makes your iPhone 10
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:44.380]   look just like the iPhone one giant anion iphone one that's kind of fun
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.980]   isn't it pretty it's kind of pretty kind of pretty i kind of like it
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.220]   every time every time every time i see on ebay where somebody
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.020]   got a hold of like an old mac that had like a clear plastic case on it
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.340]   that's the one i want if you're possible to like and i'm sure that if you go to
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.260]   certain markets in china someone will sell you like a replacement
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:07.260]   backcase for your for your uh for an iphone that is just simply clear
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.140]   plastic i would i would buy the i would almost switch back to the iphone
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:18.700]   if i could buy a clear clear back iphone that is hot yeah w yeah so this has
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.540]   kind of the markings that you know kind of to simulate the inside of the
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.620]   iphone like the uh bondi blue is kind of transparent i think that's very clever
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:32.220]   i like it yeah that's cool yeah uh let's see we're we're coming down to the uh
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:39.100]   the end of the line on some of these um eddy q put his lake tahoe vacation
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.100]   home on sale do you care no it's really nice is it do you see the pictures
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.740]   oh well maybe now we have to go look okay all right
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:50.380]   the only thing i noticed about the um the home with if you look at the interior
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.660]   image it's it's a little difficult but isn't that reney richy's living room wall
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.700]   pattern oh it is my god it's the river stone look
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.380]   yeah this is that's a little too modern for me that was one of his little day trips
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.820]   he's like he saw the stuff like just stacked up on the driveway so oh you know
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.940]   those are the extras why you want nice material use though i like the materials
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:17.580]   in this it's pretty wood floor but uh yeah yeah isn't it like what is it like
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:22.220]   eleven million dollars that's all come on lory it's down the road from you
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:25.820]   okay but that's like that's like bay area money that could be a two-bedroom
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:29.660]   with like half a bath shared bathroom with the next door right yeah
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:35.420]   where you have to have six roommates it's on it's on marty's camp a development
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.780]   where people can golf and ski all year has a private chairlift to north star
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:46.700]   how about that it's not bad do you do you ski lory i don't i don't i tried a
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.700]   couple times it failed miserably yeah me neither
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:55.420]   uh the only the only time i've ever skied is like in downtown albany while i was
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.940]   while i was in school there's a while i was in college there's a there's a
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.380]   steep steep like street that goes to the capital building and for some reason
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.220]   they shut the street down so there could be like free downhill skiing
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.700]   if you're the only time ever gonna stay as private
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:13.820]   ski less you you bought the land for a 1.2 million in 2010
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.940]   and took 15 years to develop it fully so he's been this has been a long project
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.780]   to the connectivity in there is awesome yeah yeah
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.060]   if i you know if i lived in the bay area one of my favorite weekend hobbies would
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.580]   be going to like open houses of people who work at apple and google
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.900]   just to see what their how their design aesthetic for device is translates to
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.500]   how that's interesting that would be a good article
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:41.020]   lory get to work on it all right i'd be a good article
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:44.860]   with it would be one of the apple designers have had
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.980]   that would be a fun thing to do some research on
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.820]   tim cook graduate a graduate commencement address
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:59.260]   at duke his alma mater and uh he challenged students to
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:04.780]   think different rather than accept the status quo leave the world a better
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.780]   place following in the footsteps of steve jobs
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:12.060]   robert fkinen and martin luther king he also
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.180]   talked about apples commitment to environment privacy immigration and
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.980]   gun control supporting the me to movement against sexual harassment
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:24.300]   and students involved in the stoneman douglas high school shooting
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:28.780]   um i don't always see life as clearly as i do today says cook
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.220]   but i've learned the greatest challenge of life is knowing when to break with
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.700]   conventional wisdom don't just accept the world you inherit today don't just
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:40.220]   accept the status quo no big challenge has ever been solved
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.580]   no lasting improvement has ever been achieved unless people dare to try
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:49.740]   something different dare to think different i have to say
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.980]   as as beautiful as the speech is there's a lot of
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   isn't apple great for what it's done being done in this speech and if that
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.900]   were my graduation i would have been rolling my eyes at this
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.940]   at this sort of advertisement for the company
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.820]   use offer use offer code tim duke two o nade
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.180]   to get five percent off of accessories and cables
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.740]   all right time for break in our picks of the week
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.020]   larry gill is here laura you can do anything remember
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.220]   you you could be like jim dallerimple and recommend rock and roll what
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.260]   last time you're here you recommend something like a movie right
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.860]   you did you recommended the third in that series of which movies
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.740]   this is theory of yeah actually i think it was um
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.940]   the mother of tears is the one i heard of tears you did
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.060]   and that got me all excited about a whole new thing
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.780]   so i can't wait to hear what you've got for us
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.940]   and it may not be as exciting this time oh come on lory
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:48.380]   and i got a i got a box i got two boxes from amazon right before the show
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.060]   i'll show off something new too
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:58.940]   but first a word from fresh books stream we're talking to small business again
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:04.220]   streamline your operations with fresh books i did back in 2004 i started
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.220]   using fresh books because uh i love doing what i do
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.860]   i hate sending invoices at the end of the
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:14.540]   month i just hated firing up microsoft word and excel and
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.300]   i was invoicing a canadian company because i was going up there to do a tv
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.580]   show for rogers and i had to figure out the
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.340]   different right the you know canadian dollars and
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.940]   get all my expenses together oh it's just a pain
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.780]   but then amber macarthur told me about fresh books and i
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:37.420]   did just change my life it made it so much easier i could make beautiful invoices
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.100]   easy as pie it handled the currency conversions no problem
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.700]   snap a picture with the fresh books app of my receipts automatically put them
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:50.140]   right into the fresh books invoice now for i have to say in the
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.500]   lat in the interviewing 15 years fresh books
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.700]   first of all has gained millions of customers i think there's 10 million
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:01.100]   people now who use fresh books every single month to send invoices
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:05.660]   you can track time if you build by hours you could capture expenses
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.780]   but it because fresh books is an online app
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.140]   it's getting better every week you go and something new is there
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.540]   it really has become cloud accounting without having to do any accounting
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.820]   you can quickly access reports like outstanding balances
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:23.980]   total profit that's something a lot of freelancers never know am i making
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:28.060]   money not till the end of the year anyway keep tabs in your business no matter
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.420]   where you are with the fresh books mobile app they've got one for ios and
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:35.500]   android they automatically will connect up to your bank account and update

[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.100]   with the csv file import option take a picture of receipt
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.980]   so there's lots of ways to get your data in there
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.820]   if you've got a team if you're not an i was alone on to loan on to prudur alone
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.900]   uh freelancer but if you've got a team you'll appreciate the team features there's
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.100]   a my team page you can add team members on various
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:01.340]   permissions levels now you can create proposals right within fresh books
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:07.500]   rich text images request your clients e signature as they accept proposals
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.100]   and of course track all of your non-invoice income as well like online
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:15.820]   sales and ads so it's all in there and by the way
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.020]   when it comes to invoices nobody does it better than fresh books you don't have to
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.820]   chase your clients for payment you can accept online payments
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.900]   directly in that invoice which means your clients can pay you
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:30.220]   like with a credit card or online that means you're going to get paid on average
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:35.500]   two times faster bill for time by client specific projects and invoices
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.660]   estimates and proposals in many languages they just added spanish
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:43.740]   dutch german and porcheese they have also announced this is brand new a
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.340]   collaboration with microsoft which rolls out this summer
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:51.180]   which means fresh books will work in your outlook
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.100]   so you can view and pay fresh books invoices view and pay
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.980]   fresh books invoices regardless of what device
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.180]   you view it from with microsoft outlook payments
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.260]   that's going to even make it easier outlook users will be able to view invoices
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.060]   in their email click a button that says pay now
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.380]   most of your clients use outlook i promise you
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.500]   and if your credit card is registered without like payments you can pay in one
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.420]   click

[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.380]   for changing my life 14 years ago and maybe changing yours too
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:38.700]   and supporting mac break weekly all right lori i gotta hear it what do you
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.460]   got
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:45.500]   my we my pick this week is the oculus go
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.980]   i have something that goes with that for my pick
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:53.260]   so this is the standalone oculus now did you have you tried the original oculus
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.460]   rift can you compare it i have only
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.620]   just tested it when i was at gdc i haven't owned it and i've not used it for
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.300]   more than a few minutes at a time but that being said what i need to
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:09.100]   say about oculus go it's not that it's the best or greatest it's
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.300]   actually not it's actually pales in comparison to the rift
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:18.060]   but it is the vr headset for people who are just getting into vr it's the every
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.260]   man's headset i am loving this it's only two hundred
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.900]   dollars two hundred and fifty if you get the larger
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:28.380]   software it's easy to navigate it doesn't have a lot of extra bills and
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.340]   whistles that are confusing you're not plugged into a computer you don't need
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.500]   a special phone to be able to get it to work you don't need to have a special
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:40.460]   setup it's perfect for someone like me who has always wanted to get into vr
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.660]   but wasn't willing to spend five hundred dollars on a device
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:48.620]   and have to upgrade to a computer that could actually support it so that's why
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.820]   this is my pick not because it's the best device because it's not
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:55.740]   but because it's the best device for people who are just starting out with
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:00.700]   the r so you don't have to put a phone in it it's completely all in one
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.820]   that's correct yeah that's good for two hundred bucks that's impressive
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:08.540]   actually you have to have a a smartphone in order to you have to have a
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.420]   companion app so that helps you with the setup
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.860]   so for anybody out there who only has a flip phone or
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.580]   a sidekick you do need a smartphone in order to get it set up but once you've
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.020]   got it set up you don't use a phone anymore after that so
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.420]   what's your favorite app what do you like to do
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:33.740]   um i've been playing um the uh land's end which is the same um game company that
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:38.380]   made uh monument valley i got i'm glad i remembered that
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.860]   oh i love the monument valley that's a great game
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:44.700]   it's another puzzle game but you're actually in vr doing it so it's much
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:48.300]   more immersive i found myself getting just a tiny bit
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:53.100]   motion to stick from that particular one so um i only do it about 10 or 15
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.820]   minutes at a time um i've also missed around with the
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:00.220]   plex app which is fantastic in vr um so you
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.340]   lie in well you lie in your back and watch tv
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:07.100]   yeah you can you can lie in your back you can sit on the couch you can yeah
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.780]   you can be anywhere your your significant other can be
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.220]   watching one movie on you know Netflix on the big screen and you
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:18.620]   can be watching another movie in hulu on your tiny version of a big screen
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:21.660]   which has happened a lot in the lorry gill household
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:25.340]   no usually i'm playing video games
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:30.700]   um what what's cool about vr uh movie watching
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.580]   is it's you really do feel like you're watching the big screen even when
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:39.500]   it's just this tiny little thing that's right in front of your eyes you get a
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.860]   sense of scale that that doesn't fit with the reality but
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.180]   your brain is processing it as you're as a very big screen tv that you're
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:50.540]   watching so it's a really fun experience and the go is a higher resolution in
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:54.620]   the rift so you should that that movie resolution it's got a lower frame rate
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:59.180]   but a higher resolution so you're but but it's a much higher resolution the go
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:03.820]   is much higher resolution than Netflix or or plex so you're seeing so you'll see
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.180]   it's fine door at all like can you see the pixel glory
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:10.940]   there there is a little bit of that it's usually just around the peripheral
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.100]   okay um so for me being new to vr i'm still learning
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.580]   how to not look up like this but to actually look up like this
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:23.260]   oh god get that better frame don't move your eyes move your whole face your
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:26.620]   whole head right yeah so it's i i see it a little
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.060]   but i'm it's i think it's because i'm still learning how to properly navigate
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:36.220]   inside vr which it's it's not bad how does uh i wear glasses i i guess i
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.500]   could do it with context but i would prefer to wear my glasses at night
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:44.780]   it actually comes with it comes with a um i i don't wear glasses so i don't
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:48.220]   know exactly how it works but it comes with this little rubber
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.180]   thing that goes around the inside of the offset
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:56.940]   supposedly uh it helps with the um the the glasses wearing again i don't wear
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.140]   glasses so i don't know what that's like or whether it's comfortable or not
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.180]   it's such a bummer that's the biggest that's like when i have context in i
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.820]   love doing oculic yeah but i don't want to wear context when i'm
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.860]   watching movies at night you know i don't mind for
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.140]   at work but i take them out at night i want to wear my glasses you can get your
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.580]   glasses there's i find that with the rift at least there's like this wrestling
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.380]   thing that happens yeah your glasses then you can kind of like get them in on and
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.260]   then you have to get your glasses kind of in the right place and
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:24.940]   and um i would i would just replay you can get lenses for your
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:29.660]   you know for your rift oh um yeah but my problem is is my son and i
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:33.020]   and my daughter we all use it so it's a little more complicated like lenses you
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.460]   put over the regular screen you get that's kind of interesting
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:40.140]   so if they have that for go you could actually get one for each person in
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.060]   the family because they're only two hundred dollars yeah
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:46.940]   and the glasses are only four hundred dollars right exactly cool oculus go
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:51.660]   two hundred dollars thank you lory and an echo what do you
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:58.140]   got for us oh you're muted is that us or is that you
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:05.500]   he's pointing at himself sorry about that no problem uh i i muted my microphone
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.740]   because we were talking about uh apples like
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:14.140]   apple recalls and realized that while unpacking boxes i came apart i came
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.460]   across a part of apple history this is an actual twiggy drive
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:24.620]   oh my god wow wow so this was because as part of the settlement
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.980]   they they what apple as part of the settlement these
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.380]   worked so badly that apple was forced to like if you if you had like an original
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.020]   lisa with these two defective twiggy drives you could just take the machine
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:42.220]   in they would swap you for a brand new swap swap you for like a mac excel or the
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:46.460]   upgraded lisa that uses the max style discs and they wound up with like all
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:51.260]   a whole bunch of these poles and ages and ages and ages ago
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:56.300]   like i someone just who was in a service bay asked if i wanted one and i said
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.940]   hell yeah i want one uh and they're dated
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:03.820]   dated uh look at that wow now did he give you one of the twiggy floppies to go
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.940]   along with it no but it's been sort of on my list
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.420]   unfortunately i put it off for so long that now they're
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.380]   actually cost because they're flawed they're fatal flawless
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:15.820]   the opening for the floppy is right where your thumb goes when you put it
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:20.780]   yeah and there was no and yeah it was uh that was like that was a certain
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:24.860]   comedy of errors that's why that's why anytime someone says that the apple
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.900]   keyboard is defective let's have a sense of perspective
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.900]   this was this was yeah either rude words you would have to
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.740]   rhyme with in order to describe how badly twiggy drive was but yes this is a
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.220]   static art display which is the best way to use a
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:41.420]   trick twiggy drive to just simply just observe it
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:46.620]   academically don't don't actually put any floppies or data on it
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:50.140]   as a static object it works really really well that
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.660]   response it displaces air and it responds to gravity
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.100]   oh and of course the twiggy discs were in
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:02.220]   looked exactly like standard floppy disks but were completely incompatible
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:06.300]   because they had holes in both sides which is weird
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.100]   yeah there's they're trying to get more data on there and so they're using a
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:13.340]   bunch of screwy ideas and it was though it was it's a classic case of the not
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.620]   invented here syndrome which is that yes because
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.060]   we could look to companies that do nothing but build
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:25.820]   data storage systems to build something for us or hell we've got engineers
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:31.260]   well it did it did have it's uh the was drive controller I think on it right
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:35.900]   that was pretty impressive i'm looking for something with a glow of elegance
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:40.220]   and glory about it i thought to look closer
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.620]   is that your pick everybody should run out and get a twiggy drive i don't
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:48.220]   i don't even know how much actually one of the reasons why it not only is it
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:53.180]   cool that made the pick but like i saw someone like sell a twiggy like lisa
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:57.420]   for like 40 000 dollars this has got to be worth i don't know like a burrito with
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:01.660]   guacamole at least but no my actual
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:07.580]   my actual pick is a new tv i got last week i actually was in the background
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:12.380]   because it was in my office last week this is the tcl series six
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:17.100]   uh 4k hdrtv did you get the best by deal of 500
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.620]   dollars for the 55 inch no that was that was for last year's
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.460]   model oh this is a model that i had been
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:28.460]   sort of like waiting patiently on this this is this is my demonstration to
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:32.780]   myself that i can i i am not eight years old anymore if you
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.620]   offer me two marshmallows if i wait now or or one marshmallow now i am
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:40.300]   capable of waiting for the two marshmallows because this is the 2017
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:44.460]   model of this was one of the best reviewed tv's ever as matter of fact
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:49.340]   uh i think the wire cutter named it as its best pick for a budget tv but also
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.340]   its best best pick for a 4k hdrtv all told
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:59.420]   and this new version is better it says more contrast zones it has better
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.940]   build quality a bunch of other things that i'm still
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:06.700]   factoring on but it's it's a perfect tv for someone
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:12.220]   like me where i bought a i it replaces a tv i bought 10 years ago
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.980]   i had been it's now at the the old tv is the point where like the
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.060]   the fluorescent illuminator is starting to like make this halo sort of effect
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:24.940]   in the middle of this middle of the tv also i have weight i've i've successfully
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:29.420]   weighted out every single fad so i didn't buy i didn't buy a new tv
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:34.460]   before you needed to get the new 4k hdmi for content control i didn't buy
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:39.900]   a new tv with a with a curved screen or 3d i didn't even buy a 4k tv when there
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.780]   was hdr but they hadn't figured out that we're going to have to have two
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.580]   standards in order to be compatible with all the content
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.420]   so i wound up for for 650 bucks which is damn cheap
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.660]   of what you're getting what i think is a reference model tv
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.620]   uh not in this not in the sense that if you you know if you're doing if you
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:59.900]   spend thousands of dollars in a home theater why don't throw money away for
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:02.860]   anything more expensive of this but i'm saying that this is a list of all the
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:05.180]   features that are going to be important for the next 10 years
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:09.260]   if you're not the sort of person that goes into the showroom with a colorometer
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:12.940]   to check for every single corner for illumination and color balance
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:16.060]   you just simply want something that is really really good
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.780]   that has every feature you're going to want you can get 10 years worth of
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:22.700]   use out of and you're there's just something about you that says i can't
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:26.780]   spend more than a thousand bucks on a tv or else my the spirit of my father
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:30.700]   will just haunt me for a long long time and he will not be pleased with me
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:34.860]   um so i thought i've had in the office for about half a week then i put in
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.540]   living room a few days ago um i had that wonderful experience where i
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:42.780]   started looking for 4k HDR content on netflix and wound up spending a day and
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.540]   a half just watching television because it's like
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:50.300]   it's for someone who's been using a standard hd tv for 10 years
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.300]   and i've only had 4k temporarily and not really just as a
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.340]   you know only in a like a test environment for a few days
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:01.580]   it really is an amazing upgrade you will feel every dollar that you spent on
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:05.340]   this upgrade and i'm very happy with it so far the only
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.140]   the only bad things i could say about it so far
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:13.020]   are that if you go looking for uh dark spots
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:16.140]   you will certainly find them in the very very corners of the screen that the
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.620]   illumination is not 100 percent consistent
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.660]   but it's the sort of thing where you have to have the brightness up and you
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.820]   have to really look for it in order to find it
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:29.100]   i don't find it distracting at all um i'm sure that uh if there's anything
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.740]   bad it's going to happen it's going to happen in the next two or three weeks
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:35.820]   but the first week report is good enough that i can recommend it
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.380]   like i said it's just such a terrific value
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:42.540]   against not for people who wouldn't blink at spending three thousand dollars
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.940]   on the absolute greatest set that's out there
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:49.340]   but i'm damned if i can think of any way that this tv has cut a corner
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:53.180]   or it feels cheap in any way again all all the hd
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:59.180]   multiple h&m i ports it has a roku built in that's compatible with 4k and hdr
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.660]   so you don't even have to plug it into uh an apple tv or anything else
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:07.100]   has ethernet in again everything i would want to plug into it i can plug into
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:11.100]   it uh and like i said i'm just really really happy with it
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:14.700]   actually you'll be happy to know that scott wilkinson our home theater guy
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:18.780]   uh highly recommends these tv's he says they're second really only to
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.980]   the oled tv's it cost as you know a lot lot more
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.740]   it's got it's got roku built in which is fantastic
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:30.940]   uh he and his 4k uhd supports stolby vision hdr
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.220]   it's a pretty nice tv both kind of hdr 10 and delvi vision so
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.700]   oh both so that's nice you're covered you're covered either way
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.700]   it has uh the 55 inch version has like 96 contrast zones
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.860]   which is an upgrade from last year oh yeah it uses
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.140]   fault i don't know how many of these were on amazon but i just want to let you
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.420]   know that when i logged in when you started the rep when you started this
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.540]   it was available for one that you know available to ship or whatever to
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.380]   schedule or whatever and it's now temporarily out of
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   stomach yeah yeah there's like 650 bucks for the 55
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.620]   flying off the shelves yeah and again it's it's exactly the
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:05.660]   amount of all the backlighting is a very good way to do it the
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.500]   local array dimming so this is a thousand dollars for a 65 inch
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:14.300]   hdr 4k is unbelievable insane i i i did have one of those moments
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.900]   as i was like first when i was unpacking it and setting it up in the office and
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.940]   then like when i moved it from the office into the living room
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.380]   it's like i wonder what my i wonder what 10 year old me would think
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:29.340]   say oh by the way not only do you have a 55 inch tv that's as good as a movie
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.540]   screen you just sort of like picked it up
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:35.820]   i had carried it and and when it's pretty amazing isn't it
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:38.220]   and there was a point which you were shifting so you're actually kind of
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:41.580]   lifted cold supporting its entire weight with only one hand as you're shifting
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.700]   it around pretty amazing i think you would require a lot of explanation about
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:49.660]   or wonder if i got exposed to gamma rays but what a wonderful what a wonderful
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:54.620]   2018 it is that i get it would cost it would cost me more money to buy
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.860]   smaller than a 55 inch tv almost it would cost me more money to get a
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:04.300]   lesser tv it's really cool yeah tclusa.com it's a Chinese company
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:07.820]   that is i think aggressively pursuing the u.s market which might explain
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:11.020]   why the price is just be just be a little bit careful again there's a
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:15.260]   2017 model that's now being discounted that's what i think Leo you're talking
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.740]   about earlier this by having discounted for 500 bucks
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:22.300]   that was the one where i've been saving like i keep everyone knows that
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:26.620]   on black friday on amazon i do like spend a week
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.740]   essentially turning my twitter feed almost into the home shop and network but
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:32.540]   only for stuff that i actually own and actually can recommend
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:35.420]   and the reason why is that i if i know that next year i'm gonna
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.660]   that this is the year that i want to replace a tv
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.660]   it's like i'm using the amazon credits i get to buy a new tv
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:45.020]   and i've been after seeing the ces report i knew
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.260]   at 2018 i knew that this is the one i was going to get
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:52.140]   and i could have gotten the 2017 model like and waiting month after month
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:55.580]   after month saying no they're back in stock oh those are 50 dollars off
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.700]   like no wait wait for your two marshmallows Andy
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:01.580]   i know the one marshmallows are delicious now
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.940]   but if you can wait till may you will have two marshmallows and now i'm
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:09.500]   happy with my two marshmallows very nice excellent recommendation
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:12.860]   Alex Lindsay what do you got i have a show that i'm
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.060]   recommending a show some people have seen this show but
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.940]   i want to make sure that everybody's seen this show because it is just
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:23.500]   so i always bring a new show have you have you been watching chef's table

[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.340]   yeah so incredibly well shot so like it just just
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.740]   you know it's like is like netflix gave uh
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:46.220]   i can't um a glab i can't think of his first name right now but but gave the
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:49.180]   director from hero dreams of sushi just like okay now we'll get you the
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.140]   second one same guy same guy so they just let him

[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:19.900]   um and it's about people who are in just incredible they're these artists
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:23.500]   with food and this the last episode i'm not i don't
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.340]   eat a lot of desserts so i don't i don't i wasn't as as excited about it but the
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:30.780]   first three seasons are all just about these cooks all over the world
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:35.660]   and um and it's just incredible stories of how they were successful how they
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:39.020]   failed and came back up how they somehow found their way there's there's one
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.540]   about a a guy from new york who ended up in
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:46.300]   japan and now he's got this great ramen you know restaurant and
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:50.380]   and uh incredible one about a you know a great chef and most of these are
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.420]   michelan you know three star you know right three star and michelan
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:57.100]   restaurants half hour two which is nice are they are are they longer or longer
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.420]   than maybe the dessert ones are shorter but the
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:02.940]   normally they're 45 minutes or 50 minutes still not really lengthy
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:07.500]   the soup kind of a perfect emo's bush before you dig right into west world
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.700]   or something like that i love you know and you look at it going oh i don't know
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.020]   which one i should get dunex and then you realize that they're all just
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.060]   amazing and and really inspiring not just on the
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:20.380]   level of food but on a level of just um incredible artists being artists
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.940]   about and food happens to be the thing that they um that they that they do
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:28.940]   and just these you know intense guys that are really and and women men men
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.900]   and women that are um really into this this art form called
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:39.420]   cooking you know and uh what i love about it also though is that it is a
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:42.780]   it's a testament to what is great about the media market right now that that
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:47.900]   this is not something that you'd see in most cable or tv or whatever
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:53.420]   this is a odd niche market that netflix invested in um wisely i think
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:58.540]   um because it's and it's these kinds of uh verticals that i think that um
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:03.420]   are just just amazing um and it's just it's but it's just one of the best
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:07.660]   shot documentary series um i've ever uh
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.660]   um i've ever seen i can't wait so anyway i had fantasies when i was
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:16.140]   it's 4k HDR is two isn't it oh of course i think almost everything on
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:19.740]   netflix now i think it might be yeah all the new stuff is being shot in ht
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.260]   and you also tell me what it's like on your new fork i don't
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:27.980]   you don't have a 4k hcr tv i have a 4k i have a couple 4k
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:31.420]   hcs but i don't have the htr yet uh i have it in the office because we were
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:35.820]   testing streaming to the to the tv but but i don't have it in at home
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.420]   so i'm definitely i'm definitely gonna stream it after i've had dinner and
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:42.300]   when it's like 10 hours before breakfast because
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.460]   if i watch this at 4 p.m that's gonna be a 10 000 calorie dinner for you
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.100]   you should watch it while you're eating dinner i watched the first episode and
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.180]   your your food that you're eating is like oh i'm just having this boring you
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.620]   know salad or something but you're watching the episode and you're going
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:03.660]   oh yeah that's so funny looking that's you're thinking that that's that's
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:07.740]   dangerous i was i was just like it was a busy work day i was having my usual like
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:12.460]   busy work day dinner and cut the dvr and i'm watching uh episodes of an
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.740]   episode of chop when it's one of the kids tournaments and i'm seeing these kids
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:20.780]   put together these um like nine 10 11 year olds amazing dishes and only like
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.980]   a half an hour merely looking and i'm looking at my microwave burrito and
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:28.780]   thinking that i'm not very impressed with myself at this moment i well at least
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.260]   you sovieded it i did sovied
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:36.620]   i uh yeah i have to be very careful about shows like that
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:39.740]   they make it very hard to fast let's do it that way
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.140]   um i had fantasies of going to hero's restaurant
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:47.980]   when i'm with when we were in tokyo and then uh somebody told me
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:53.580]   well it's obama and abbe ate there about two years ago and he has now booked
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:58.380]   through his retirement you you literally there you cannot get in
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:01.740]   there right and you never will because he's gonna retire in a few years and
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:06.860]   they're booked for next five yeah it's like okay well so much for that
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:09.500]   uh i got a box today and i always love it when
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.780]   presents come and laura you you noted and you said what is it but i said i'm going

[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:21.020]   dale baskin of dp review reviewing the new 360 degree cameras
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.460]   he took a look at the rylo and the fusion he liked the rylo for its price
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:28.220]   uh four hundred bucks but he pointed out there for 200 bucks more you could get
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:33.100]   the new go pro fusion and i man i went back and forth but i feel like the
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:37.100]   higher resolution of the fusion i'm looking for the best possible picture
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.380]   after looking reviews on the go pro fusion i thought maybe i made a mistake
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.540]   because the software apparently is terrible
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:47.340]   but i ended up getting the fusion and i am pleased to say alex lindsey tells me
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.340]   i haven't i have i made the right choice
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.420]   this camera uh is a 360 degree camera so it's a go pro
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:59.980]   with lenses front and back each of which get 180 degrees
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:04.300]   in fact in order to make that work you have to put two sd cards in one for each
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:10.060]   camera which is kuku and then uh it's a little bigger than a go pro although
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.180]   i'm glad to say it comes with a selfie stick so that
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.340]   you can um uh hold because with the 360 it's actually really nice it's a selfie
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.700]   stick that's a tripod yeah you want to kind of put it up in the air
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.700]   um i i'm not really recommending it because i haven't reviewed it yet but i
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:29.420]   i'm what do you think so i have most of the 360
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.980]   i figured you did yeah from uh from uh from a uh the little ones that are that you
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:37.740]   put on your iphone all the way up to an ozo yeah um it's the 60 000
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:41.340]   dollar no kia yeah don't make them anymore but anyway so uh
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:45.100]   uh too much 60 000 is too much anyway so um turned out nobody wanted it
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.620]   well it's everybody Alex everybody wanted it nobody could afford it maybe
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.260]   that's a better way of six of them they're all paid off six of them
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:55.260]   yeah it's not all paid off so anyway that's why we like to go to Alex's
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:45:00.140]   garage sales kits holy crap um anyway so the uh
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:07.340]   uh the i think for a um non-stereo high quality this is the
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:10.460]   the best one that's out there right now what do you mean not stereo well it
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:12.860]   doesn't shoot stereo it doesn't shoot stereo 360
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:18.860]   so stereo stereo 3 oh 3d 3d 360 i don't like 3d so if you don't like that it
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.300]   doesn't matter um the what i like about it is that the
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.940]   res don't don't do that oh yeah that's a lens
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.540]   yeah that's a lens you can't put it down that's the only bad thing the one thing
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:32.300]   we there is no side on which you could just set it in the case it has a case
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:35.100]   so anyway so i it's the one thing with the train everybody with the thedas
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:39.100]   like don't put it down theta down theta down so my my run around camera that i
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.620]   use all the time is my theta i take pictures i take i don't usually shoot
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.180]   video with the theta because it's bad um but i shoot lots and lots of stills and
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:51.020]   i do all kinds of hdr's and i do you know a lot of other things with the theta
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:55.100]   and i think it's the best all around camera for the quality though i you
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.140]   know for a camera that's under a thousand dollars it's not going to be stereo
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:01.260]   700 this is great because it the resolution tire
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.740]   on the video yeah um and it stabilization is really great so you can be walking
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.220]   intriguing to me so you can take you can take your this
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.380]   the selfie stick out yeah and you can be walking along a path
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:17.020]   and when you stitch it will read it's it's got a accelerometer inside so it's
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:21.500]   the software is grabbing all that data and it actually will straighten out that
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.460]   it's not just tracking um the the information and it creates this nice
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:31.500]   smooth uh you know so very go proe um in the sense that it it can it can do
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:34.860]   that uh it can kind of smooth that out i need a gimbal in other words this is
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:38.380]   a gimbal it's got it's got a virtual gimbal it's not perfect but it's it's
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.140]   great um it's software stabilization yeah software stabilization but it's got
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:47.980]   information coming from the camera as well so it is a great um a great little
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:51.260]   camera to uh like the tripod built into the selfie stick
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:56.380]   that's cool yeah and uh yeah and uh so we should do shows with this maybe huh
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:01.500]   um is he uh how is the audio on it uh i i almost never use audio from any of
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.980]   these cameras so i don't i mean i always record it separately i use
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:07.980]   them as scratch i use the i use the i need to just use it to sync but if i'm
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:11.580]   gonna do audio i do it with real tools well i'm thinking maybe bring it to the
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:14.700]   pink concert i nobody get mad at me if i see watch the
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.540]   concert with my hand in the ear the whole time
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:22.060]   it's geez right i like the idea of uh having this show just in VR so you know
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.700]   you can watch it yeah what you're gonna say yeah
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:28.140]   yeah so and yeah you could see all the the people behind the scenes doing the
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.900]   camera work and it's just there all you have to do is just turn around and
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:35.100]   you see everything that's one of the things i'm kind of thinking about
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.300]   uh so much of content is done kind of like theater with a proscenium like
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:44.220]   there's a place you look so really when you're gonna use stuff like this i would
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.620]   think you would want to do it the same thing with the concert
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:49.820]   you'd want to do is somewhere where there's stuff going on all around you
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.060]   does that seem the case that's the way we design 360 is always like i want to
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:57.580]   be able to tell three or four stories with whatever i'm capturing and even
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.060]   when we're casting things we've had stuff where we have different but we
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:03.260]   literally design three four five stories that are going on
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:06.300]   oh that's so that you have and they're all interrelated to each other
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.500]   they're all you're in a space but we've thought of it we don't want you
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:14.140]   a lot of the old-fashioned LA oh sorry but old-fashioned Hollywood folks
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:17.580]   you old-fashioned people they're all talking about why we use sound to guide
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.300]   you to look where we want you to look and then we're gonna have you look over
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:23.740]   here and we're like no we're just gonna make you know all of it interesting
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.340]   yeah but and so maybe it's only five minutes long but you might want to
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:30.060]   watch it for two hours because there's yeah all these other things that you
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:33.180]   want to gather yeah so that said one of the best VR
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:36.460]   experiences i've ever had was one of the first times that when i broke up when i
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:41.500]   got the first gear VR from Samsung and it was that lip sync
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:44.540]   challenge show that's on like high number cable whatever
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.780]   but all they did was they put a 360 degree camera like on a tripod in the
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.620]   audience and because i was standing in my office
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:56.060]   and i'm just standing and the VR point of view is of someone standing in an
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:59.100]   audience it was like being at a live event because i could turn around i could
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.380]   look at the back of the other room i wanted to it really did feel like
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:05.820]   it was such an immersive experience just standing in a crowd and doing what i
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.340]   do in a crowd that when the song was over i muscle memory just got me
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:11.660]   applauding and so i realized i know with you
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:15.740]   wow that's pretty that's actually pretty high
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:19.420]   recommendation if it's that vivid so lori we're gonna be making stuff for you
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.180]   in your oculus go yes i can't wait more content
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.620]   you've got to get ready for the render time what star wars yes somebody said it
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:30.860]   takes like all day it's yeah you i have an iMac pro will that help
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:33.980]   oh it'll help but it's still gonna take a long time so you know you'll you'll
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:37.660]   like if you shoot like this show you'll oh i would never do that render it all
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:40.220]   week i remember when you did it at the ozo you shot it
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:44.140]   15 minutes on the ozo took a week well i had some new yet some technical
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:47.580]   issues i've done some couple things wrong it wasn't it wasn't exactly this is
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:51.500]   not gonna make it in podcasting so if you want something less expensive the

[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.100]   review on dp review the rylo's really cool yeah
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:01.420]   and it's tiny and stuff uh the fusion's just a little bigger and about 200 bucks
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:05.020]   more expensive i didn't get a rylo though you know i got the fusion because
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:09.660]   why not right uh ladies and gentlemen that concludes this
