[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all things
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Macintosh my last episode.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Before three out of the four panelists go to China.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Alex Lindsay, we're leaving you behind.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   AlexLindsayapixelcourt.tv.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You can't go.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I might think about something I'm going to say.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   You've got to take over the show.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You've got to run this place.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We need you here.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'll hold down the fort.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hold down the fort.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, I'll be here Tuesday.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Oh, you will.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   That's right.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Alex is going to have somebody to be with him because Andy Ennaco
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   doesn't leave for China until the following week.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yes.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   You're going later.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Also with us, Scott Born, who is also here, but he has the
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   shirt that looks like he's traveling.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So wait a minute.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Three of the four panelists are going to China.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   This either means that I'm no longer a panelist or that I'm
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   going to China.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Did I count wrong?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yes.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Three out of five.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Okay.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Well, normally Mr. Don McAllister is not with us.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Screencast's online.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He's a semi-regular visitor to Mac Break Weekly, but he is
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   going to China.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yes.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I've dragged myself away from my preparations.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm still hurriedly preparing slides and all sorts of things.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So it's, yeah, but I need to break.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Oh, I need to break badly.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And I'm not going to get one because I have to do everything.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I have to not only do my radio show ahead of time and do all the
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Twitch shows ahead of time, most of which we prerecorded.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm also going to be doing those four lectures one of these days
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   that I have to deliver on Mac Mania 9.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   There's always that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   One of these days I committed to four lectures, 60 iPhone apps
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and 60 seconds.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That should be easy.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I've got at least 60 on my phone alone.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Just hold on to my phone and say, "Here, please."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Look, can you see that?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Can you see that?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   60 freeware downloads in 60 seconds.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I'm just going to take all of your picks for the last two years.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Then an easy one for me, which is an introduction to social media
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   because I live it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And then finally I have to do a lecture on home theater PC
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   using a Mac mini.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's the one that's going to kill me before I get off the ship.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Because you can't do any of this in China, of course.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You've got to do it now.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm leaving in two days.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So, Don, we're excited, aren't we?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Don did a really nice, really nice I-Web page.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Well, I was sort of, it just happened to be a chance actually.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I need to think of a show to do when I come back.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'm actually taking two weeks off.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Normally I do prepare shows in advance, but this time I thought,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   no, it was just too much work.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Unlike some who only have four sessions, I've actually got six sessions
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   to put together.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You have six?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Oh, they...
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So, you know what you should have made in retrospect one session B is
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   doing an I-Web page for your trip to China.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's right.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's right.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   No, but I'll save that for when I come back.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So, I hurriedly put together one and I'm actually going to use that
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   to talkload photos, upload videos.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   There's a blog on there as well which I'm going to try and use with my iPhone.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I've integrated a Tumblr blog so well.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   We're going to have a go with that as well.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But, yeah, see how it goes really.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And then when I come back, I'll be able to do a tutorial on how I put the website
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   together, how the different tools worked, and what I found the most useful and
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   most successful.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   You inspire me to open up I-Web because I hadn't opened it up since '06,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   probably, and play with a little bit.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   They have some nice little widgets now like this time to departure.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   That's right.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's right.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   There's a nice RSS widget so you can have just a blank page and bring in an RSS feed.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And that's what I've done for Tumblr.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You can have audio or you can have text or you can have photos.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And basically just embedded a Tumblr RSS feed in there.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So I should be able to update that from my iPhone and it should appear within
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   the I-Web page.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So, well-
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   This is actually fun.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   This is for, I think, for you and me and Annie, I don't know about you,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Annie, but I presume it's going to be an experiment in how much live blogging
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   real-time coverage you can do of something like this.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Well, as long as we don't get too wrapped up in the technology and forget about the content,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I mean, you're more of a content guy so you'll probably be providing the content.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And I'll just be playing with the tools.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Well, I see how it goes.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I mean, this is fun for me.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Are you going to do anything, Andy, from the...
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I guess you're on a boat.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So you're not going to have as much of an opportunity to.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, probably not.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I have a day in a hotel before and then a couple days after.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So hopefully I will have some stuff.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But hopefully when I get back to Shanghai, I can do a couple days' worth of stuff,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   and start posting.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I'm mostly looking into making sure that I know how to use Mars edit for archiving,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   setting up a whole bunch of things on a bunch of blogs I'm doing to set up so they can
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   basically deploy while I'm away and create the illusion that I'm actually still in the
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   United States of America.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Again, I've never...
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And cruises that we've done before, we've had Internet access that was expensive, but it's sort of work,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   so you could sort of budget what you're going to do.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   This is the first time that I'm simply going to assume that I'm not going to have access.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Actually, it does put one big item on my to-do list time.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I've been sort of putting off switching my email host provider because they give me sort of
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   extremely good service, but very limited amount of storage space.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And so that means that I have to make sure that happens well before I leave so that the
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   changeover is in place.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So if I don't answer my email for a whole week in worst case scenarios, there'll be
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   plenty of storage that all that stuff will just simply fill up in the inbox.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Are we just weird?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Or is this kind of weird?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Something people are going to be doing in future when they travel is like kind of do this live
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   real-time travel diary.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   No, I think that the whole infrastructure is going to appear because...
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I mean, we're weird in that, you know, we're in our 30s and our 40s and we're doing this sort of stuff.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   We didn't grow up with this idea of always being connected and always being into social media sites.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   But now we have a whole generation of people that they never knew the idea of answering a ringing telephone.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   They always knew the idea of just ex-messaging people.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So when those people start getting real jobs and start making real money, they're going to be...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   They're going to want to spend $30 a month for, look, here is a single IP address, a single address that will simply be a pipeline that works
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   everywhere and anywhere to get all of your status reports and all of your photos and all your videos into one location.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Well, and I think that we saw in the news that just after the, you know, since the iPhone has been released,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   the video to YouTube, the cell-based or phone-based video to YouTube has jumped.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I think it's four times.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I've done two or three videos already and they're just stupid and consequential videos just to play with it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Right.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And it's making a huge impact on when it's actually easy to do and then people will start to do it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I knew this. We predicted this would happen.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I mean, it's exploding.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And I think that, you know, I am almost done.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   My blog is all designed and it's all sitting there.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's done.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's finally done.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I've been with you through a few of these.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I mean, you were...
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's all done.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   What about the Vox?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   No, I'm square-spaced.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   No, I'm square-spaced it.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Okay.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And so now I'm going to start.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But one of the things I've been doing research on is Mars edit and also I'm bloggers.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Love Mars edit.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And Blogo.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I blogo.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Blogo is for the phone?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   For the phone.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So I can link directly into Squarespace from my iPhone and be able to post images.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And I haven't tried video yet, but images and text to it.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   So that's all, you know, that makes it a lot easier to do that kind of stuff.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So the thing is now though, is that the tools are getting so much easier that, you know,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   your average person will actually be wanting to use this stuff very, very soon.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The problem is, as Andy said, is the infrastructure.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I mean, it was difficult enough for me when I come across the states because if I try
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   to use my iPhone, I haven't got a data plan in this state.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   We need to solve this.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   This is crazy.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You know, it's just crackers.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And for the trip we're going away on, it's similar to you.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I'm having to buy a special package.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   But I'm having to buy like 50 megabytes of data for 50 pounds.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   That's a pound of megabytes.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Not only at six pounds of megabytes, six pounds for a single megabyte of data from your iPhone.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's just crazy.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   We were talking with Chris Markhart, our photo guy before the show, and he pointed out that
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.640]   the raw image from my Canon 5D Mark II is 25 megabytes.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.080]   So I would in two pictures.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.000]   I would use up all of that fans were done.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   That's crazy.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Absolutely crazy.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And with boom.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And so this is actually why I think that eventually things like the iPhone will be free.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Because they're making so much money on it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Just like, you know, most people are not old enough to know what a typewriter is that listen
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   to this show.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   But back in the day, there were these things called typewriters that weren't connected to
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   a monitor and you typed and it just came out on a paper.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And IBM used to give the IBM Selectric, which was the most popular typewriter, to the secretarial
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   schools by the thousands.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They give them away.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240]   They would give them to the schools by the thousands.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.000]   So when the people who graduated from the secretarial school, they would work at the
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   big insurance companies.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.760]   They'd say, I only know how to use the IBM Selectric so the big insurance companies would buy
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   them.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.480]   And then they'd buy all those ribbons.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.760]   And that's literally what grew IBM's typewriter business to be.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   That makes sense.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   Huge.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.320]   So why not Apple give away the iPhone and then get poor guys like all you folks going to
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.520]   China to pay millions of dollars for bandwidth?
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   Someone was asking me about the difference.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   I would stand at the Apple store.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   And someone was asking me about whether I was going to get the 32 or the 16.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.080]   And I was like, with my international plan, because I've been in and out, I'm canceling
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.040]   it now because I'm not traveling as much.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.280]   But with my international plan, I was paying for an iPhone a month.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   Right.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   So the thing is, is it was like, I don't want to fix more.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   That's not going to worry about that.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.320]   So without the, because the international plan on IT&T is like $199 a month.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.280]   You actually, Scott, have pinpointed a new business model really for a lot of people.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   It's not really new.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   I mean, it goes back to shit.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   Things do.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.840]   I mean, you know, it's surprising they don't jump on it.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.360]   You know, speaking of cell phones, you know, FCC is getting a little harsh on AT&T.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.960]   I'm not sure I even agree with this saying this Apple exclusive might be illegal.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   I think that's BS.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.040]   I mean, I'm not happy about it.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.120]   I think I think it might be BS, but I'm all for Verizon having a, I would love Verizon
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   to have it.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.520]   And by the way, here's the thing, these, these models have been in place forever.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.560]   And the iPhone, iPhone didn't pioneer, you know, the exclusive relation.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   Okay.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.800]   But that doesn't make it okay.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.120]   But my question is, should the government be able to say to, to, to, to businesses, no,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.560]   you can't do an exclusive deal?
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.160]   Well, but my question is why not say that 13 years ago when the first of these kinds
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.560]   of arrangements were made long before there was an iPhone?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   Well, okay.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.840]   But they could say it now because maybe they got aware of it.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.360]   Maybe it's become out of, out of control.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   I think it's just now.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   But I'm wondering if they should even say it.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.960]   That doesn't even make sense to say it, frankly.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   I mean, no, it doesn't.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.560]   You know, because there is no antitrust there.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.800]   You have other choice for that.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.560]   It's two independent companies.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.000]   Anti-trust has to do with you not having another choice.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Right.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.600]   So, I mean, I want, I want Verizon to do it, but I just don't think the, the, maybe the
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   federal government should be intervening.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.960]   I think it's just that, that Apple is, is turning, is taking the same juggernaut that
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.000]   they had with music and they're applying it to phones.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.720]   And I'm not happy about it.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   What?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   Maybe that's the justification that the FCC gets involved is, it's not good for consumer
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.940]   choice.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.040]   But why should Apple have to do a CDMA phone?
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.880]   I mean, it was a really good analysis.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.400]   I think I put a link in our, in our show notes for a, a, a, why I think it was a groupers,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.960]   why it seems unlikely that Apple will ever go on for Verizon.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.120]   Now you believe, Scott, in fact, you said it would happen by now that Apple would go
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   on for Verizon.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.280]   Well, I wish people would listen to what I said.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.880]   I never said it would happen by now.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.440]   What I said was that I had a source who I believed, who had been right in the past, who
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:54.040]   said that Verizon would be announcing in June some sort of iPhone announcement.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.280]   Well, that didn't happen at least unless it happens by the end of the day.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.520]   But I never said it was going to happen.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.680]   I said, that's what he told me.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.920]   And he really believed it when he told me I could tell he believed it.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.640]   So perhaps he got wrong information.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.720]   I, I still think that given the passion, given the passion he talked to me with, and
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.000]   he's been a good source in the past, I also got it from a second source.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.680]   So there's some people in Verizon, at least, that clearly believe they're getting some
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   sort of iPhone.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.640]   Now, whether it's an iPhone mini or whether it's, you know, obviously they're going to
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.600]   have to redo the phone to work on that network, but they seem to think it's true.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.480]   And if it's true, it's, it'd be great.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   I think it would be great.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.200]   Now, let me say what, let me say what Glenn Fleischman says.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.320]   And actually it was in tidbits.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:41.680]   He says that you're not going to see an iPhone on Verizon for just because Verizon CDMA.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.360]   And it's, it's even for it.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.640]   He says that there's no future for CDMA.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.720]   It's only used in the US, only used in North America, I should say.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.240]   That's actually not true.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   Where else is it?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.840]   They're actually rolling it out in different parts of the world.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   Rolling it out.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   That's crazy.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   GSM is the future, right?
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.640]   Well, the, the, the big thing is, is if you're in areas where you don't want as many satellites,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.720]   as many cell cell sites, see the reason that Verizon has better coverage than everyone else
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.560]   is because they don't need your many sites.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.120]   They don't, they can have the same number of sites in twice as much coverage.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.920]   Now he's saying that the Apple would have to change their chip provider because they
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.080]   use Infineon and Infineon doesn't make a CDMA.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.520]   They'd have to go to Qualcomm or somebody else.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.240]   So do you, do you, what do you think about that Scott?
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   Do you think that that's?
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.280]   Well, I think that that buoys up the argument I've heard that it's not going to, here's
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.280]   the problem.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.920]   The new iPhone that would make it to Verizon would not be the iPhone we have in our pockets,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.200]   would just make everybody mad because they wouldn't get all the same stuff.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.880]   It would probably be some sort of iPhone, many or iPhone light.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.000]   It would have all the features.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.800]   I think there's a good, I think there's a good business case to do it, but you'd have
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.220]   to do it along the lines of something smaller or easier to deal with and that probably wouldn't
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.880]   be the big hit for everybody that the current iPhone is.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.040]   I don't know, you know, I think that it is an interesting problem.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   I don't see the advantages other than reaching the Verizon network of switching to CDMA, but
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.840]   I know there's a whole lot of people, me included, that get better at, I'd like it.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.000]   I have better reception on my Verizon phone than any of the other phones.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.520]   I have three different cell companies because I travel a lot, so I have to have different
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.600]   cell carriers in different places.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.360]   But the Verizon works most places, the AT&T works the second most.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.760]   I get much better coverage from Verizon.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.680]   Well, I think that this is a typical VHS versus Betamax issue because CDMA-
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.280]   It was better but lost.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.960]   CDMA will probably end up losing, but it is a superior technology.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.520]   Well, is it really Betamax versus VHS?
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.200]   Because that wasn't a battle over the hardware that the people buy.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.800]   It's about the software that they get after they buy it.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.240]   I mean, if I have a Verizon MyFi in my pocket, I don't really care what network it uses to
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.320]   get me broadband as long as it works great and I get good coverage.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.760]   I mean, I tend to believe that Apple has a plan for CDMA if they want to go that way.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   I don't know.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.800]   I believe it or not, AT&T would have to screw things up even worse than they are right now
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.680]   for Apple to make that kind of a move.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.480]   But I don't think it's ridiculous that they would ever make that move if they felt it was
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   an Apple's best entry.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.240]   It's just that the coverage is, I think, is Apple's a killy seal because the...
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.360]   I talked to a guy who has an iPhone.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.920]   I mean, he's a guy who bought the iPhone.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.280]   He was excited about having the iPhone and he's literally going back to his BlackBerry
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.200]   because he said he just got tired of his calls getting dropped.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.920]   He's just tired of all my calls getting dropped constantly and my BlackBerry never does that.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   You know?
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.040]   On Verizon and that's the reason he's going back is coverage.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.720]   Coverage is the iPhone's a killy seal, in my opinion.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   I think everything else, it is far superior in every...
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.920]   Coverage and 3G speed.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   And 3G speed.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   Although it's fun.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.800]   Although it's like, it's out that EVDO does not allow you to have a call going on at
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.880]   the same time as EVDO like HSDP-A.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.440]   Well, but also, I mean, as I've tested the actual 3G speed with, if you take speed tests,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.880]   I mean, I can do it right now.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.040]   If you take speed tests and you test it on your iPhone, the speeds are actually fairly
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   fast.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.600]   I mean, 1.5 megabits a second typically in Petaluma anyway.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.400]   And you know, a lot of what we thought of as it being slow turned out to be a lot of
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.840]   the Java, you know, the stuff that has been accelerated.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.640]   I mean, I have noticed a market.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.400]   Yeah, a faster phone made a big difference.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   More than I would have ever expected.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.240]   All right, well, so, of course, this is what you can recuse yourself on this time, McAllister,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.640]   since you don't, you don't have any CDMA carriers.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.240]   Orange is the carrier right now.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.440]   Well, no, it's O2 is the carrier for the iPhone.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   O2, I'm sorry.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440]   Okay.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   In the UK.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   Are they good?
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.480]   As much of a, I mean, we've been really hit with high charges when the 3G S came out.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.640]   So there's been an awful lot of complaints about the actual charges, the upgrade chart.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.800]   We've been through all that before.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.480]   But I mean, as a sell provider, the no better and no worse than anybody else, to be honest,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.520]   we don't really, at least I haven't got a perception of who is a good carrier and who
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   isn't.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.360]   No, they're all repatient money grabbers.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   Yes.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360]   Repacious.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   I love it.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   Repacious money grabbers.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.920]   Well, let's face it.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   I mean, you know, 50 pounds for 50 megabytes and in my case, 50 bucks for 50 megabytes.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   That's outrageous.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.440]   You know, what at that rate at that rate, I'm worth about 300 megabytes.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.280]   That kind of pounds, Scott.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   Oh, I'm in trouble because I have to be very, very good and very, very ethical and not mean
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.240]   because right now I have at least two like smartphones like in my loaner locker.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.520]   That's I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.280]   You could use those loaners.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.600]   I bet that Blackberry would really like me to see how well the Blackberry works in Japan
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   and China and Korea.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.000]   I bet they'd be willing to underwrite the $90,000 we cost international film charges.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   It's so tempting.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Isn't it?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I'll write about the experience.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   No, no, no.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's very tempting.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I mean, the big problem we have over here is coverage.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.200]   I mean, the main metropolitan area is fine, but you know, you go outside of that and the
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.080]   coverage really, I mean, I'm really yet miffed with my phone because if I sit at the front
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.920]   of the house, you know, in the office where I am now in the studio where I can't use my
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.120]   phone, my iPhone as a phone because I get no cell signal.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.280]   I have to literally go outside into the rear garden and then I will pick up.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.720]   It's not 3G, but at least I'll get a cell signal there.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.400]   And I'm just waiting for them to bring out the bath.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   I've seen them.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.160]   I've only seen them in the States, but you know, a box you can connect to your broadband
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.960]   network that gives you a mini cell tower in your house.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   Yes.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   Why don't they bring that?
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   I would love that.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.360]   I would pay for that tomorrow if they would just bring that out.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.320]   Honey, the fuzzball, not his real name, in our chat room, in our friend feed chat.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   That is real name?
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320]   No.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   I guessed.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.960]   Gunny, the fuzzball says an iPhone on Sprint would save Sprint.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   I wonder if Apple get this would consider buying Sprint then owning the hardware and
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   the network.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   Aren't they ahead of the curve on the 4G?
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.840]   Sprint's got YMAX.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.920]   You know, they're dying.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.280]   They've lost 4 million customers.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.040]   The pre is going to maybe help them a little bit, but not as much as the iPhone helps AT&T.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.400]   Well, the key for Apple is to let Sprint get all the way to the point where they have
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.560]   to start selling pennies on the dollar.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.040]   Cell towers and then buy the network and then buy the whole network.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   That would be you.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   Sprint's advantage.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   That's why I would do.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   Sprint's advantage.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.000]   And we know Scott Borne, the corporate raider, knows the way to do it.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.400]   Sprint's advantage originally was that they were Southern Pacific and they had railway right
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   of right ways.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.160]   And so they were able to put cell towers all over the place.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.640]   They probably have a fairly good network.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.320]   I think, yeah, I think they used to have one of the better networks.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   Why are people leaving Sprint then?
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.120]   Because they've gotten, they've got, they don't, they're not the best at anything.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.760]   You know, I think it's because it's because their customer service motto is that famous
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.240]   motto we've talked about before.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.480]   We're not happy until you're not happy.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   I actually left Sprint.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   I thought that was everybody's.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   I thought that was everybody's.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.000]   But I have to point out, yeah, none of them are perfect.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Some are better.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.480]   For example, I was with them eons ago back when we had the Maxwell Smart Size shoe phones.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.680]   And you know, they tripled build me for a year and a half.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Yep.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.360]   And when we caught them on it, they said, ah, so what?
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.080]   I had exactly that problem.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   So I said, so what this?
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.240]   I'm suing you and I'm leaving you.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.720]   I think I think it's hard for, I think it's hard to make a case for either team of a lower
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   Sprint.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.920]   I mean, I think that you get into the situation and they can run these ads that you're going
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   to save money or whatever.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.480]   The bottom line is is the people who want great coverage use Verizon and people who want
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.040]   a great phone use AT&T.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   Right.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.720]   And there's, you know, it's very hard to get in between.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   Big opportunity for AT&T and maybe this is, maybe they'll step up to improve their network.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   To improve their 3G.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.960]   If they could take a leap forward in 4G to improve their customer service to lower their
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.880]   costs, make it, make it somewhere that people are happy to be and have the best phone.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   And I think, I think it's hard.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.200]   I think it's very hard to compete with Verizon.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.920]   Verizon has taken this leadership role in coverage because they know that it would be
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.240]   extremely expensive to try to compete head to head with the CDMA coverage.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   That's the issue is that that's that's that's their one, you know, that's their advantage
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   and they take advantage.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   You know, it's very, very painful to for actually it's not their only advantage advantage because
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.640]   CDMA at least, and this is very technical.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.440]   I'm not an expert on this, but it was my understanding was better for data, at least initially.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.640]   GSM now has kind of a CDMA like wrapper built into it, but CDMA was designed about around
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   data.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   Great.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   And so that's the other advantage.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   They have a higher speed network.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.480]   It's more robust, more reliable and fewer cell towers.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   Right.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   But they don't have the iPhone.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480]   Right.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   Actually, no one has the iPhone.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.800]   Let me take a break and we're going to talk about shortages and just, is that what you're
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   going to bring up?
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   Scott.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.960]   No, actually I was going to ask you if any of you are having trouble to with the phone's
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.440]   heating is three or four people.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   Let's talk about that.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   The brown cases as well.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.240]   It's three or four people sent me emails saying their phone was getting hot, but we have
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.080]   six of them here and not one of them has experienced that.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.160]   There's a theory on that, but we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.800]   First I want to do mention our fine sponsors.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   It's Citrix.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.360]   The folks who do go to meeting.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   It is a Mac product as well now.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   I'm really pleased they've done a Mac version of go to meeting.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.560]   Go to meeting is my favorite online meeting software.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.480]   And I've used it for an awful long time.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.920]   So I can, I could say this with absolute assurance.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   We use it even.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.400]   It's so good and so fast and reliable.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.680]   We even use it on the shows.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.160]   We use it on Maxwell's house.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.560]   So Maxwell can show his screens.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.800]   We use it for meetings all the time.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.920]   Wherever we hold a meeting, we use go to meeting because it's just easy to install.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.040]   In fact, you could try it right now.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak and give it a shot.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   You'll have it installed within a couple of minutes.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.280]   It saves you time, but really saves you money too.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.760]   And nowadays, business needs to save every penny it can.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.000]   I mean, you can't afford to waste time these days flying to meetings or going to meetings.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   You can't afford to meet in person as much.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.920]   Go to meeting lets you hold your meetings online.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.880]   They include free voice over the internet and free teleconferencing in their $49 a month
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.080]   rate.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.800]   For as many, by the way, 49 bucks a month for as many meetings as you want as long as
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.840]   you want.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.080]   You compare that with anybody else.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.400]   I think you'll see why this is such a good deal.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.080]   Great for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaborating on documents.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.720]   And as I said, we've even invented new uses for it on the air.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   Just fantastic.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.240]   Any kind of conference call, make it more visual, make it more useful, make it more effective
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   with GoToMeeting.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   Try it free right now.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.280]   For 30 days, go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.800]   This is a time for you to show it to your clients, your colleagues too, show it to the boss.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   So I've got a better way to do this.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.400]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   We know you're going to like it.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.720]   Thank them so much for their support of our fine program.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.160]   We should use GoToMeeting to run an entire episode of Macbreak just to see what that
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   would be.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   We actually could.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.600]   The way we use it with Maxwell's house is he'll invite me to a meeting and they'll
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.840]   have one of my screens.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.560]   We have a free screen on the Skype of Saurus.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   We could do it.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.200]   He'll have it on one of my screens.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   And then he has slides.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   He'll show slides.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.520]   If you guys had stuff you wanted to show, we could do that.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.680]   We could have one session going.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.200]   You're all a member of it and you can give control to each of you.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.800]   It actually proves to be a really good way to get screenshots.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   But I just do this.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.600]   I do it for you so you guys don't have to.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.800]   By the way, lovely shirt today, Scott.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   I like that.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   Thank you so much.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.040]   This is from the latest Tommy Bahama collection.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   It's really pretty.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.440]   Do you know that there is a Tommy Bahama outlet store in Vacaville, California?
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.000]   I do, really.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.800]   Let's make a field trip really.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   It is significant.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.520]   I did not know.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.960]   It's much cheaper to buy the shirts there.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.880]   There's nothing wrong with them.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.200]   They try to keep turning over.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   They're last years.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.840]   Yeah, they're last years.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.040]   So normally $180 shirt, I picked up some for 90.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   Field trip.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   Field trip.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   Really?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:09.000]   I own all the black Tommy Bahama shirts produced in the last year and a half.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I just walk in.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.360]   There's a Tommy Bahama shirt, like a block from our office, a store.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.240]   So I just walk in about once every two or three weeks and I just pick out the next black
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   one and go, okay.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.600]   Now you can replenish your wardrobe with the smaller sizes for less.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   I know.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.800]   Yeah, the original ones are...
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.400]   They're a little baggy.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.000]   They're a little baggy.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.580]   This sounds a little metrosexual, but Alex took me on a shopping trip to get black Tommy
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.580]   Bahama shirts.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.580]   You didn't get black.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.580]   You got red.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   I got some beautiful ones.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.580]   I got one.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.580]   I'm a big fan of the Tommy Bahama.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.280]   I'm a big fan of the Tommy Bahama lifestyle.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.720]   Leo and I had so much fun.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   Oh my goodness.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.560]   I'm a fan of San Francisco.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   We went to the San Francisco.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.480]   I just realized that each one of us could have our own clothing.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Clothing is the sponsor.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   Our own clothing.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480]   We could.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   I've got five on one tactical.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.120]   Scott Scott Tommy Bahama.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.560]   Well, I'm Scott Eves.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.040]   In fact, I will be wearing...
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   I will be clad and my son in all Scott Eves.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.880]   Everything...
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.440]   And every podcast that they brought to you by.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   I'm Scott Eves.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   I'm tempted.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.160]   He just sent them to me, which is very nice of him.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.320]   They could be the botany 500 of Macbreak Weely.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.200]   Actually, this would be a spin-off show.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.520]   The Mac eye for the windows guy.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   So pathetic.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   How did this...
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.440]   We're not supposed to think about clothes.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.920]   What is wrong with you guys?
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.480]   You could make clothing geeky.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.720]   I have five old and practical socks in my drawer.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.640]   See, this is a gap in the Scott Eves line.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.680]   They don't do underwear.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   And so I will be...
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   Will be pockets.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.120]   I will be clad head to toe, except for my pocket at underwear in Scott Eves.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   And then I'm going to wear...
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   I've got some...
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.440]   My wife bought me some nice keen hiking sandals.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   But my question for you gentlemen...
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.680]   Geeky for the traveling guy.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.880]   Socks or no socks with the keen sandals?
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   Socks.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   So really, you say it's okay.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.560]   Well, you're old enough to get away with just about anything under sandals.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   But you're American.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   You're over 35.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.920]   I'm going to look like a German tourist.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.360]   My wife calls them grandpa shoes when I wear my sandals over my...
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.640]   I told numerous times by my staff that if I wear sandals, I'm simply not allowed to
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   wear socks.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   Well, it's just to see.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   I used to be very, very much anti-socks with sandals.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.360]   But on the flight to WWDC a couple of weeks ago, everybody was wearing flip flops.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.080]   I'm talking like 300 incredibly chalky white bony, knobbly feet with toenail problems and
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   gets like...
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   I don't want to see that.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.320]   I can't talk into wearing shoes, which you should be wearing on a flight.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.560]   They're going through airport security, taking off their sandals.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   An inch and a half of foam, rubber and rub and plastic was not enough between my feet
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.640]   and that carpet.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.680]   What would you be wearing, Dan McAllister?
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.880]   It's going to be 100 degrees and 99 percent humidity in China.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.520]   Yeah, I have got some sandals, but I must admit, I tend not to wear socks.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   So, sorry, Andy.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.600]   I'll try to get a pedicule before I go.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.760]   Apparently, there is a geek kind of underwear that Dvorak and Adam Curry talk about on
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.120]   their No Agenda podcast.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   I don't...
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.360]   I have geek underwear.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   Spiderman?
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   It's fast drying.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   Oh, I need that.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   I have that too.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   I have that too.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   A fishio or whatever, ex-a fishio or whatever.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.280]   They sell them at REI and they dry in like three hours.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.160]   So, I can go to Africa and I'll be in Africa for six weeks on like three pairs.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.480]   Apparently Hema is the company.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   It's a Dutch company.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.040]   I don't use he.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   And they make...
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.000]   I don't know why it's geek underwear.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   But...
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.440]   Well, I know it's in my dry in three hours.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Oh, it's long underwear.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   So, I don't need long underwear.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.120]   This is the last thing I need is long underwear.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   No, these ones are like...
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   I don't know how we got into that.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.800]   I want to get this quick drying underwear because I think I'll be washing some of my...
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.000]   No, it's t-shirts and things out in the sink.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.280]   And you get the little wool lights?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   You got the little wool.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   I'm so sorry.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   Everybody, I apologize.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.360]   We're getting back to the technology right now.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.960]   This is so pathetic.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   Technology, help.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.880]   We need to start talking about cars, disc brakes, things like that.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   Just a sort of...
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.080]   I just got an email from Guy goes, "I cannot believe you folks are the leaders in this
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.320]   podcasting stuff."
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:28.240]   Oh, Tilly makes great traveling underwear, apparently.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   Okay.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   Shortage.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   Shortage on...
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   There's a shortage quickly on iPhones.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.520]   Oregon has run out of iPhones.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   All of Oregon.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.400]   All of Oregon, there are no iPhones in Oregon.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.760]   Apparently, California, we're having a suffering some issues as well.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.240]   Well, you know, have any of you, any of us, Don, I don't know, Don, do you have an iPhone
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   3GS?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   Yes, I do.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   Definitely.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.560]   Have any of us...
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.200]   Has anyone had a hot iPhone 3GS?
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.880]   No, it might warm.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   Warm to the touch.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.520]   But apparently there's a manufacturing issue with some iPhone 3GSes.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.600]   But you've also heard that the white ones are turning brown when they do get that hot,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.320]   but that's not unusual, right?
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.560]   With that white plastic.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.040]   Wasn't that the problem with the MacBook?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   That it was turning...
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   I don't know.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   I don't buy white.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   Me neither.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.520]   I just think people with the white ones, I'm like, "The only reason to get a white one
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   is white."
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.520]   Should I got black?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   Well, we do have white.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.840]   I did get white one from my new part-time assistant Claudia, and in five days it has not
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   turned brown.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.360]   I think this is an isolated incident.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.640]   But I do see that they do get...
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.120]   It gets kind of worn when you're working.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   I mean, this is a faster process.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.760]   I have noticed that I've had some odd call issues.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   You know, dropouts?
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.280]   Well, dropouts, or just it doesn't seem...
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.720]   It seems like the network is hanging up, and then yesterday I couldn't hang up.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.440]   I was talking to my wife, and when we finished the conversation I couldn't...
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.720]   Like I couldn't get off the call.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   There was no way to get off the call.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Like it literally just had to wait until...
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.840]   That sounds like a freeze.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   The other side timed out.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.360]   No, everything else worked on the phone.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   That's weird.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.240]   I didn't call until ATT's message thing let go.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   I think I've had that.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.280]   I wonder now, is that AT&T or is that the phone?
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.080]   It just seemed like it just wouldn't let me go.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   Wouldn't let me go.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.160]   Yeah, I've had to sort of get fairly warm, say two or three times really.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   But warm enough to make me notice that it was slightly warmer than the original 3G.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.040]   But again, I've been using it for a while, and I think one was outside and it was quite
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   sunny.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.440]   So I wouldn't say it gets unusably hot, but it's certainly warmer.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.960]   But as Leo said, it's probably because of the faster processor and some of the extra bits
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.920]   in there.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.080]   So I've seen pictures of the brown iPhones.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.680]   I think that that is probably a cause for concern.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.800]   This white polycarbonate does turn brown, I think, as it overheats.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.320]   Remember they had the problem with the white MacBooks on the wrist rest?
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   They were yelling over that.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   I knew remember that.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   Yeah, and they were called those.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.800]   In fact, I think they switched them out for everybody who had the problem.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.200]   Well, you know what else my assistant said?
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   She looked at my phone.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   She goes, Scott, that is not black.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   And I said, what?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   What color is it?
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   Dark navy blue.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.640]   Oh, I hate it when women do that.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.440]   And I said, you're kidding me.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.880]   She said, you know, she said anybody can tell you that that's dark navy blue.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   She's wrong.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   It's black.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.360]   You should tell Apple that they've got the color wrong.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.280]   And I said, you know, I don't think I'm going to bother Steve.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.560]   My wife does that all the time.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   She says that's navy.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   Isn't that navy?
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   That is black.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   This is black.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   That's black.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   That's black.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   That's ebony.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   She claims this.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.920]   I've had this conversation with my wife.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   I'm not going to go on.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   It's not navy.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   It's not navy.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.120]   She claims that men can't see it.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.180]   Well, this man can't see it.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.520]   No man in this room can see it.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.600]   It's black.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   Black.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   Black.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.000]   So looking at the iPhone availability chart, this is at apple.com/retail/iPhone.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.480]   And it looks pretty good.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.120]   There are a few stores in California.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   Beverly Hills, the Beverly Center, completely out.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.920]   Just tells you how popular it is in certain areas of California.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.840]   But you can go here and see what the availability is.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.040]   In fact, the old looks like the only store that is completely out is the Beverly Center.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.440]   In Simi Valley, they've got their out of everything but the 32 gigabyte black.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.440]   Let's look at Oregon.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.800]   Why would Oregon be out more?
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.640]   No, Oregon's fully in stock.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   So I'm sorry.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   That was Oklahoma.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   No, gay.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.000]   Even in Oregon, they've got stock.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.680]   So I think that that was a temporary issue.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.920]   I think it's actually interesting to look at which ones are sold out.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.000]   The white one is sold out in Irvine.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.200]   The white sold out very-- when I went to get one for Abby, she wanted white.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.520]   And she said, "No, you have to get black.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   We're out of the white."
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.200]   Makes you wonder what--
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   What color is psychology?
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   What color is psychology?
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Psychology is what you're saying.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.240]   Simi Valley, everything is sold out except for the 32 black.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.240]   Black.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.440]   Honolulu, the Royal Hawaiian is sold out-- no, the Kala store is sold out of the 16 gig
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.440]   white.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   This is ridiculous.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.840]   Now, I understand this changes daily, right?
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.080]   They get their shipments in with the daily.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   Let's see in New York.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.320]   Let's see in New York's-- New York-- Oh, Huntington station, Walt Whitman, all sold
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.000]   out as is the West Niac store.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But then--
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Don't you know that, Leo.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Good.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   This is the kind of stuff that our listeners tune in for.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.040]   Next, it'll be school closings.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   We have a snow alert in--
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.680]   Be sure to take your umbrella because we might have rated it at 3 o'clock when you
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.880]   go pick up the kids and watch out for the 405 interchange.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.520]   There's a lot of traffic building up coming back at you with the brand new iPhone availability
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.760]   right here on Backbreak Weekly.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.360]   Larry in Arizona points out they just don't make as many whites because no, but people
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   don't want as many white.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   Right.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   So that's why they sell out, of course.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.480]   Well, you know, we see the thing on Engadget.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.960]   Now, there's a company called Colorware that will give you custom iPhone colors.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   How do they do that?
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.520]   I'm guessing that they just basically buy-- they buy phones.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.720]   They basically do a really good like hard shell repaint job.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.240]   But they have like-- they have really candy apple reds.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.480]   They have deep greens.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.880]   They have lots of primary blues.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   And they can mix them up.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.320]   So you can have like a back case that's red and a home button that's like fire green.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.320]   Fire green.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   I bet there's a metal that burns fire.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   It's fire green.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   It sounds good.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.320]   I like that.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   You're thinking of candy apple red and race car green.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.340]   I mean, I maintain a big savage crack in the corner of my iPhone just to make sure that
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.640]   no one ever takes it by mistake.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.240]   I think this would be the other way of doing it.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.880]   You do that when you get the new iPhone, you just crack it immediately.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.080]   No, no, that's just what I can't have nice things.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.240]   Now, I've been saying-- I've been saying-- I've been getting a lot of heat for this.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.360]   I've been saying we just can't have-- this is why we can't have nice things, Andy and
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.640]   I go, you crack it.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.720]   I've been saying that the iPhone 3GS didn't feel-- I mean, I know it's faster, but didn't
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.000]   feel like it was like, wow, lots faster.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.880]   Everybody's been saying, oh, no, it feels a lot faster.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.400]   Field runners is faster.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.040]   That's all that Alex cares about.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Oh, no.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   How about you, Donnie?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   How would you rate--
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.520]   I am 100% with you, Leo.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.760]   I was quite surprised that it does feel faster, but it's not a quantum leap.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.560]   It's not significantly faster, especially when you're using the menus and things.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.120]   I mean, some of the applications do start a lot quicker and just generally feel faster,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.560]   but it's certainly not this doubled three times the speed type of field in just normal
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   operation.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   Yeah, benchmarks.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:47.360]   Bench
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   That's the way you're doing it.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   It's a good thing.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more, but it's going to be a little bit
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360]   more complicated than it is.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   It's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   It's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   I'm going to say it's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   I would agree.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   It's just a perception thing, isn't it?
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.120]   I suppose it's what you're used to and what applications you use and what operations you
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.360]   do on a constant basis that gives you the comparison.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   It's faster, but for me, it wasn't the huge leap that I was hoping it would be.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   I'm still in love with it.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   I still have a brilliant phone.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   No, it is faster.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   I think when you say two times faster, or when you look at benchmarks, where really, I
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.880]   mean, benchmarks very, very quickly, that's deceptive in the sense that your day-to-day
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.360]   operations may not seem hugely faster.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   Yeah, just a little bit snappier.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Yeah, but that's enough.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   That probably would want to go back to a 3G.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   Yeah, I have to say that.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   So when we come back, Adobe shudders its doors for a week, kind of a shock.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   More iPhone news from Europe, and I'm jealous of this that looks like the EU may force
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   the iPhone to use a micro-USB adapter.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   I would like to see that kind of, sort of.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.360]   And we also, Steve Jobs returns to work.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   But before we do that, time to talk about Zidrobo.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.360]   Oh!
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   The new big Drobo, the grown-up Drobo, the Drobo for people who have more data than they know
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   what to do with people like you, Scott Wilkinson.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   You are a Drobo pro lover.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Scott Wilkinson?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   Scott Warren.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   Who's Scott Wilkinson?
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   Oh, he's the guy on the radio.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.360]   I know too many Scott's.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   I'm being demoted from the panel, I'm going to try and add Scott.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   This is an interesting show.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   I can't change your name because...
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   Leo has been recording a lot of shows lately.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   I haven't saw some.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   He's got many names floating around in his head.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   The Drobo pro has a 8-slot capacity now rather than 4.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   And it is faster, particularly if you use the new connectivity through the network port.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   And it is capable of surviving two drive failures rather than one drive failure, which is what happens on the current Drobo.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   So they're a significant technology advances.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   However, it is not compatible with Drobo's share.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   I thought we should point that out.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   Well, of course you've got the ice-guzzy.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   The ice-guzzy is really brilliant in that.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   Fair trade.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   I wonder, do you think other people will be adopting that, Leo?
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   In fact, in the PC world, are you seeing a lot of ice-guzzy drives, ice-guzzy devices?
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   I think that's really the secret to the Drobo pro's performance.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   When we hear about how fast that interface is for several people have confirmed, it's not like the iPhone.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   It's very noticeable.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   We've been talking a lot about the Drobo.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.360]   It shouldn't be a surprise to you.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.960]   The Drobo is the ultimate external drive.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.520]   The original Drobo with four discs.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.160]   The new Drobo pro with eight discs in it.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   Redundant storage, so you never lose a bit of data.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.720]   Incredible speed.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.080]   Just great for backup storage.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.760]   You can use it to run virtual machines.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:22.080]   It's compatible if you're a Windows user with VMware, Virtual Iron Zen and Microsoft's Hyper-V.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.720]   You can use it with small business server if you're a Windows fan.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   It is a very slick device.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.600]   Is it the first ice-guzzy device in the Mac world?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   I think so.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.960]   I don't think Apple uses ice-guzzy yet.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.080]   That's really slick if you want to try ice-guzzy.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Check it out.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.920]   We've got some special deals on a Drobo.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:47.760]   If you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak, they're through June 30th.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.720]   This is the last day to try that one.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:55.800]   Hurry, that instant $100 rebate on the Drobo itself, the original Drobo, through June 30th.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.040]   But if you go, there's other offers as well, free shipping, instant rebate, so forth.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.120]   Go to Drobo.com/Macbreak and check it out.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.440]   Drobo is powerful stuff.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.880]   Drobo.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   So Steve Jobs is back.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.640]   He's not only was sighted last week.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   He looked healthy.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   He's hanging around.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   He's like, "At work.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.240]   Hopefully it worked now."
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.160]   Has every seen any pictures at all?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.880]   I don't think so.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.400]   No non-PR pictures.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.960]   Have we even seen PR pictures?
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.200]   There were some connected to his...
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.880]   There were some connected to the release, but I don't think that they were actually from
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880]   the time he was current.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   They weren't current.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   No, I don't think so.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.160]   I'm sure they'll sum some will leak out.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.120]   I'm surprised Papa Razzi aren't lurking around one infinite loop trying to snap a shot.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.960]   But of course, he's probably...
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.280]   You know, they have good security.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.360]   You could take one of those Michael Jackson black umbrellas and use those as he sneaks
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   in.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   I don't think so.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   I don't think so.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   We had to find a way to get Michael Jackson.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   Too soon?
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   Was it too soon?
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:04.240]   We needed to get that keyword into the show so that we could...
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.560]   So it looks like he's back though.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.960]   It looks like he's pushing things forward.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.720]   I think that he was probably pretty involved.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   I think so too.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.160]   There's probably like a week where he said, "I'm going to be out.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.080]   I'm having my liver replaced."
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.080]   And I'll be back in a week.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   And I think outside of that, I think it was...
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   Pretty amazing.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   Actually.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   And we wish him best.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   And we're glad he's back.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   Glad that he's back.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.080]   Glad he's looking good and feeling healthy.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.080]   And that's good news.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   I should put more tofu in the apple cafeteria.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.280]   You know, it's interesting to note though that the stock performed well during his absence.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   It sure did.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   It sure did.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   The...
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   You know, prior...
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   When he first...
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   When the rumors came out that he was sick after the, you know, performance where he looked
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   slight.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.080]   The stock was literally going up and down every day depending on what rumor we heard of his
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   health.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:59.280]   Now with him being clear about not being at work and undergoing some medical time off,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.640]   and then, you know, substitutes coming in to take over the company, the stock has flourished.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.120]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.360]   In a time when everybody else...
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.880]   The bell is suffering, yeah.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.600]   So I think that this is a really key turning point for the company because now it's proven
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.040]   that it can survive on Wall Street without Steve at the helm.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:23.280]   This frees him up to do the kind of big picture stuff I think he'd prefer to do and lets the
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.320]   company move forward without having this big hammer over their head.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.040]   Well, what happens if Steve goes away?
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.280]   Well, I think that not only has the stock flourished, but the company's flourished.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.240]   I mean, just the revenue has flourished in his absence.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.560]   You know, I mean, they just keep on piling on.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.480]   I think they've proven they can do very well without him.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.120]   Do you think it's a coincidence that at the same time as that Steve Jobs comes back, that
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.880]   fake Steve Jobs comes back?
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   Any relation?
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   You've got to admit it.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.360]   What do you think Steve Jobs is sick?
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360]   Who got the original liver?
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.400]   I'm saying, what do you think it's fake Steve Jobs where you think Steve got the liver from
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   in the first place?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.680]   It did disappear rather quickly, didn't it?
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   It was part of the deal.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.760]   You know, fake Steve Jobs, you give us your liver and you can continue to blog.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.720]   It's been very clever how they've brought them back in, though, without the huge...
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.080]   Without huge fanfare.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:18.000]   So, you know, there was the liver transplant rumor and he appeared on the PR note when they
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.160]   announced the million iPhones and then another press release that he's now back at work,
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.920]   but he's sort of at work, but still working from home and stuff like that.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.480]   So it's been a very gradual...
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.640]   I mean, they could have had a big fanfare and made a big deal after him coming back,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.960]   but that would probably be the wrong thing to do anyway.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.040]   So they've taken it nice and easy and they've just brought him back in and we'll probably
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.800]   see him in a special event in a couple of months or something.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.760]   So I think they've handled it very well.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.080]   Just to clarify, you're talking about real Steve Jobs, not fake Steve Jobs.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   Oh, sorry.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.960]   No, I think some might have been confused.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.800]   But I think everything you say applies to fake Steve Jobs as well.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.960]   They've brought him in very gracefully returning to his flock.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.680]   Fake Steve Jobs has a great post.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.760]   Clarification, I only have half of Pogues liver.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.920]   He wanted me to have the whole thing, but I was like, "David, seriously, I only need
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   half of it."
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.320]   Seriously, man, after all you've done for me, have you seen my house?
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.320]   Have you seen where I live?
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   Really Steve?
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.240]   Take the whole liver, I mean it.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   Too soon?
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   Moving on.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   He did well.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.840]   It'd be too soon if it was...
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   If something bang on.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   He did well.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:28.080]   Although Dr. Mom points out that the anti-rejection drugs that they give you for this kind of thing
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.720]   typically do plump you up.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.040]   You actually do look hail and hearty as a result.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040]   So...
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.800]   But you feel bloated?
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.160]   You feel a little bloated.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.800]   It's like that time of month.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   Moving on, Adobe.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.280]   Now, I'd like to know what you think of this.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   You work pretty closely with Adobe Alex.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   Closing...
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.120]   Now, I didn't realize they'd done this once before in the spring.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   Closing for a week.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.480]   Just furlowing everybody for a week.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.360]   It's a lot better than the other options.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.480]   But does it mean that Adobe is in really bad shape?
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.880]   No, I think that they had...
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:04.520]   I think Adobe's big problem was is that they had a huge release.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.400]   As we know, a bulk of their income comes from the creative suite line.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.800]   So a lot of the money from the new CS...
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.560]   Whether it's CS3 or CS4, in this case CS4.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.200]   And they're on a very managed schedule.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.440]   It's typically every 18 months I think is when they're releasing a new version.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:30.080]   Well, it turns out that that 18 month cycle came out in the fall of last year when every
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.040]   company is really looking carefully at what they're going to...
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   Where the money's going to go.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.320]   And upgrading from CS3 to CS4 was not one of the priorities when they're trying to keep
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.800]   people in their job.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.920]   And so I think that what happened is that Adobe just hit...
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.560]   They just had a bad hit because they came in at the wrong time.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.240]   If the release had been six months earlier, they probably would have been much better
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.800]   off.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:02.080]   But I think that that has created an issue where they need to make sure that they're not going
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.720]   out of business in any way, shape, or form, but they need to pay attention to it.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.920]   I think that they're doing a lot of prudent things right now to make sure that something
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.200]   that is just...
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.560]   It's a belt tightening at the moment.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.280]   And I don't think it needs to become more acute.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.480]   But I think it's an appropriate measure.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:25.040]   A lot of companies will lay people off and Adobe did do some of that as well.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.920]   But having everyone take a week off is better than laying off another 50 people or something
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   like that or 100 people.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.520]   Well, isn't this something they've done regularly for a while?
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   They have.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   Well, they've done it once before.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.400]   I don't know how many times they did it once this year before.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:42.800]   But John Knack writing in his blog is Adobe Blog.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.360]   I've worked here for nine years.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.560]   The company has done the shutdowns off and on throughout that time, at least since '01
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   or '02.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.600]   You're talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars being saved by one
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   week.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.840]   Well, that's what you do in California.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:01.080]   The governor, Schwarzenegger, closes DMV two Fridays a month and it's millions.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.840]   Huge amount of money.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.160]   It really makes a big difference when it comes to just making sure that...
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.280]   I think it's a soft way of handling a lot of that.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.640]   I do think that Adobe should think about the pricing of its upgrades for the Creative
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   Suite.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:23.120]   I personally think that the pricing for the Creative Suite is too high for the upgrade.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   It's awful.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.760]   I think it makes companies, even like ours, always look at...
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.840]   Do you think revenue is down?
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   Do we know how the revenue is?
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.840]   Well, revenue is down.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   I don't think it's...
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.840]   I don't know what the numbers are, but I'm pretty sure that the revenue...
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:44.000]   It says, "Here it says sales in Adobe's second quarter ending May 29th, fell 21 percent."
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.480]   The company posted its narrow as profit margin in more than three years.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.360]   That's according to Macworld.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:58.440]   I think that oftentimes there's a lot of money that is being left on the table by companies.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   If the upgrade price is too high, companies have to really think hard about, "Do I really
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.240]   want to have the newest version?
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.000]   Do I really need the newest version?"
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.520]   It puts a lot more pressure on the feature set of the new version.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.680]   There's a lot of people who...
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:19.440]   90 percent of what I do in Photoshop I've been doing since version five.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   John also points out that they're putting in a new air conditioner in the Manatee-Tobi
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.360]   building and they couldn't do it, right?
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.760]   They couldn't do it when everybody was there.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.200]   Hey, we kept running while I had the new air conditioning put in.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.600]   How do you like that, by the way?
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   It's very nice.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.000]   I noticed it a little earlier in the show.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I almost brought it up.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.040]   I was like, "It's so cool in here.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.840]   We don't need it today so much, but boy, we need it over the weekend.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   It feels so nice.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   It's really hot.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   We're going to need it in Beijing.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   I have a feeling.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.640]   The weird thing with the Adobe thing, though, is it's...
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.040]   I think Grooba mentioned this as well.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.480]   You can understand it for manufacturing where they actually have a product that they create
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.640]   and there's raw materials that they need to buy and there's wages they have to pay to
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:01.160]   manufacture and ship things out the door that they might have a shutdown period to save
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   some money.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.440]   But in the digital industry where it's mainly bits and bytes and people's creativity and
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.480]   people working to do things, can you ever imagine Apple sort of shutting down for a week?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.960]   Well, it just seems really strange in that particular industry that they might do that,
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.760]   although obviously it does save them money.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.520]   Well, Adobe is considerably smaller than Apple.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   It's only 7,500 employees.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   It's not.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.760]   But on top of everything else, that's kind of interesting that if I had a job like that
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.080]   and I was spontaneously given while we're shutting down for an entire week, yes, I'd
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.240]   probably enjoy the time off, but I also think, wow, I can get a five-day head start on whatever
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   is going to be waiting for me back in my life.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   You would work, wouldn't you?
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   I would work.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   I have to.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.920]   So maybe they're just basically...
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.040]   Maybe it's not such a shutdown as it would be.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   I have not a plan in shutting down for a week.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:50.720]   Yeah, I have to admit, of a lot of the Adobe employees that I know, I will fully expect
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:56.960]   that at least half of them will work at least half of the week that they have off.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.400]   They're not just going to be hanging out because a lot of them are so passionate about what
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.280]   they do that I just think that they're just going to be...
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.400]   Nothing's going to really change that much for them.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.360]   It's really more of a furlough.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:14.160]   He says, John, again, I'm quoting from him quite a bit, but John Knox says, "Adobe offers
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.680]   very generous PTO benefits to the point that people don't use up enough time off.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.400]   A week long shutdown is a way of saying, 'No, seriously, guys, we want you to take some
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   vacation.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.760]   Get out of here, enjoy yourself and come back refreshed.'
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.320]   He says, 'A few time sensitive projects may get permission to work through the break,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.000]   but everyone else is taking the time off.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.360]   The breaks aren't a surprise.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.680]   Most teams build them into their schedule.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.680]   They're not...'
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.960]   So he's kind of saying that the media is building this up as a big deal.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.120]   This is kind of a thing we do regularly.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.680]   It's not such a big deal.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.160]   It's a way of forcing people to take vacations."
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.600]   He says, "Gruber says, 'As a software company, shouldn't every week be a productive week?'
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.400]   And John responds, 'Sure, but I bet you know what it's like to work near holidays.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.560]   It's harder to make progress when a lot of your colleagues are out of the office, as
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.960]   they would be this time of year."
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.040]   He says, 'Why not just schedule the breaks, save a bunch of money on facilities, security,
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.360]   and so forth, and everybody leaves and comes back at the same time.'
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:10.600]   I think you do agree with Alex, though, that one way to potentially buoy what's going on
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   here is, if you look at the cost of photo-related information, you can't get it.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.080]   It's a Photoshop CS4 just to buy it off the street.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.440]   It's one of the more expensive pieces of software you can buy.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:26.240]   I just wonder if you dropped that $100 or $150 with the uptake make up a revenue shortfall
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.400]   that would help.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:34.080]   I guess I wouldn't affect, I wouldn't change the retail price of a new copy.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.840]   The thing that I think that they could get more aggressive about is the upgrade price
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.080]   for people who already own it.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.960]   You already have people in the pipe.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.240]   I don't remember what the upgrade was, but I know that we were looking at it.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.200]   It's just a lot of money to upgrade for.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:56.080]   Especially, if you're a corporation that has a lot that has five or ten or a hundred seats,
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.560]   you start multiplying that against the upgrade.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   It starts turning into real money real fast.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   That's the issue.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.080]   Then you really have to think hard about whether...
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   I haven't upgraded.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   I'm still using four.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   I'm using three.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   CS3.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   We have upgraded all the machines.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   We have upgraded...
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   Three is good enough for me.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:20.080]   I think that's the issue that they have, is that three was a great upgrade.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   Four is great too, but it is...
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:31.800]   A lot of people also skip, if they buy in three, they'll wait for the five.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.520]   I know a lot of people that don't necessarily upgrade every single version.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.560]   Plus, you're a pre-pressed house that has to stay current with all your clients.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]   It just gets...
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.520]   That's the issue.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.200]   I just think that a lot...
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.560]   We get pretty aggressive with our software about giving people who have already purchased
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   our software one.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.520]   It's a pretty darn good deal to upgrade because we just want to keep them in the family.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.240]   We want them to keep them using the most current version.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.800]   That's what we're seeing Apple do with the newest version of Snow Leopard, where we're
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.760]   talking about $29.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.120]   That's a great way to keep everybody in the fold.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.760]   We're going to take a break here and come back with our picks of the week.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.120]   I don't know if you have one prepared, Don, but I bet you do.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   Yes.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   All right.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.920]   Don McAllister is with us from ScreenCastsOnline.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.080]   He's going to be heading to China in just a couple of days as am I.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.120]   Andy and Akko will meet us there.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.320]   He's with the Chicago Sun Times, but we will have a show next week for sure with Alex and
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.600]   Scott and Andy, and probably the week after as well, Alex, unless you have a baby.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.440]   Unless I have a baby, I'm here.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   Ready to roll.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   I won't.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   Any minute now.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   I will.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   Take pictures though.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.440]   With my new 5D mark too.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:48.080]   The pictures that you took of you and Carlita's first child raised the bar quite a bit.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   They sure did.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   Those are amazing.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.440]   They have very high hopes for this next set.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.400]   Alex took a few weeks off and just took pictures the whole time and they're incredible pictures.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:04.560]   I've been taking, I've been really warming up with the 5D and I'm pretty excited about
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.080]   the next round.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.800]   We are going to come back with our picks.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.720]   As I said, Scott Born also here from what site are we plugging for you, Scott, these
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   days?
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.200]   Oh, you know, photofocus.com.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   That's just fine.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.400]   Or just go to scottborn.com, which collects my life stream.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   Thank you.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   I'm not going to China though.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.400]   I'm not.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   He's going to stay here.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   I know my rights.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:32.800]   You don't have to go to China unless Scott and less Don Andy and I can't get back.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.320]   Then I will come get you.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   And then you and your team of green berets or Texas Rangers or whatever it is.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.800]   Well, that's a ball team.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.200]   Airborne Rangers will come and get us.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.160]   I will send people to get you, but remember.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.560]   Please don't send the Texas Rangers for us.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   Okay.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   Boy, there's so many jokes.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   I know.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   I'm just not going to.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.720]   Just do me a favor because that's a really big favor I have to use up.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.600]   So if you're trying not to.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.600]   No, you want to save it for when you get captured.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   Thank you.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   You don't want to waste it on us.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.440]   Kind of my thinking, but you know, I'm not going to let my friends language.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Here's the deal.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.240]   I'll make you a deal, Scott.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.200]   Give it six months to a year.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   Okay.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.840]   If they don't get it, you know, if we're still there in a year, then okay.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   No, no, no.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.800]   You know what? I'm not coming in here and filling in for you for that.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   For a year.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   Forget it.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   I'm coming here.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   Or if you hear the term hard labor, okay?
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   Just think of all the way.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   I got news for you.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.800]   That's all they got in China.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   Oh boy.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   There's no easy labor.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   Oh boy.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.600]   See if I had that, I'd be like, wow, I get in a really good shape.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   Hey, do you have any bricks?
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   I can lift.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   Come on.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   I'm ready to.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   That's not enough.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   Give me a bigger.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   This is only a five pound hammer.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.800]   I'm just going to tell him as long as you let me listen to us.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.160]   Audible books, I'll break any rocks you want.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.240]   That's all I guess.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.200]   The thing I fear the most in life is not hard labor is not imprisonment.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   It's boredom.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.680]   We're already looking forward to all the endorsement deals.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   We're going to be lining up.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.320]   I don't have my big book deal.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.640]   Well, only one thing kept me alive during those 11 months of isolation.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.960]   The good, hot taste of quick or quick goes.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.520]   It's a marketing proof.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.480]   It's no, it's a taste and good for you.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.200]   You think Andy of all the great novels that were written in jail cells, it's really an
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.160]   opportunity to finally write that novel you've been working on.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.400]   And it won't be like Solzhenitsyn in the Gulag.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.840]   It's nice and toasty warm.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.160]   It's like it's like Central America.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   Except for winter.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.320]   Maybe Scott will get us out before winter.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   That's another thing.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   Snow, no snow.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.320]   I'm just hoping I don't have to get you out at all.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   You won't.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.760]   Actually, our pick, our Audible pick of the week in this regard should be bailout nation
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.160]   by Barry Realtz.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.000]   But that's not going to be our pick because I'm sure Andrew has something great.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.360]   Let me just mention Audible.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.440]   I have stocked up.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.880]   I have loaded up my iPhone.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.520]   I've got gigabytes of audio books, which means really hundreds, not hundreds, but dozens
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:05.000]   of books because you can get a ton of audio books on your iPhone, your iPod, your Zoom.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.440]   Should you have one, your Kindle, a variety of devices and great listening, whether I'm
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:17.160]   at the gym commuting, driving around doing shopping, doing housework or on a 17 hour plane
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.280]   flight as I'm contemplating on Thursday.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.040]   This is a lifesaver.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.280]   Yeah, me too.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   This is a book I'm recommending that I have not listened to or read yet because this is
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.800]   one of the titles that last week I started banking for that 17 18 hour flight.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.440]   But it sounds so interesting.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:41.080]   It's by, whoops, switch to a different window there.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   I have it here.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   I have it here.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   There you go.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:50.360]   It's called the food of younger land, the WPA's portrait of food in pre world world to
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.560]   World War II America.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.440]   I've read other Mark Kirlansky books.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   He is great.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.240]   He is a food historian.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.480]   He wrote a book all about how all of world's history and society's development is tied
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.800]   to salt and codfish.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   I have salt.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.120]   Yeah, on my iPod.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.520]   And it sounds like that crazy that that crazy theory that your rich uncle has that identifies
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.640]   him as your crazy uncle over God's sake.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   It's all about salt.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.520]   Don't give him fish because he'll he'll spend your for three hours of.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.320]   You know, the cod.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.640]   Oh, you know, Massachusetts is the land of the cod.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   I love cod.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.320]   Caught hanging in the state house.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.040]   But what I'm saying is he'll take this this this topic and he really, really prosecuted
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.840]   and really make it sound interesting.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.400]   He was doing research for another food related book and he was in the National Archives and
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.200]   he came across an abandoned project from the WPA.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.320]   This is when after the Great Depression that the government decided to take it in their
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.920]   own hands to put people back to back to work.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.240]   One of the groups of people they wanted to put back to work were writers.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.160]   And so they had a project where they would simply hire writers who instead of having
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   to break rocks for a living, we will give you an assignment to write about stuff.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.000]   One of these projects starting in 1939 was to.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.400]   And this sounds like someone making something up at the end of a Friday wanted to go away
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   for a long weekend.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.200]   About a massive documentation of the food habits of the entire country.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   Just go.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   Just write.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.520]   Some of the greatest writers alive at that time just wrote about food, regional food,
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.000]   like food where they were.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.360]   John Cheever, Zora Neal Hurston, your Dora Welty.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.520]   I mean, this is amazing.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.880]   It's amazing to see.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.160]   And again, all I've read is the preview that's available through a download of the preview
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.720]   that you can get from through the Amazon Kindle.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.040]   And just the first chapters make it makes it sound so interesting because it's not it's
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.280]   against not just about, you know, here is a recipe for apple pie, dowdy.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   Submitted by Miss Odila.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.360]   It's, you know, it's about the stories about because 1939 was an interesting part where,
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.360]   yeah, of course, there's lots of immigration, but that was going on for 10 or 15 years.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.280]   But this is when you start to see, well, here are the effects of immigration.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.600]   Here's what's what each individual region of America was dealing with and listening to.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.920]   Here's how food was prepared and consumed back then because again, that was probably
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.520]   the last period before commercial food distribution really took off because all food back then
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.760]   was local food.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   Right.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.400]   If you fat they had fast food back then, but it was still grown on a local farm prepared
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.600]   hot to order just an hour earlier.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:24.160]   But it's so cool when you're reading about someone in Vermont who is in Vermont and he's
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.840]   she's writing about ravioli and it's such an exotic food item that she feels she has
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.880]   to explain what ravioli is.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.600]   And so I'm really looking again, I've only read maybe a chapter or two out of it.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.640]   And I'm really looking forward to taking a look through it and seeing exactly how well
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.600]   this works up because it seems like an amazing document of again life in 1939 out.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.800]   It was written from 1939 to 1942 because after Pearl Harbor, they started saying, well,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.160]   you know what, I think they're better things the government could be spending its money
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   on.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   There are other ways to lift ourselves.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.840]   We're now we're now paying people to build guns and build tanks.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.560]   So I think the economy is going to do okay.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.240]   So as a matter of fact, this whole book project was left unfinished and pretty much undiscovered
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.620]   until Kirlansky again was just researching something else and came across these yards
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.940]   and yards of files of things that these people had written.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.380]   So it's not necessarily the book that would have been produced by this project so much
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.860]   as this guy looking through everything that was written and then producing a book about
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.820]   this project, including a lot of the best content that was written for it.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.860]   So again, I can, it's one of those things where I know it's on my iPhone.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:24.860]   I know it could start.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:27.860]   I'm going to do lots of driving and lots of errands the next week and have.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.860]   I know that I could listen to it in the next week, but I'm saying no Andy, 17 hours on
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.300]   a plane, you're on an aisle seat, but that's as good as you get.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.620]   So come on, you're going to need to hold on to this be good.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.060]   Hey, really, that's true.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.460]   Now you don't have to dole these out.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.100]   You can get your first book free right now.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.580]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak, sign up for the gold account and your first book is
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.660]   free a great choice.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:51.940]   The food of a younger land, WPA's portrait of food in the pre World War II America.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940]   I'm going to get this.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.540]   I have his book on salt, which is fantastic, but I have to get this as well.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.500]   Mark Kirlansky, the author, and we thank audible for supporting us.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.020]   We really appreciate the support they've shown for this show and all of the Twitter networks
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:12.940]   so we invite you if you haven't tried audible yet, support them for supporting us audible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.060]   How long is your flight, Don?
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:20.380]   Yeah, it's, let's see, we go from Manchester to Helsinki, which I like about a two and
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   an hour.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.380]   Yeah, I know.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.820]   On Finner and that's two and a half hours and then a short stop over in Helsinki and
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.540]   then I think it's about a seven or eight hour flight from Helsinki director.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.540]   That's not too bad.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.220]   I presume they fly east, not west.
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:37.660]   Yeah, goes right over the top of Russia and down into into China.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.740]   So your flight is actually shorter than ours because I have an 11 flight to our flight
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:46.580]   to Tokyo, two hour layover and then a four hour flight to Beijing.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.420]   Mine is nonstop New York to Beijing.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.220]   And how long is that?
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.020]   That's, again, it's like 17 hours.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.420]   It's like 14, 15 hours.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.660]   It's like, I'm thinking about all the different ways you can die in a flight by sitting in
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.860]   one position for more than 45 minutes.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.860]   So that's true.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860]   You got to get up and move.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.860]   If I were not on the aisle seat, I'd be like, excuse me, pardon me.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.860]   I have people who want to kill me in that aisle by the end of the flight.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.860]   Okay, I guess I'm sorry.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   Wake up.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.860]   I feel just want to kill all the people that are trapped against the wall in your.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.860]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.660]   All you have to all you have to remember is that you should drink four liters of water
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.860]   during the flight because that'll keep you getting up.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.860]   Well, yeah, because there's no, there's no, no, it makes it a natural reaction.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.660]   No, it also keeps you really heavily hydrated.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.500]   I drink every every ounce of water that someone brings to me on a long flight.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.140]   I will drink just to make sure that I stay hydrated.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.140]   That's your number one problem.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:43.060]   That's what gives you all most of most of your jet lag will be dehydration.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.220]   But everybody who travels or spends any time sitting in the same position should move around
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.620]   because of those leg, those blood clots you can get.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.700]   And it really is a risk, huge risk on these flights.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.700]   So do it.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   I don't know.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.900]   It's a huge risk, but it's a, ahh, speaker than you think.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.300]   No, it's bigger than you think.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.300]   Right.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.500]   Of course you fly a lot.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.660]   So, you know, you probably have some routine.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.220]   You've probably clench your calves or something.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.380]   I just get up a lot.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.380]   That's what you're supposed to do.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.380]   Your calves.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:17.580]   No, I, I, I get up and stretch actually a lot, um, to, in the back in the back alley.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.740]   And the doctor mom says tight support hose.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.940]   We're back, we're back on underwear.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.900]   I don't know how that happened.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.340]   I don't wear, I don't wear any hose.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.340]   I just wouldn't.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.860]   No, no, no, no, tight support hose for me.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.100]   You go for the full thong, just, you know, free and easy.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:36.180]   I am not going to go there.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.180]   Okay.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.980]   And the, you, you get to, you, actually you just did a pic.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.420]   So I'm not going to pick on you first.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   Let's start, you know what?
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.540]   Let's start with the, the new kid, Don McAllister.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.540]   What is your pick of the week?
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540]   Pick of the week.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540]   All right.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.060]   Then well, I've just, uh, delved into my, uh, suite of utilities and, uh, actually it's
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.500]   unusual on this one because it's, um, it's a, a Mac application, but for the price of
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   an iPhone app.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.660]   Very small utility, but very useful.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.860]   Uh, it's called fee-wee.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:06.340]   Now fee-wee is a, uh, just a small application that allows you to, well, you know when you
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.980]   have the finder open, um, invariably when you're using the finder, you always want to open
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:10.980]   a second finder window.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.420]   No matter what you do in a dime.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   Yes.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.420]   Because you want to copy one to the other.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.420]   That's right.
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   You just want a second finder window.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.420]   So you've got to go up or you, you know the keystrokes, you can do the keystrokes, then
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.420]   rearrange the windows.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.820]   Well, this allows you to just click on the application and it will instantly launch
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:29.020]   two finder windows either in a row configuration or in a column configuration.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.140]   And then you can just, you know, use them as two separate finder windows.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.860]   Sounds very simple, but when you actually start to use it, it's a great boon.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:40.820]   Um, and you can also do things like if you want to create, um, the two windows up in
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.380]   the top right hand corner of your screen, you can actually pre-configure them and then
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.620]   click on the setup utility and it will remember those windows positions so that next time when
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.020]   you want to open two finder windows, it will open in the same position.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.020]   Oh, I like this.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.220]   The recently also extended it to support other applications as well.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.100]   So you might want two Safari windows or two other applications that you have running as
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100]   well.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100]   I'm trying to find them.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   How do you spell fee-wee?
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100]   Right.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.100]   It's fee-wee.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   F-I-W-I.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.540]   The URL is a bit convoluted.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:12.100]   It's at wordpower-software.com and it's /wordpower/fee-wee.html.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   There we go.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   That's the one.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.100]   Cool.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.580]   Oh, that sounds like a really, and it's 99 cents.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   99 cents, yeah.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.900]   And there's a little screencast done by somebody from the UK.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.100]   I don't know who that would.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.100]   Oh, is that...
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.780]   Oh, you so you actually never had to use it.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   That's great.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.220]   And the half updated it since I did that screencast, but you'll get a quick idea of what it's
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.660]   all about and say it was quite a while ago actually that I did that.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.580]   You had December '08, I did that.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.740]   So there's been a few improvements since then, but it's a good little utility.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.580]   It sounds like something I really could use very handy because you're exactly right.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.780]   I always do open two windows at the same time.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.700]   Alex Lindsey, you're next.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.820]   So this one you're going to have to take to China.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.220]   Okay, I'm doing it.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.820]   And I really should have...
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.060]   I should say this one on this week in photography, but I'm going to say it here because this
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.220]   is where I'm at.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.580]   And this one is the most magical app on the iPhone as far as I'm concerned.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.580]   Most magical.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.860]   And I want to thank Stu Mashiwets, who was the one who actually posted this on his Twitter
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:14.940]   and I downloaded it.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:17.660]   And it is crazy, crazy cool.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.580]   So what it's called, it's called auto stitch.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:24.380]   And auto stitch is a panorama program for your iPhone.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:30.180]   You can simply snap a couple photos in here.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.580]   So I can simply take my, for instance, take my iPhone and I'm in my photo app, not an
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.660]   auto stitch.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:41.580]   And I can simply just start snapping photos.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   And like this.
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.420]   So you're shooting a panorama moving.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   I just moved on.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   I'm rotating the camera.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.100]   And you don't have to have a tripod on.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.100]   No tripod.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.340]   This thing is crazy.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   All right.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.780]   So then I go into auto stitch.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   It's not panorama.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.260]   There's a couple of other ones that do this.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.740]   The auto stitch is definitely the best one.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.740]   I go into my camera roll.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.980]   It sees the camera roll that I just took.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.820]   And I can just click on the photos.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.420]   I just tap on them to the ones that I want.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.660]   It's going to load all of those in.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.380]   And this is the first time you really get what you're holding is a...
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.380]   It's much more powerful.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.380]   It's a real computer.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.380]   Now this doesn't require the 3GS.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.380]   But it doesn't require the 3GS.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.500]   I'm just saying that you just realize you're really dealing with a real computer because
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:30.020]   I started doing panoramas in 1994.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   By hand.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:35.260]   Oh, well, it was using QuickTime VR lab.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   Right.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   And it was a...
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:42.780]   It wasn't rocket science, but it was starting to approach it to get it all done correctly.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:47.500]   And now the idea that I can shoot this with an iPhone without a tripod, without a calibrated
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.940]   tripod.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:49.940]   And here is...
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:50.940]   Hold on.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.940]   It's just a...
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:52.940]   It's going to show us is...
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940]   Where should I point it?
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.860]   Show it to your camera straight ahead.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860]   Most people are listening anyway.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.860]   By the way, there's...
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860]   You're doing the same thing.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.980]   Selling mosey, making millions of dollars.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.980]   So there's...
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.980]   There's the...
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.900]   Oh, look at that.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   There's the piano.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.900]   Wow.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   Now, as with always...
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.900]   See, you do this kind of thing.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900]   You get a strange shaped picture.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.900]   Is there any way to crop it down to a scooter or a rectangle?
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.900]   Not...
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.100]   What's missing in this application is there's no crop built in.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:20.300]   Now, if you bring it into iPhoto or you bring it into something else, you can definitely
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.300]   do that later.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.300]   Right.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   You know what I mean?
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.300]   It's something that...
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.220]   I was kind of surprised that it doesn't have a crop feature to it.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   So you end up...
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.380]   This one, if you shoot it well, you end up with not much black area.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.420]   You'll see this is...
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.140]   You'll see that there's a little bit of a waviness to it.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.900]   If you hold it kind of carefully.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   You know what I mean?
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.180]   Or you rotate it on an axis as you would kind of with a regular...
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.220]   You're tempted to go like this.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.380]   When you shoot a panorama handheld, you're tempted to go like this.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.540]   Just swing it around.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.540]   That's not what you want to do.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.100]   In the words, you rotate on your axis.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.300]   You rotate the camera like the camera on the phone axis.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:56.820]   And the closer you rotate the phone axis, the less parallax you're going to get and the
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.460]   less weirdness you're going to get.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.180]   If you're just a little bit concentrated on it and the panos that come out of this are
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.180]   fantastic.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.180]   I mean, they just...
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.100]   Especially with the larger, you know, the more the higher pixel phone.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.780]   I mean, we use it a lot for now for like we go to a location that we have to shoot, you
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.060]   know, in a week or whatever.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.260]   I'll go in and I'll just shoot panos from all the corners and sit there and stitch them
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.260]   up.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.260]   It's really...
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.980]   I think this is something I'd like to take to China.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.820]   And then I can use some of these...
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.220]   You know, I've set up all these pipelines to various places so that I can upload these
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.740]   pictures and get them on the blog.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.500]   I think I'm going to probably use Postorus to do this and then have it go from there
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500]   to my blog or friends.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   Right.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.060]   And a lot of blogging tools will let you do a crop on the photo that you look at.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   You can load in.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.500]   So you could probably do the crop right there.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.300]   But it's just a great way to get a pano.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.860]   And I just can't believe that I can do it on my iPhone.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.100]   That's all I have to say.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.820]   So anyway, it's pretty slick.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:54.980]   And once again, it's by Cloudburst Research and it's called Auto Stitch, $1.99.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   $99.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.980]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.980]   Mr. Scotty Borne.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.340]   Have you a pick for us today?
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.340]   I do.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.460]   And it's a non-characteristically inexpensive pick.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.020]   That's $1.99 as well.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.020]   Wow.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.460]   We got cheap programs.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.460]   So fun.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.460]   I think that's what it is.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   Anyway, and I did pay.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.500]   So far we spent five bucks if you bought everything.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.900]   I paid for this.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.540]   No one sent it to me.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.100]   It's from TM Soft.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100]   It's called White Noise.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.940]   It's an iPhone app.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:34.500]   And I cannot really, I just can't even dread to think about another airplane conversation
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.020]   where I'm sitting in front of four valley girls.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.020]   Oh, I hate it.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:41.300]   Who have not seen each other in seven years.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.940]   And so this goes into my noise canceling headphones.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:45.940]   And then I'm safe.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.900]   And you can pick all these different cool sounds.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.580]   And it even has cool pictures.
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.060]   Oh, for somebody who's had four liters of water, the running water sound.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.060]   That's really good.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.900]   Might be really appropriate.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.620]   There's the oscillating fan one is one of my favorites.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.620]   You're kidding.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.020]   No, I love that one.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.020]   It's got a little picture of a fan that comes on.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.140]   So you just select the sound that you want.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.340]   You can control the volume.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.900]   You can set a timer.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.060]   There's a catalog of a bunch of different sounds.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.740]   I've got to get this for the plane too.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.740]   Look at that.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.740]   There's like 40 of them.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.900]   Now, if you set the timer, what happens at the end of the timer?
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:18.900]   It goes off.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.020]   You mean the sound stops?
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.180]   It doesn't like pizziz you or something.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.180]   It's not a pizziz.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180]   No.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.180]   And you'll need to reference Mac break weekly number seven if you want to know what we're
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.340]   talking about folks in any event.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.220]   It is not a pizziz device.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.380]   It is simply a noise generator.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.820]   But here's something I want to point out.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.060]   You've probably been to one of those mall stores where they sell these little cheap gadgets
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.300]   that allegedly make white noise.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.580]   The thing I like about this is it's extremely well recorded sound.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.460]   And those of us on this show are kind of into that.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.140]   The audio here is superb.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.900]   That's important because I don't want to hear eight bit sound of a, you know, it's
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:14:59.900]   just a story.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.900]   No, no, no.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:01.900]   This is high quality sound.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.540]   It's two bucks worth.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:08.100]   If you have something like the Bose QuietComfort twos or QuietComfort threes and you add this
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.980]   to it, you're not going to hear the Valley girls behind you.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.460]   That was the worst plane flight I ever had.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.900]   I forgot my animotics headphones and I had to listen to the person sitting behind me.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.900]   It was awful.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:22.500]   See, I have, I have, I have, I use this really high quality sound when I, when I want to
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.500]   block stuff out, it's called music.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.100]   Well, I understand, but here's my problem, Alex.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:31.180]   I, I got this weird kind of like brain dyslexia.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.900]   I can't read and listen to music at the same time.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.100]   No, I actually, I, I can't either.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   You're right.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100]   I was giving you a hard time.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.660]   I actually listened to my, my answer to this is mostly African music because I don't know
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.660]   what they're saying.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660]   Right.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   So I, so you know what?
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.300]   The best music and then this research, uh, proves this is Baroque classical Baroque music
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:51.540]   is the best for getting work done for effectiveness, uh, writing, whatever you're doing.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.700]   Just Baroque, Little Bach, Corelli, just in the background, Little, Little, Little
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   Paco Bell's, man, Paco Bell's.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.820]   Yeah, I can't read anything if I'm listening to music.
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:02.180]   So if I want to be on the plane and read, I use this for white noise.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:06.860]   And if I'm not reading, then sure, I just grab my iPhone and pick some music, uh, and,
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:07.860]   and go.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   But, uh, I don't know.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.780]   I just thought it was really clever how they did it.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.420]   They could have, you know, for a couple of bucks, they could have gotten away with a
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.700]   lot less, but they really, I mean, this is somebody who, yeah, this is somebody who had
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.340]   a real passion for this.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:26.660]   And I can't, I gotta say, the whole notion of iPhone apps is really starting to intrigue
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.740]   me how cool they are and what, what kind of things they can do.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.180]   But this also works, by the way, on the iPod touch.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.380]   Well, and also with a little speaker system, this is great for when you have babies and
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.180]   kids and that you want to block out the outside sound just a little bit so they don't wake
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.180]   up so easily.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.260]   It's, uh, it's also a good thing.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.260]   So how do I play it?
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.260]   I've got it on my screen.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.260]   How do I make it play?
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.260]   Do I have to set a timer to make it play?
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.660]   You have to go to the catalog.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.260]   And then you select one of the sounds and then you touch it.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.260]   And that's it.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.260]   Well, I see.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.260]   It's not turned up.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.260]   Maybe it turned up.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.260]   There we go.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.260]   Shoot me after go to the bathroom.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.940]   How many liters of water have you had today?
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.300]   Oh, that's good.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.300]   That's running water.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.220]   Let me, there's a sprinkler.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.220]   That's cool.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.580]   Oh, the off leg fan.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.620]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at it.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.140]   Oh, yeah, that's what I want to hear.
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.500]   It sounds like a Mac truck back about it.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.940]   Really, you find that soothing.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.940]   I do.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   I don't know why.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.660]   Rain on the car roof.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.660]   This is great.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.660]   I love this.
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.260]   That one kind of bugs me for some reason.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.260]   Well, this kid, what's got something for everybody?
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.100]   Yeah, there's 40 different sounds.
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.100]   Wow.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.820]   Light rain with birds.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.260]   Heavy rain pouring.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.900]   Extreme rain pouring.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.140]   City streets.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.140]   Dishwasher.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.340]   Hair dryer blowing.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.500]   That's so funny.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.500]   I love it.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.700]   Oh, now it's not gonna stop.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.900]   Oh, good.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.060]   So I've now purchased auto stitch and white noise.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.660]   And that's an expensive show for you.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:53.980]   Yeah, I spent $5.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   I bought a...
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   I guess what?
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:58.900]   I just got an EVV developer saying we just updated white noise.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.620]   Well, look at that.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:04.140]   Oh, yeah, that would be the way it would work, wouldn't it?
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.380]   So this is something I'm bringing to China.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.580]   And I just found out about this from Chris Markhart.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.340]   He of course does tips from the top floor, the photo podcast.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:20.540]   And he's just started doing a podcast, a daily tip podcast, which is Chris photo...
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.540]   Oh, boy.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.500]   Now I forgot the name.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.500]   So I just got tips with Chris.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.500]   I got something like that.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.340]   Anyway, if you go to Chrismarkhart.com.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.500]   But you could find it.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.580]   But the way he's doing this is with a program for the iPhone called Audio Boo.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.980]   Have any of you heard of that?
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.780]   Audio Boo.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:44.580]   So I've been looking along with you, Don, at ways that we can kind of live blog this whole
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:45.580]   thing.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:48.140]   And I've got the pictures and I've got the blogging and I've got the video.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.180]   But I hadn't really thought about just doing a plain audio one as well.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:54.100]   And this will allow you to go to an iPhone app, goes on your iPhone.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:58.100]   You start it, you have to set up a free account at audioboo.com.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.220]   And then you just press record.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.500]   And then the start button.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.660]   And now I'm record...
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.900]   Three, two, one.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.980]   Hello.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:14.740]   This is Leo Le Porte broadcasting from the Tiananmen Square in beautiful Beijing, California.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   And then...
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.420]   And then I press stop.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   And then I press publish.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.300]   Now this publishes it up to the audioboo server automatically.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   Are you sure that's not audioboo.fm?
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.300]   I'm sorry.fm.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.300]   Did I say .com?
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.300]   Yes, it's not .com.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.300]   It's .fm.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:37.660]   And then I'm going to type a title for this, which is another stupid test.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.580]   It uploads very fast.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.980]   And you can attach a picture to it if you want.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   Tag.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   And now I'm going to upload it.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   All right.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:46.980]   Now you...
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.980]   And then I'm going to type a second thing.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:48.980]   And it is...
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:52.060]   And three, two, one.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.820]   It is now published audioboo.com.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.020]   And people can subscribe to it.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.580]   There's an RSS feed.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.660]   I'm going to pump it into friend feed or my post-risk blog.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.180]   So it'll automatically go there and then go from there to my other stuff.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:09.020]   This is part of the fun of setting all this up is figuring out how to get everything all
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.020]   talking to one another.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.300]   Now let me go to audioboo.fm.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:18.100]   Is there a way to subscribe just to your boos?
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   It basically turns into a podcast.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.380]   There's an RSS feed you could subscribe to that would just be my boos.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.780]   That sounds bad, doesn't it?
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:26.780]   It does.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.780]   And we brought this site.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.940]   But it's pretty much compared to everything else on this show.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.940]   It's pretty...
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:32.940]   I think there is a site.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:33.940]   All right.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.780]   Now let me go see my boos.
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.620]   B-O-O-S.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:44.820]   And you can also see a list of other people's boos, popular boos, featured boos, recent
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.820]   boos.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:51.100]   I just love the idea that I can do this right from the iPhone and that they do the hosting.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.100]   The file size is fairly small.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.100]   Okay.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.100]   The new one that I just posted isn't up yet, but I'll play one that I did right before
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.100]   the show.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.700]   And this is what's kind of surprising.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.980]   The quality is pretty good.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.540]   Better than I would have thought.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.180]   Let's see, playing.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.820]   Is the boos playing?
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:13.740]   No, I had such trouble with my audio on this machine.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.380]   I guess my audio is not coming out of the machine.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.380]   Oh, well.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.380]   Hello, everybody.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.380]   This is Leo.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:26.700]   And I'm just recording a little bit of a sample recording from audio boo because I want to
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.980]   use this a little bit later on in Macbreak Weekly just to see how good it actually sounds.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   Does that sound good?
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.060]   Does it sound like you want a phone?
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.740]   It compresses it as an MP3.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:41.180]   People can download it, comment on it, subscribe to your boos.
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.820]   And I think this is very cool.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.140]   I didn't get the press.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.140]   Think of buck 99, maybe 499.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.700]   It's not expensive as with all.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.580]   I just come through on the main site, Leo.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.820]   It's just your last one is just appeared.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.820]   It just appeared.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.820]   All right.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.820]   Yeah, it just takes a little while to get through.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.820]   So let me go back to my boos.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.300]   But that's pretty cool.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:00.540]   So I can be, you know, I was trying to think, how can I do, for instance, I want to do on
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.020]   the radio show, I want to do some reports from China and Japan and Korea.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.020]   So now I can, I think it quality.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   Not born.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   Send somebody.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   All right.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   Here's the test I just did.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.020]   Let's play this one.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.500]   See how this sounds.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.740]   I was a little careful to not over modulate it.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:20.940]   It tells you when it was uploaded two minutes ago.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.260]   It also puts your location on there, which is kind of cool.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.140]   You'll be able to see my exact location.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.140]   Takes a second to play.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.140]   I guess that's what was going on.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.900]   It's just a slight delay.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.980]   I mean, I could do this with this is Leo Leport broadcasting from the book.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:39.700]   From the Tiananmen Square in beautiful Beijing, California.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.700]   Pretty surprising.
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.700]   And that's awesome.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.620]   But that's just the mic in your, that's the phones.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:47.700]   The phones, the phone's mic is better than I would have thought.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.340]   So they compress it on the phone and then upload it.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.060]   So there are sites down those.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:59.140]   Yeah, it's a little slow, unfortunately, because, well, we're sending a lot of people
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.060]   there right now.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.700]   But audioboo.com, it'll just be one more little piece in my toolkit.
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.540]   I mean, after all, I can't shoot video.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.300]   It's a little harder to shoot the video.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.540]   And the thing is you can be more surreptitious if you're talking to your phone as you walk.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.540]   Right.
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.540]   It just looks like you're talking to your phone.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.540]   You're not being followed by a man in a very large black suit.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:22.140]   Scott, send the Texas Rangers.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:25.940]   Except for that lousy left handed picture, he's not going to be any help.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:26.940]   All right.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:30.980]   So, finally, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:34.260]   Andy and not who?
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:38.100]   I feel sort of encouraged now to actually choose something that costs a lot of money,
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.820]   because this is like the only five dollar.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.420]   It's a cheap sketch.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.900]   It's a rare occasion when Andy not goes.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.900]   The guy who has like the most expensive thing.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.340]   Let me, I have to correct myself.
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.180]   Audioboo is free.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.180]   Wow.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.100]   There's not even like a monthly charge for hosting your files.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.100]   Apparently not.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.100]   Wow.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.100]   Okay.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.100]   Okay, go lower than that and I'll go.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.180]   Oh, no, I just know, every time I hear about a service like that, I'm like, that sounds
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.780]   like a really great service for the eight months that's going to be an operation before
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780]   they realize.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.780]   Well, I know.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.340]   I almost would prefer that they charge exactly right.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.620]   They'll do premium services at some point, right?
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620]   That's idea.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.660]   As a matter of fact, I did have a free thing lined up, actually more of a web service.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.140]   But I'll hold that for next week, since I will definitely be here next week.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.460]   It will still be very, very appropriate because it's China related.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.380]   But I have to send this back tomorrow and this is the Amazon Kindle DX.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.380]   Glint Glint.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:31.380]   Oh, the big one.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.380]   The big one.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:37.740]   I mean, I was talking to a, another Mac journalist in publishing and he was saying, well, what
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:42.700]   an odd way to like come up with the next edition of something with a tagline is now it's even
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:45.460]   bigger and more expensive.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:51.180]   And honestly, I wasn't like, when I first heard about it and first, you know, got the,
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.900]   got the, got the briefing on it.
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.500]   And I was like, okay, well, I mean, it's bigger and it's faster and there's more storage.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:02.780]   Now it has four gigabytes of storage of which maybe three gigs are available to the user.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.220]   And of course, has a bigger screen.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.180]   But kind of like with the, as with the original Kindle, when I didn't really get it until I
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.020]   used it on a daily basis, I really got what the Kindle DX is all about.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:17.260]   Forget about all of the other features and just focus on the fact that it has built in
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.900]   native support for Adobe PDF.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:24.460]   And that really changes everything about how you can use this device on the original, on
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.300]   the other two, the first generation and second generation kindles, which in the second generation,
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:35.980]   of course, is still available for 359, about 120, 130 bucks less than the $489 Kindle DX.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.180]   You can email documents to the device.
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:42.940]   You can copy documents over by docking it via USB.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:48.220]   And matter of fact, applications like stanza will convert documents that you have into
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.220]   native Kindle book format.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:54.660]   But you were talking about your basic dumb ebook format formatting, one single column
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:26:02.260]   of text with occasional breaks for a picture to you can email a PDF to a Kindle and software
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:09.020]   at Kindle.com will transmogrified into a format that is sufficiently dumb down for this device.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:13.020]   But it never comes out anywhere near what it looked like when it left your desktop.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.140]   But this is like real absolute actual PDF.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.780]   This is a comic book.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:24.100]   Issue number one of why the last man, which you can download from DC Comics.com.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:27.980]   And it just displays it without any problems whatsoever.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.260]   Page by page turned by turn.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.460]   Once again, it's not transmogrifying it at all.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:35.460]   This is just how fast it can do a PDF.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:40.580]   And even just as one single page, it's big enough that you can read the entire page nicely.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.740]   If you turn it on its side, it does auto rotate.
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.820]   And now it will have the entire width of a standard size sheet of paper.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.380]   So obviously a comic book is just individual static pages.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:56.580]   But when you're talking about documents like tech reports, I have a from the Cambridge
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.300]   Polymer group, I believe locally.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:04.820]   When you have a document like this that has really complicated formatting, it's absolutely
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.420]   no, it's exactly the way that it was on your screen.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:08.420]   And you can read that.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:10.220]   Can you make it bigger?
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.060]   You can make the text, excuse me, with PDFs, you can zoom in and zoom out, but you don't
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.100]   really need to.
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.420]   This is like 10 12 point text in print.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:21.060]   And you can actually read that text.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:27.100]   But when you turn it on its side, it really is looking at all the good sacks of an eight
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:31.700]   and a half by 11 sheet of paper, because that is the full width of the sheet of paper.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:36.420]   It's especially relevant for Mac users, because again, we have that ability where we can anything
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:42.020]   that we have on our screen, in a window anywhere, we can simply print it straight to a PDF.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:46.580]   So whatever you're looking at right now can be an electronic document with, that's reproduced
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.660]   with absolute faith and absolute fidelity on the Kindle.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:54.980]   I mean, what I've been doing for the past week or two is just keeping it docked to a micro
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.060]   USB cable connected to your host machine.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.900]   And that simply appears as a mass storage device.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.380]   So anytime there's a document that I'm going to need with me when I travel or something,
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.500]   a piece of reference material that I'm going to need.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:11.380]   It's very, very easy to simply print it a PDF and then just simply have that file saved
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.500]   from preview directly onto the Kindle and then it's there.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.220]   And with more than three gigs of user storage, you could conceivably have every document that
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:24.300]   you ever touch, create, read, or have any interest in available to you on this device.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:28.980]   So it could be just that clipboard that contains every piece of information that you ever had
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.740]   any interest in whatsoever.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.500]   And on that basis, again, I had that, unfortunately, it has to go back tomorrow.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.060]   And I was looking, I was thinking about again, that 17 hour flight.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.060]   I was also thinking about all that.
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.460]   Would you take that on a big flight though?
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.860]   I mean, it's kind of large.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.620]   Well, no, not necessarily on a big flag.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:47.100]   And remember that we do have the Kindle app for the iPhone so that if we want to get access
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:52.140]   to that really great 300,000 title commercial book library, we don't even have to take anything
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.140]   with us.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:56.580]   But when you're talking about what I do and what you and I do, where I'm going to be giving
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.500]   lots and lots of, lots and lots of lectures and a lot of it is going to be referring to
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.700]   notes on where I'm going to be going, what things I want to make sure I mentioned, what
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:06.940]   my rundown is going to be normally.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.940]   And normally I do this stuff in advance, but I'm making changes all the way up until the
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.620]   night before as I'm re reviewing.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:16.260]   I need something that I need, I need the ability to print a sheet of paper with special notes
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.620]   that I'm going to need for a certain event or a certain, certain concept.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.300]   This will allow me to have anything that I want available to me.
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.940]   It's especially good given that again, I'm not really going to have internet access with
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:26.940]   me over the week.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.580]   So I can simply load this up with every piece of information that I'm going to need.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:34.260]   It's going to be like having archives of every web page that has information that I'm going
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:39.100]   to need to write the stuff that I'm hoping to write while I'm in the South China Sea.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:46.940]   So on that basis, now obviously Amazon is hoping that newspapers are going to start
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:52.580]   offering these things to subscribers as subsistence rate like they do with cell phones.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:58.060]   Obviously they're hoping to have universities pick them up and so that now instead of,
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:03.500]   it's a very credible thing for students because instead of spending $1,600 bucks a semester
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:09.300]   on books or a year on books, maybe you'll spend $450 on this and maybe $600 or $700
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:13.260]   or $800 on electronic versions of your textbooks where you save a little bit of money but you
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.500]   get to carry this with you wherever you go instead of like a huge big backpack full
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.660]   of textbooks.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.900]   But it's actually, I'm starting to get that little sickness where I'm thinking, you know,
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:28.420]   this could be a very useful thing for me again just as something that will have every document
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:33.580]   that I'm ever interested in or ever might find useful will live on this device.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:38.500]   And fortunately they are back ordered for four to six weeks because as soon as I finished
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.060]   my review, I slept on it for one day then I thought, you know what, I should just order
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.060]   this.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.540]   I'll just forget, I'll just close my eyes and I'll just order it and I'm sure it'll find
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:50.580]   it useful and I'll just buy it and but it's $489 and that's a lot of money.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.100]   But the fact that I would have had it in time for China made me think, okay, well, you know
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:58.100]   what, maybe I'll wait and if I'm back from China and it still sounds like a good idea
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.100]   then maybe I'll go for it.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.940]   Do you have a regular size Kindle?
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.580]   I have a Kindle generation one, the first one that came out so I could also tell myself,
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.700]   well, come on, you need to upgrade your antiquated hardware anyway and at least this way you
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:14.780]   have a good piece of reference hardware for your library that you can then use to educate
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780]   and form the readers.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.100]   Isn't this all about the readers?
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.100]   Do you really talk to yourself like that when you're trying to convince?
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:25.900]   Oh, sometimes it takes the entire committee to get me to buy something really, really cool.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.060]   Oh dear and he's talking funny again.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:32.420]   You're the work we had to do to get ready for China and we don't get to have a, we deserve
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.420]   a talk.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   Come on.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.580]   What happened to you man?
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.580]   You used to be cool.
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.180]   I'm still cool, yeah, you got a haircut.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.820]   Oh, that's nothing to do with that.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.980]   Oh dear, he's losing it.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.140]   He's decompensating folks, will it?
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:48.900]   The sideburns are taking over.
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:49.900]   So you like it.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.620]   He says Steve Gibson, who also bought one and is a fan of the smaller Kindle thought.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:57.020]   It didn't do PDFs as well as he would have liked, but he might have been loading in weird
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.020]   PDFs.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:03.180]   I gave it some pretty challenging things in that, again, I gave it comic books, I got
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:06.620]   all kinds of different tech reports, really complicated formatted stuff.
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:11.060]   I have a bunch of Adobe InDesign documents and of course you can burn, InDesign is essentially
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:13.620]   a native PDF burner.
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.460]   And so I try to find as many complicated documents as I can and it did a great job on them.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:21.700]   Now PDF is the standard for publishing everywhere.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.340]   So you could talk, I mean, literally when all those circulars from the supermarket and
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:30.180]   the furniture stores that landed in your mailbox every single day, it lived at some
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.180]   point as a PDF.
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.740]   And those are some of the most complicated documents you can possibly find.
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:37.060]   I've not been able to get my hands on some super complicated stuff, but suffice to say
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.100]   that anything that I've seen that I've able to get access to, it did a very, very good
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.100]   job on.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.100]   It's not always practical because some of these techs, some of the type is really, really
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.420]   tiny, tiny, tiny, small.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:52.380]   And the best, this device is at its best when you don't need to zoom in and zoom out and
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.100]   magnify in order to make the techs bigger.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:33:00.620]   But again, it's for someone who leads a very document based lifestyle, who needs something
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:05.660]   that's where a $400 or $350 netbook isn't good enough, I need something this small and
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.460]   this light and this convenient.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.380]   It's an interesting purchase.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:14.620]   It's something that you wouldn't think that you'd be thinking of it, but you're actually
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:15.620]   going to start to think of it.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:21.340]   And also, and now, it's of course 10 minutes into the description of it, we get to the
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:22.780]   thing it's supposed to be good at.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:27.260]   It's even better as a book reader, as the original Kindle, or as the original Kindle's.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.260]   Their formatted books are formatted like paperback books.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:35.540]   And this, in the Kindle DX, you have enough screen size that you can actually format the
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.380]   thing like it was a regular hardcover.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.540]   I mean, you have nice, wide areas of text here.
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.660]   So it's more like reading a whole hardcover.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   I like that.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.700]   Their fewer page turns, this fewer stuff like that.
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:53.460]   So again, someone who loves, loves, loves the Kindle already, someone who buys all of
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.980]   his books as electronic ebooks, if he can get his hands on them.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.980]   It's a tempting thing.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:33:59.980]   It's not a ridiculous purchase.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:02.580]   I would love to see it less than 400 bucks and I think it's going to be less, have to
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:07.180]   be less than 300 bucks if Amazon is ever going to achieve their goal of producing the iPod
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.540]   for text.
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.340]   But again, interesting idea.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:14.260]   Just commentary about Jeff Bezos and why the Kindle costs what it does.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.940]   He says, basically, it's what it costs to make it.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.940]   Right.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.340]   And we decided not to subsidize it.
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.340]   I'll find that article.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.500]   I thought it was very interesting business decisions.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.980]   And he clearly thought about it and thought about making it a lot cheaper.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   But he said, yeah, we're going to charge you what it costs to make it crazy thought.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   Crazy notion.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.380]   Well, not people don't always make it up in volume.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.260]   Just a note on the audio boo.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.260]   I just checked.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.460]   You can subscribe.
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.220]   There's a subscribe button next to it.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.740]   It will add it to iTunes and subscribe as a podcast.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:45.380]   So it's instantly a podcast.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.620]   Stephen Fry has an audio boo.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620]   He has a podcast.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.100]   He's posted quite a few of these.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.460]   And it's a 64 K, 22, one sample rate.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.140]   So it's a very that's why it sounds so good.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.140]   But it's also fairly small.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.420]   That's about 10 K per per.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.420]   I don't know.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.420]   Sounds great per second.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.420]   Something like that.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:06.780]   Let me you want to hear Stephen Fry's most recent.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   This is his most recent.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.780]   Oh my God.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780]   Where's my handy?
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:10.780]   I lost my handy.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:11.780]   Where is it?
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:12.780]   That's his fourth band.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.780]   Fugit, I don't know where it is.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:19.100]   Oh, my life is crazy.
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.260]   I had my handy.
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:22.100]   I went to the cafe.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.380]   It was there.
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.860]   I swear to God it was there.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:26.860]   And then it.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:27.860]   Oh, this is so excellent.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:28.860]   It's so schlecht.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.660]   Oh, my laban is.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.660]   Oh my God.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:34.860]   That was on at the time.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   Oh God.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.580]   I'll everywhere I get these pails of milk to market.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:50.100]   I hope these eight the young stable boy is going to come along and help me.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:54.660]   It's no no what you're going to hear these days on the internet.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.260]   Ah, they're me and her.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.860]   All right.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.700]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.700]   Don and Andy.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.540]   We're going to see you in Asia.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.140]   I look forward to seeing you in Beijing done on Saturday actually on the 4th of July.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.140]   Yep.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140]   Looking forward to it.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.140]   Can't wait.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.660]   We might be a little groggy and tired, but we'll be there.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   We'll be there.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.900]   And Andy, I'll see you on the Costa Klasika.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:17.900]   And I will see you.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:22.340]   I don't know what the Chinese word is for love, but the Chinese word for love boat.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:25.060]   I have to often look that up.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.980]   I've forgotten the Chinese word for love.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.180]   Meanwhile, Alex Lindsey, Andy and Akos got born.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:31.060]   I'll be back next week with Mac Break Weekly.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:34.900]   And then I guess Alex, you'll keep the home fires burning for us here in the studios.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:35.900]   I will.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.540]   And I hope you all keep listening.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.180]   We do have lots of shows planned for you.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.180]   We're not going to stop and then watch our feed.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.740]   So Don, where is the best place for people to follow you?
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.420]   That Iweb link is kind of long.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.580]   Is there a shorter link we can.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.020]   Yeah, I've put a diver.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:55.460]   So if they go to screencastonline.com/macmaena09, that will take them to the Iweb page.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.820]   And everything that I do will end up on friend feed.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:01.180]   So if you go to friendfeed.com/liolaport, I'm sure it'll all be there.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:05.100]   And some of it will be on the blog, some of it on Flickr, some of it on audio, boo.
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:09.740]   I might have to lose my handy and see what happens.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.740]   We haven't lost our handy handy not co.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.460]   Thank you very much everybody.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.020]   We will see you next time another Mac Break.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.020]   Time is over.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:18.020]   Go back to work.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.020]   Something like that.
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:29.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:39.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.180]   (upbeat music)
