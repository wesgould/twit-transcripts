[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.320]   And of course we're going to be talking about Apple's big event coming March 8th.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   Still waiting for those invitations. Will Apple call it off?
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   Due to the war in Ukraine. One thing Apple did, might change things in Russia.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.480]   And we'll talk about a way you can turn your heroes into little tiny plastic figurines.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.600]   We'll start with Jim Dower.

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.520]   We have news Leo, I swear, I swear we have news. We have all the news. We have so much news.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.920]   Well, I guess there's really only one question. Has the invitation arrived in?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.440]   No, I think the world is too sensitive to do an invitation right this week. Oh, maybe. Yeah,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.800]   that might be. Oh, hey, I recognize that bustle, proof, undo. Alex Lenzey is in the house. Welcome
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560]   back. We missed you. I forgot I hadn't been introduced yet and I started adding things to it.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.960]   Oh, yeah, you're always welcome to do that. Oh, and there speaking of bustle, proof, undo.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.440]   Is Andy and I go the whole gang is here. Where have you been Alex?
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.160]   I didn't leave anywhere. You know, I do virtual events. So I don't have to go.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.440]   You just visit me. Yeah. Well, no, there was an event. There was an event last Tuesday,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.080]   but I didn't have to go. I was able to manage it from the comfort of my own office, not my own home,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.760]   but my own office. Yeah, you've kind of configured it now this way so that you can
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.360]   Oh, yeah. Have your tentacles, your wire, your fingers wired. See, I want to do the opposite.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.680]   And maybe you can help me. I want to do everything I do on a boat somewhere else in the world.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.160]   In international water, the water is beyond the reach of the authority. No pirates. Don't do it.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.120]   Don't do it pirates. I think that the Starlink is getting close. Yeah, that's why I put it in
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.200]   there or a reservation because they say now it's tied to your residential address. So you can't
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.320]   move it around. But at some point they'll let you do that. And that's yeah, then I can have,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   you know, I get on the cruise ship set up on the balcony, set up my little Starlink.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.120]   Well, and the big thing is getting it to be able to move, which evidently it can move.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.480]   It's just they just don't let you set it up. Well, no, the dishy McDish face doesn't have a motor in it.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.080]   Doesn't it doesn't it move? Yeah, it can error correct it. Evidently it can error correct it
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   at a pretty high speed. I understand. So, so the but it it. But right now I just got one and
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.840]   really needs to see the whole sky. Yes. I thought, oh, I thought this will be great. I just I'll just
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.560]   see this. I have a complete view of the southern sky. Not enough. No, no, it has to be the whole sky.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.680]   Yeah, it has to be the whole sky. In fact, when you're installing it, I know this because I follow the
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.280]   Starlink subreddit. Right. And so I, you know, I've been watching people go through this for a year.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.320]   So when you get it, it actually, when there's obstruction, I'll tell you, let's show you a
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.640]   little picture of the bush. It wants it wants the 360 horizon. So you put it on a big pole or
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.080]   something, right? I'm going to put it on the roof eventually. But right now I actually want to
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.520]   see how far I can take it from my house. We have we have some people in office hours that are
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.000]   taken as much as 10 or 12 miles. So, yeah, like to your address, it's to a region around your address.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.600]   Yeah, but 12 miles. I want to go for it.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.400]   Well, no, but I want to see how far I can do it. And then I'm told and I haven't tested this,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   I'm told that if you just change your address, it's it's more about managing load. They're not
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.240]   trying to keep you in one place. They're just trying to manage the load to the servers. And so,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.640]   they can't handle frankly, they can't handle all the traffic they would be getting if everybody
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   used it. So they're trying to spread it out even. Well, and also if everybody used it,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.120]   and they didn't know where you were, and they were, you know, so the. So anyway, so I, I'm going to
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.200]   take it to Monterey and take it to other places and like, good, let us know. Can I change the address
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   and can I do that stuff? So that's all coming in the next couple of weeks. But they said, as
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.880]   they have said that down the road, unless they get all the satellites up and everything, that
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.440]   the plan is that they would be mobile that you could use it on an RV or carry it with you as you
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.560]   travel. It's definitely being tested right now. There's a variety of organizations in the Ukraine
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   right now. Although, so Elon has sent some Starlink has adjusted it so that it could be used in your
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.960]   Ukraine and he sent a bunch of terminals. Although, opposite people have said,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.760]   you might want to be careful about using those. The Russians are very good at using that kind of
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.360]   satellite data for targeting. So it might put a big target on your back.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.240]   So I mean, you are, they know what you are giving up your information, your location. I mean,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   we've done stuff where we've had sat trucks up that we had to keep them up only for a short
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.920]   period of time because it would only take half an hour to figure out where they were.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.640]   Oh, wow. Where the hell were you then? Was that Kosovo when you were back then in Kosovo?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.720]   Southern Turkey. Oh my gosh. That's another story for another day. Wow.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.160]   When Alex talks about opposite, I just put the muffles over my ears so I can never be sworn to
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.520]   testify. Yeah. Yeah. But Southern Turkey, if you were going to project into a country from Southern
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   Turkey, you put a sat truck at the border there and then, but you wouldn't stay very long.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.960]   Right. Keep moving. Keep moving. Do you think Apple considering the world situation might
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.880]   say let's not do an event, March 8? Oh, yeah. I think that, yeah, because you don't know what
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   the news is going to be on March 7th, that if this gets a lot darker and a lot more hostile,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   then even now they're going to have to cancel anyway. And given that these are probably not
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.480]   things that need to be absolutely announced on March 8th, I wouldn't be surprised if they would
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.880]   simply say, you know what, we'll be at readiness to put this on on five days notice. But let's,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640]   this is this is this this event is just four days old right now of Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.680]   Monday, Tuesday. Yeah. So it's a it's a good thing to just be prudent. Hey, Siri, when is Apple's
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:23.040]   event this spring? What? You can. Did you understand that? Hey, Siri, when is Apple's event this spring?
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.120]   You can't get all the details about Apple events on apple.com. That's not helpful, Siri.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.000]   Hey, Siri, is Apple going to announce a new Mac mini this spring?
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.400]   I'm not sure I understand. She's born a secrecy. If you ask, I'm going to make the Mac mini is
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.280]   dead to me dead to me. I say, let me try this one. This is from nine to five Mac. Hey, Siri,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:57.200]   what is going to be announced at the Apple event? You can't hurry news. No, you'll just have to wait.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.800]   All right. Well, let's let let's let's go for a little balance here.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.880]   Hey, Google, when is the next Apple event?
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:15.680]   Google's thinking. Nope. Nope. It says here's what I'm being. It says Tuesday, March 8th, but not
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:23.280]   it's yeah. It says Tuesday. I shave your eyebrows Google. No, no, just it's a return relevant
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.760]   relevant information for apple. It was that car. Oh, yeah. 2016 Google. I don't suppose I should
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.880]   ask the Samsung Galaxy S 22. Ultra. It just you can ask if it was asked.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.240]   It was a big speed. Big speed. Big speed. Big speed. Go, huh?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.960]   Big speed is just going to ask Google. It's like they have to have just a bunch of Google
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.680]   servers at Samsung and they relay the requests. Isn't that how that works?
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:55.520]   Actually, iOS 15. You heard, by the way, that I am using now I called it at voice number, American
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.880]   voice number three, but it has been revealed that it actually was an African-American black
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.920]   person who recorded those. There's two black voices, one male, one female. It sounded pretty
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.880]   Johnny. I didn't know really what was going on. Now, Apple has gone to the LBGTQ plus community.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.200]   And come up with a voice that doesn't sound like
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:28.240]   any anybody. Less gendered. Less gendered. But yeah, well, let me play it a little bit because it's
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.280]   it sounds. I don't know, but you've probably heard this Renee, but let me I'll play it.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.160]   It's very short. Hi, I'm Siri. Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   Yeah, I guess it's neither male or female. It sounds like it might be Lego loss from the Lord
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:51.280]   of the Rings. It sounds like an elf, maybe. Hi, I'm Siri. Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.360]   That, by the way, is the voice that we have. It's whatever you it's whatever it sounds like to you.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.480]   And that's the voice I would use because I don't think it should sound male or female,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.840]   although I do like the Johnny American voice three. But
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.320]   whenever I send something or tell to do something, it says, okay, it's very it's very happy.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.600]   It's just it's an advancement of the technology. Like they started off like when they
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.840]   Siri was the first really process of its kind. And that was the voice that was available. It
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.040]   wasn't just used for Siri. It defaulted to female in the US and male in the UK because
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.880]   a bunch of sat nav companies or GPS companies had done research way back.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.960]   To see what the majority of people liked back. Yeah, like common stuff. Yeah.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.280]   And now it's yeah. And now it's evolved and you have a choice of voices and also they really
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   wanted to anthropomorphize it at the beginning. I think that's a series on Pixar. Right.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.640]   It was like that was to make it approachable because we feared like not us like not the
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.960]   four of us, but a lot of people fear technology and they fear like robots and Terminator and Matrix.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.000]   And so Apple really wanted to wrap Siri up in like this candy little anthropomorphized Pixar
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.240]   package. And that helped it initially. But as the technology matures as we become
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.480]   more mature as we understand things better, it's kind of satisfying to have a degree of
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.120]   separation because let's face it, like any of these assistants, Google's, Amazon's, they would
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.360]   all be fired if they were actual humans. So like if you give them just a wide plethora of the human
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.240]   experience to draw from, I think it makes them not only appeal to more people, but it feel like
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.840]   more realistic to more people. Yeah. It's these little touches that really put the cherry on the top
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.960]   of a piece of technology. Because you start off with, well, we can only have one voice because really,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.720]   that's the technology that we're limited to. We can't have a, we can't even have two voices.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.680]   That's the limitations that we have. Then we get to levels of sophistication where we're going to
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.600]   have a different palette of voices, Google Assistant doing something that I'm not sure if that was
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.800]   planned or if that was just Google being very academic about things, whereas it's no, we're not
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.440]   going to give our assistant an actual like gendered name. We're just going to call it the Google Assistant
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.560]   and to this day, I just checked just to make sure you have options of like eight or nine different
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.160]   voices, but they're all identified by just a rainbow color. They're not like even given like
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.720]   here is you just you tell us you decide for yourself what this voice sounds like. And I think the next
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.320]   step is when we get sort of like a character creator sort of approach to this sort of thing,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.680]   where now the voice models are so dynamic that you could basically say that every phone,
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.640]   they will create a voice for you that is unique to that phone and to your ear so that to
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   really lock in that personal relationship you have with this device is this isn't one of this,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.680]   this isn't generic voice number three. This is the voice that goes to Andy and not goes iPhone
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.760]   all the way to the point of being able to say auditioning voices and saying yeah,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.960]   literally like generate 20 different voices, allow five of them to go through to the next round.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   And then like when it comes down to the last two or three that you like, say I want that,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.400]   but I want that to be a little bit more Northeastern in tone. I wish that this were a little bit less
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.440]   aggressive but more like hard and this sort of thing. So it's this is the sort of thing that gets
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.360]   people turns people from treating this thing like a gadget and utility to a platform that they
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.520]   rely on to get stuff done that they really don't know what they do without. It's an interesting
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   debate though humanoid or not. You're arguing that it should be more like like their neighbor's voice
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.560]   yeah. I think that I think that you should get the voice that you want and I think that it's going
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.080]   to be it's going to be a very very subtle but importantly forward when if there if if if I if
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.840]   someone does say hey hey Guillermo and four different phones like respond on what the weather is you'll
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.320]   get four different voices because four different people have unique voices on their phones.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   I want more.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.840]   Of accents too.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.080]   Right.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.320]   Reach.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.520]   I go ahead Alex.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.480]   I just want Morgan Freeman.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.080]   I have Samuel L Jackson on my Amazon Echo. That's pretty darn good.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.840]   Morgan Freeman.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:53.920]   We're James.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   Well, Jack.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.800]   We're good.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.840]   Morgan Freeman.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   Morgan.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.080]   The more stately freedom. Yeah.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.080]   That's a good idea. Yeah.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.920]   I don't know if I you know I'm I'm a mixed feelings. I I don't know.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.800]   I haven't lived with a robot voice long enough to know because nobody does a robot voice.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.040]   Everybody wants it to anthropomorphize.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.080]   It feels like it's a bad idea to anthropomorphize technology.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:24.320]   Well, the thing is we have been wired up for human beings as a species for 145,000 years and
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.320]   our software is written to respond to certain cues and certain audio cues and the idea of
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.080]   optimizing a synthetic voice so that it works with the software we have between our ears to
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.880]   understand that, hey, look, what I'm saying this part of the sentence is something that's a
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.400]   little bit preambleage to get your attention, but the actual information is right here or this is
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.800]   not something that I'm just saying. I'm not saying, oh, by the way, there's this other feature you can
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.480]   enable if you want. This is actually a weather alert or this is an appointment that you are about
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   to miss if you don't hit it right now. So that's why we really do need to have that kind of
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:07.840]   sophistication and how well things work. The potential here is that the creepy thing would be
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   if we got to the point where I can, when you've lost a loved one, but you have lots and lots of
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.920]   video of them, samples of their voice, you can have a synthetic voice created to sort of duplicate
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.640]   what your mom's, your cousin's, your brother's voice sounded like and make that like the voice
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:32.560]   of a speaking a system. That's when things get kind of, that's when you get into like the
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.440]   graduate studies class all about this topic where it sounds very, very creepy. I certainly would
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.840]   never want to use something like that because I don't want, I would not want like my memories of
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.880]   my parents' voices to be corrupted by a synthetic version that doesn't quite sound like it. But
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.080]   nonetheless, for other people, if this is what helps them get through the morning process
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.120]   and they use it for nine or 10 or 11 months and then switch to something else,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.360]   more power to them. But this is where we're going in this technology.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.120]   Less creepy than that. I mean, I know a lot of editors now use, I forget the name of the service,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.080]   there's a service where you upload your video and it gives you a transcript, you can edit based
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.760]   on the transcript. Oh, just script. Yeah, just script.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.440]   Yeah. And it can also deep fake voices. So if you didn't say something you needed to,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.080]   you can add in a few words and it'll deep fake your voice for you. And some people just deep fake
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.360]   the entire thing as part of like the previs for their videos or their podcasts. And like,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.680]   you can tell it's not them. If you know it's not them, if you don't know, it's really tough
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.960]   if it's not pointed out to you. Well, and one of the futures of dubbing for movies is actually
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.720]   using deep fakes to have the folks impersonate that person and then have the the AI just tighten
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.440]   it all the way up so that it sounds like Tom Cruise speaking in, you know, French or whatever,
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   doesn't know spoilers, but that anymore. ILM did that in a recent episode of something and it did not,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.800]   it did not sound, it did not sound good. It was very very, very gunkanny valley.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   Yeah, it's it's well, and ILM is still, they're not using the deep fake technology that I don't
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.960]   think they did for this. They pulled in all these stuff from the 1970s and they pushed it all through
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.280]   a machine learning model. And then they had that do the dialogue because the actors way over now.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.880]   And it was all like like ebooks that they'd read and like speeches they'd given and other movies.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.680]   And so it was the younger voice, but it had no act like not the right level of intonation for
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   anything. So it sounded almost like it was crushed the entire way through. All right,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.040]   interesting though. Anyway, even you know who doesn't know when apples events are gonna be.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:42.240]   Whatever kind of voice it uses. I'm Tim knows. I'm really thinking it's a mistake to answer
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.400]   primorphize technology that it leads us down a dangerous path and that we should really.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   I do. Yeah, we should continue to understand that these are machines. You're talking about
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.080]   in Dune the. The Butlerian, Jad and then they'll make no machines. Oh, that's right. That's right.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.960]   That's kind of a backstory in Dune is the war against the machines. That seems to be very common
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.920]   trope in science fiction. Well, that's a warning shots Leo. One day we get killed by the machines,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.040]   we go to the Pearly Gates and they go, we sent you Terminator. We sent you the
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.640]   meeting. We sent you Dune. What are you doing here? Yeah, we told you.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:23.840]   I just feel like it would be good. I know it's our biology doesn't know about machines,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.400]   but we have them now. I do think that there's often a risk. We talk about this a lot around
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   social media in the sense that we have things that we're told like we think in our frontal lobe
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.720]   that is true and our lower brain goes, that's not true. Like for instance,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.440]   we think that social media is giving us a community like we talk about communities a lot.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.480]   Yeah, social media is giving you, but it's not. And so when the front says,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.400]   this should be a community and the back says, this is not a community. This doesn't give me the
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.000]   fulfillment that I need. The gap between those two is depression. And so because our brain is
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.280]   pulling in two different directions, our front is working to make something true.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.640]   And our back, our lower brain is going, this isn't what I, this is what I came for. And I think that
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.920]   to your point that when we make things close, but not all the way there, you end up with the
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.960]   situation where your brain is kind of, it actually creates some cognitive load of your brain constantly
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.240]   saying that's not, I know it's not real, but I'm going to treat it as real.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   I'm even more concerned. I mean, look at the bots on Twitter, for instance, the disinformation bots.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.440]   Because we don't distinguish them from actual humans, we treat them like humans. We give them
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.080]   more credence than they deserve. So I'm not even concerned about the cognitive load of this.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.280]   I'm concerned about kind of misunderstanding the universe because we're not making that distinction.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.200]   Well, Georgia explained it really well too. She said that like the uncanny valley originated because
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.320]   back in ye old days of human evolution, eld, people would get sick or hell. Like the
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.560]   originally like the zombie movement or insectoid movement, because it looks unnatural and healthy.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.680]   And it's a warning sign that something is very wrong with that. You ate something bad.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.000]   Stay away from that. That's why those Boston dynamic robots send like the chill of
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   destinies through a meal when you see them walking. Because nothing in nature should walk that way.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.840]   So immediately every alarm bell goes off. Well, it's a way, you know, I mean, no one knows,
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.960]   but the evolutionary scientists think it's a way of avoiding illness and bad food. So if
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.720]   somebody's diseased, often that makes their behavior abnormal. And to protect, you know,
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.960]   evolutionarily speaking, you want to kind of avoid catching that disease, you want to avoid them.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.120]   And then if you ate something bad, actually, Georgia was talking about this on the Twitter on Sunday.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:36.560]   I completely think that this is the problem with VR in general, the distance between
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:43.200]   the focus distance and the conversion distance. If they don't match, then your brain says,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800]   yeah, that's wrong. You probably ate something bad. You should vomit it out now.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.200]   Now, while we don't know for sure, that's what it is, but I think that's the case.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.640]   And I think that that's interier in sight is a super important thing to keep
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.960]   aligned. You know, like we think about that all the time with VR or even really large movie
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.560]   screens like iMacs or something like that, if too much is moving and you don't have a
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.520]   point of reference outside of it. You just play too many video games, even with that, even if
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.760]   if you're not wearing a headset, because your brain says you're not moving, your eyes see movement,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.320]   but your inner ear says, but you're not moving. And that distance, the distance between them is
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.960]   more than cognitive load. It's a sign something's wrong.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.720]   It's even though when the architects came and made us build the pyramids and stuff,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.960]   we remember them. There's like some human history of our alien overlords, and now we don't want
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.320]   them back. So we resist anything that's like them. I really wish that whole architect thing
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.360]   were true. I would really like that to be true. I guess we'll never know, or maybe we will.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.520]   Maybe we'll find an artifact out there, and the aliens will come back to Earth.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.320]   So I just bought a bunch of accessories to go with my new Mac Mini.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.720]   Well, they're not going to go away. I mean, they don't have an expiration.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.240]   What did you get? Well, a lot of stuff.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.120]   Well, because I already have the 55 inch monitor, I've still undecided on the KVM. So I did
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.200]   fortunately get a KVM, but I thought, you know, sometimes that giant monitor is too much. So I got
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.480]   this Dell portable 14 inch monitor that I could put to the side. So I could have the Mac on that,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   and then the Linux box on the big monitor or swap them. And then of course, I had to get a dock.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:42.560]   So CalDigit has a new Thunderbolt 4 dock. It's back ordered. So I guess I,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.640]   I guess it's probably good that I'm not getting a new Mac Mini this next week.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.400]   But that looks really good. The TS4, we were talking about that last week, I think, with Doc Rock.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.920]   And so that I so need more Mac Minis. And I'm just like dying to not, not I know. I'm like,
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:06.240]   I know, I'm like, Oh, no, no, I can't do that yet. I know. So this is the TS4.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.280]   It's really as much for a laptop as anything.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.080]   I just and then, you know, the one that's really nice also is the one that's the
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.520]   OWC that's the same size as the Mac Mini. It sits right underneath. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll get that.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.720]   And then actually this was going to be my, my pick of the week, but I'll give it, I'll give it to you
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:36.160]   now. This is for the laptop because Lisa also, so I told Lisa, where is it? It's the, oh, is this one,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:45.520]   the 18 port hyper drive dock thing that you put your laptop on? They just started shipping that.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   Lisa wants to, she, it's in her mind to, she has an old iMac. And at first she was going to use her M1
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.840]   laptop, the old 13 inch. And then I realized, Oh, I can't do two monitors on that. She wants a
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.160]   lot of monitors. She has a 49 inch monitor. And she wants to replace the iMac monitor with another
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.760]   one. So I did go out and get a monitor for that. And then I realized, I, oh, I can't really very
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.320]   easily, I don't want to put a driver on there to drive, but the, the new hyper drive dock,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.760]   she could put her laptop on that and drive two monitors with that additional software.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.640]   Anyway, I, and then I said, Oh, you know what, let's just get you a Mac Mini.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:32.800]   So I don't know. They're amazing little, little little machines. I just, I think we're really,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.120]   yeah, I'm just really, and they went from being, again, they just went, that's why I'm so
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.960]   interested in waiting to see what happens next. But is that they went from these like little pieces
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.640]   of glue to actual work, working machines that we can actually use with the M1. And so you're just
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.440]   really, I'm really excited to see the next one, because you know, a lot of us, I mean, I don't know,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.160]   a lot of us, I have a lot of monitors. And so a laptop just gets in the way. And so it's great
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.600]   to have these little computers off in the side that do the things. Yeah. And then, and it also is
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.280]   nice for me, because I have a PC, and a Mac, and I want to have both. And anyway, anyway,
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:13.040]   I guess I can wait. It's hard. So you think I'm really, now I'm really mad at Putin. You think
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.320]   now that's a bridge too far that Apple's putting off their event because of this
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.200]   invasion of you. Well, I mean, it's not always a week before back when they were physical, it was
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.960]   more than a week and last year it was between six and seven days. So it could be the
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.520]   tomorrow doing a March 8th, and they just haven't, I mean, they don't have to give us a week heads
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.680]   up. They could tell us on Monday, they could send out a push notification the same day. Yeah.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.280]   Hey, come on over either. We're dropping some hot new merch today, kids hot new merch. What?
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:48.640]   All the stuff that has been shot and edited by that by now. I mean, close to by now. But yeah,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.560]   it would be not not, you know, it's going to be like buying shoes or buying concert tickets,
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.280]   like oops, or graphics cards, like sorry, fonts already snapped up every single Mac mini.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.840]   Please don't do that to me. Please don't do that to me. All right, let's take a little break. We do
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:12.880]   have other news to talk about, including, of course, Apple's response to the Ukrainian invasion.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.240]   Talk about that just a little bit.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.360]   Ah, what a world we live in, huh? What a world.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.040]   Okay. Deep breath center. Our show today brought to you by wealth front.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.560]   You know, when the world events are like this and shaky, you kind of go,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:39.200]   and if you're, if you're doing the, you know, diamond hand stocks thing, okay, more power to you.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.040]   But even on billions last week, they said, oh, day traders never make any money.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:52.880]   There is a way to build wealth. And I love this idea. You know, it's these days, you know,

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.360]   do doesn't mean you know what you're doing or your social network knows what it's doing or somebody

[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.680]   portfolio, which will balance if you want to play a little bit, your other riskier bets.

[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:56.000]   know you saw it here. Wealthfront.com/macbreak. Check it out. Check it out. Yo, to yourself to do that.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:09.440]   Let's see here. Let's see. Right now, you can't use the App Store or the Google Store for things
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.600]   in Russia like paying for the subway. In fact, there's these huge lines now in the subway in Moscow
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:24.400]   because you can't use your iPhone to pay because of the banks being sanctioned. I think in many
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.480]   ways, Apple Pay no longer works. Should, you know, Russian Minister, Vice Prime Minister
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:37.040]   Michaela Fedorov said Apple should just stop selling iPhones, stop providing any services of any
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   kind of Russian users. I appeal to you, he tweeted, "Stop supplying Apple services and products to
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   the Russian Federation, including blocking access to the App Store." That's probably not a great idea.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:56.320]   As tempting as it is to additionally put the heat on the Russian government,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.640]   the last time I looked into this, human rights organizations for saying that the thing is, if
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:09.040]   instance like this, if Apple were to shut down access to the App Store, access to all their products,
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.760]   you're also shutting down a communications tool that citizens will be using to shoot video,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.360]   report on what's going on, communicate with each other, communicate with loved ones,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.680]   and that's possibly going to do more harm than good a lot. But there are things that they could
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:32.320]   be doing. I know that the Google Play Store removed access to the Russian State News
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   site app, RT, off the... It's no longer available to users in the Play Store in the Ukraine,
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.160]   but that came at a direct request from the government. And that was essentially the Google
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.760]   Play Store complying with a legal request to pull down an app. So I don't know if Apple has done
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.920]   the same in the Russian App Store, but a lot of the stuff is not so much bravery, so much as we
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   have agreed to abide by laws and legal demands and legal demands we are abiding by.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:07.680]   I think that Apple may want to get on the right side of this one. I think that they're shutting
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.840]   down the stores, the physical stores, or anything that are not shipping any more stuff to
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.560]   them. I mean, I think that shutting down iCloud or services, I think, would probably be more,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.960]   again, as Andy said, probably impact individuals more, but I think maybe even shutting down the
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:31.840]   App Store for now, taking the Russian apps off the platform, I think would probably be useful.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   I think that there's not... From Apple's perspective, if unless Putin disappears,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.640]   like goes six feet under in the next month, which is a growing possibility, there's not going to be
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:50.000]   an economy there for years. It's going to be complete devastation for that economy,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.960]   and it's not going to come back anytime soon. So there's not a lot to lose from a financial
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.520]   perspective. There's just an opportunity to stand with the right side of this one.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.880]   Wave of sight. Yeah.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.320]   Because the Russians are totally screwed. Like it is, the Russian government is completely
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.080]   screwed. And the only way out is to get rid of Putin. And it's just a question of whether they're
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.200]   going to do that or not. Yeah. And it's unfortunate that normal Russians have to suffer, but
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.800]   that's... They do have a government that's killing a lot of people somewhere else.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.000]   Yeah. So we can feel bad about the Russians, but the Ukrainians are getting bombed.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.840]   Right. And so the thing is that at some point, somebody there has to do something decisive,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.040]   because this is getting out of hand. And it's not going to get better. It's going to get worse.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.240]   They're starting to increase. They haven't even used any of their real power yet.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   And so if they... We have everybody needs to...
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.800]   We're always trying to keep them from doing that.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.760]   It's this way, right?
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.080]   So it's super important that everybody does absolutely everything financially. I mean,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.800]   we should be stopping all gas, all oil, everything should be stopping right now,
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.280]   because it could get a lot worse than it is right now. And Apple... I don't think Apple, again,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.360]   has much to lose, because there's not going to be anything left of the economy
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.400]   if they go much further down the path. The rubles of penny.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.760]   Oh, you did see some countries saying, "No, no, no. We don't want to stop the sale of luxury goods.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.720]   We still need to sell luxury goods." You know, honestly, put the squeeze to the
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.760]   oligarchs seems to me the short... Their yachts are running, right?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.200]   Like the people are hunting down their yachts right now.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.800]   Yeah, get the yachts. Yeah, because that's the shortest way to squeeze Putin, you know.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.240]   It seems to me... Well, and again, we have to remember that we're also...
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   Companies are going to have to stay in this social world and everything else.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.000]   Companies are going to have to start looking at how they look and where they are.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.720]   And I think that this is a preview to Taiwan.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.480]   No, that's the thing. You think China's worried that they'll set a precedent because what they
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.400]   really don't... They could afford to cut off Russia, but can they afford to cut off China?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.840]   Well, I think American companies need to start really thinking about diversifying from China,
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.800]   because Taiwan will be another country like Ukraine, where China is going to try to take it over.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.040]   China is watching carefully. I agree.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.520]   And it will be very unpalatable to keep on running your factories in China if it's attacking Taiwan.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.640]   And so I think this is a warning shot to all American companies that they need to start
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.960]   figuring out how to get out of China. It takes time, doesn't it? I mean, I think Apple has been
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.320]   thinking about it. They really wanted to diversify their manufacturing.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.400]   Yeah. India, Vietnam, a lot of other countries have
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.320]   since an opportunity and are making very good offers to a lot of different companies.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.120]   Apple, however, is the crown jewel that if you get a contract for mass
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.000]   if you get a contract for World Drug Manufacturing for Apple, you are going to get so much other
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.640]   business that it's going to jeopardize your ability to even fulfill your Apple contract.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:46.720]   So they might be late to the game there, but it's hard to know where to draw the line
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:54.320]   in a lot of these circumstances. I mean, I'm very, very surprised at how quickly the temperature
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.360]   the room changed and how quickly everybody, a lot of people who are operating on a national,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   international level had to read the room and respond accordingly when we have other military
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.160]   incursions, other military actions, other mass slaughters that have gone, oh, well,
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.120]   geez, that's an interesting statistic been moving right along. So why do you think that is? Is it
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.200]   because Ukraine is kind of a European nation? We can kind of identify with them.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   It's because I don't think anyone thinks that Russia is this is the first thing that Russia's
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.640]   going to this isn't this is not the last thing Russians going to do. I think that's what everyone's
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.560]   worried about. There is a real nasty streak of these are our white civilized Europeans that a
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.320]   lot of the country is a lot of the presidents all the news coverage. Like it's it's it's terrible
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   invasion, but people are using as an opportunity to commit a supremacy at the same time, which
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.600]   is hugely distasteful. Yeah, no, I agree. There and there is, of course, the threat of nuclear
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.320]   war, which is hanging over our heads now, thanks to Putin. Just, you know,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.000]   anyway, we're not here to we don't this is beyond my pay grade to talk about exactly this. But I
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.560]   think it is something Apple is probably discussing a lot right now and internally.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:12.880]   Yeah, it's just goes to show politically or non politically, they put so much of their success
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.400]   in one country doesn't matter like what the political situation is in that one country.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.600]   It was it was an interesting thing to see that Apple really didn't seem to have a plan. Excuse
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.480]   me that they weren't showing up demonstrating a plan B for what happens if everything goes south.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:35.120]   And we've already seen the difference between China in 2009 and China in 2012 was already night
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.880]   and day. There was there was a there was a blessed period up until the current president came in
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.120]   that said the well, where this is this is going to this is this is a relationship that's going to
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.640]   continue to blossom continue to be beneficial continue to work out really, really great.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.480]   It seems as though everybody has had 10 years of notice that says that this this could go very,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.000]   very bad very, very quickly. And if we're relying on one provider of these services,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.840]   we could wind up in a very, very touchy situation. Russian authorities last week
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:15.120]   warned Google, meta, Apple, Twitter, TikTok and others that they had until the end of
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:24.720]   the month, which I guess is over now to the end of February, I guess, to set up legal entities in
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.440]   the country. This, you know, this is the this is the authoritarian move. Well, you have to have
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.040]   offices here. So we have somebody we can throw in the well, I think the timing of that was probably
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.920]   not not accidental. I don't think anybody's interested in making any more of this point.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.200]   At this point, Russia, at this point, yeah, the landing law makes the companies and their
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.280]   employees more vulnerable to Russia's legal system and the demands of government sensors,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:53.360]   legal experts and civil society. Like the problem with this stuff is that it like there's so much
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.960]   nuanced to unpack here. And for example, data repatriation and making localized versions of
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.360]   companies, like we see the extremes of those in Russia and China, but a lot of European countries
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.760]   want that too. They either don't trust US servers. They don't like US laws because they have a very
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.120]   different idea of what government should or shouldn't be responsible for. Like France and
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.160]   Microsoft have been arguing about data repatriation for a long time already. And it's it's a big problem.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.360]   Like it's it's something that a lot of countries feel like they don't have control over their own
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.560]   citizens data. And that's not an unreasonable thing, but it's often fronted by unreasonable
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.760]   activity in Russia and China. And at the same time, Apple has this policy of relentless engagement.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.360]   Like they believe they can't change something if not involved in it. But at what point does that
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.200]   become support? Like what they and Andy and I have talked about this for a long time. We've all
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.080]   talked about this for a long time. It's an incredibly fine line that you have to thread those those
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.480]   needles. And we've seen Tim Cook do that in China for years. I don't have the same knowledge of what
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.440]   Apple's been doing in Russia for years. But as we become an internet, we were this big international
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.240]   internet. And now it feels like it's being broken back down into national laws, national borders,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:01.360]   very different and opposing laws often in the EU and the US. And it's it's going to be incredibly
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.000]   complicated. And I think it's going to be worse when it's in in in Europe, because there's no like,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.960]   Oh, that's Russia. That's China. It's like, no, Italy wants to or Holland wants to put Apple in
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.320]   jail because of dating apps. And it's going to be a much bigger conversation.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   You remember the last in January, Russian authorities threatened arrest Apple and Google employees,
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.960]   unless they removed an app, the Navalny app, the opposition leader app, he's in prison right now.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:36.160]   I think Apple complied. Apple says they have in fact complied with the landing law. This was
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:45.200]   before the invasion. Google has sort of complied. Let me see, there's a list of the New York Times
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.240]   of who has who is one guy, you know, in a rent share apartment. And boy, is he going to be a
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.000]   well poor guy. That's not a job. He really want is it? I know. Apple TikTok and Spotify have
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.280]   complied according to Roscomb, Nods or their their internet regulator. Google has taken steps.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.600]   Twitch, a telegram have not met a and Twitter have complied with some parts of the law,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   but not others. So, meanwhile, they're getting pressure from the US Congress. Senator
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.960]   Warman, Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Russia to a meta
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.160]   Reddit telegram and others urging them not to let Russian entities use their platforms
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.280]   to sow confusion about the war. So they're facing it from both sides. Isn't it amazing how like the
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.760]   meat like like you like the Ukraine Twitter account is fighting a war, an ingenious war of memes
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.840]   at the same time. Well, this is against the disinfo warfare has changed entirely, right? Yeah.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:53.920]   And even in 20 years, and the tech companies have a huge role in this, you know, Google Maps was
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:02.880]   being used to plot Russian troop movements. You know, there is absolutely a disinformation
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.760]   battleground or an information battleground going both ways on these social platforms like
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.280]   TikTok and Twitter and Facebook. It's just fascinating. It's it's very a lot of change could
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.720]   change everyone's perceptions. Like that was one of the earlier concerns about TikTok. The
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.640]   algorithm is so good. And it wasn't under US control that if anybody wanted to suddenly
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.440]   change perception of Hong Kong or Taiwan, it's it's a very small algorithm machine learning model
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.040]   change. Right. Yeah. I go ahead. Sorry. All I was going to say is that, you know, a war like
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   World War II couldn't have happened, you know, with social media because, you know, the things
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.200]   that happened there and the number of civilian casualties would have been something that people
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.920]   couldn't handle, you know, and that may be one of the reasons that we're seeing such
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   opposition, right? Is we're seeing it. I mean, that was, I don't remember.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.160]   Yeah. That was the first TV war. And that really did stimulate a lot of resistance to Vietnam
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.960]   in the United States because we were seeing the boys being. I mean, we were having counts. I mean,
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.120]   and it's horrible that we're having counts, but I think that it's a it's progress that we are
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.320]   upset about 500 or 300 or, you know, people dying or 10 people dying on a missile attack,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   you know, 50 years or 70 years or whatever, we killed 100,000 people in a day. Yeah. You know,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.680]   and that was that was somehow okay. And I think that it is important to look at the fact that
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.440]   that we're more connected and more makes us more human. Hey, this isn't this isn't.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.480]   Yeah. Yeah. That isn't that the smaller numbers make a difference. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.640]   Yeah. We all know. We have listeners in both Ukraine and Russia. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.120]   Some of the some of those powerful imagery that comes out of these conflicts is when you see
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:45.360]   mass protests in Russia calling Putin a jerk. In a country in a country where that has life
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.200]   altering consequences, it makes it makes it difficult for a populist to be manipulated into
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:58.400]   thinking that Russia is a mass organism focused towards fighting NATO and claiming territory that
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.520]   they think that they have rights to even though they historically have not had rights to this thing.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:10.720]   So when you see that when you see that any regime is fragile, it will basically move people's emotions
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.200]   in hopefully in the right direction. Unfortunately, it also moves those leaderships in a very poor
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.360]   direction when they see how how close they can come when you when you draw online in the sand and
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.000]   say the only way that I'm leaving this presidency is feet first, you get enough people together to
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.840]   say we'll take you up on that offer and that leads that person to do some very, very strange and
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.400]   awful things.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:38.160]   Okay, let's change the subject. Jim Dauhrimple retiring. This is a huge story everywhere.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:46.880]   The our great friend, the man with the beard, who have for how long Jim was at
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:53.280]   he was at Max Central in 94, he says. I am sure he covered the Apple one launch. I'm
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   positive in some way he covered the Apple one. He started he started his own publication The
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:08.640]   Loop in 2009. So he was one of the early guys doing it independently. Yeah, so I the loop I guess
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:15.200]   continues. He says, after 30 years of reporting on Apple, I am retiring. One of the stimulating
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.360]   factors, he's getting married. Congratulations, Jim. Yeah. His fiancee Erica has accepted a job
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.200]   in Austin. And so they bought a house on five acres of land outside of Austin. She's wonderful.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.400]   She's so good. Do you know Erica? Good. Yeah, she's magnificent. Yeah. He says, I'm looking forward
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.640]   to taking more time to play guitar. Haven't played much in the past couple of years. I'm going to
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.080]   fix that very soon. I will serenade the wildlife on my land with some Aussie songs.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:50.320]   So they're getting married and make. Congratulations, Jim. It sounds like he's going to continue to do
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:59.200]   the Dow Rimple report podcast with Dave Mark. I don't know. Does the he says, if you currently pay
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.360]   for the loop, you could continue that to help support the podcast. He's going to be up to the
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.800]   loop. It's over. He's going to keep it. Yeah. The one thing I'm not sure about is when he moved
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.120]   from Canada to California, Heineken, Canada almost went out of business. I think Heineken,
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.600]   US doubled its sales. But I don't know if they're prepared for like the West Coast Heineken branch
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.960]   to almost close and suddenly have like twice the capacity in Texas for him. Yeah. I wonder how
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:27.200]   good his poor is and have you been to the Heineken experience in Amsterdam? No, no, they have a whole
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.440]   port and they give you a hope. There's a whole pouring. It's very important that you pull just
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.480]   right. I think Jim just walks around with the keg like in one hand and extra and he just like
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.600]   holds the keg. Anyway, we wish you the best, Jim. You're just great. Well, you know, since you're
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.560]   going to continue podcasting, we'll definitely get Jim on the show more often. And he's cooking
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.520]   now. He said we can get him right in the kitchen pasta and sauces. Yeah. You should have him on
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.160]   your on your weekend cooking office. I know we should. We should show something. I want to know
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.960]   how Jim's how he makes his sauces. I'll show you how to make Tim Hortons. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:09.280]   So what a legend. What an icon. Yeah. Kind of a, you know, I think I admire him.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.520]   Retiring is a hard thing to do. It's a scary thing to do.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:20.720]   I just I just imagine it being like the opening scenes and unforgiven,
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:27.200]   where you met a good woman. I like that. I like that no more. Yeah. But all these people are
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:34.560]   talking this crap. I like that. Your mother got blessed or so. Put me on the right street.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.360]   I love it. Like old man Logan, Andy. He's going to go blow away a saloon at some point.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.720]   Wow. I never even thought of that. Yeah. We'll see. They said they wrote that the iPhone is a
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.880]   dead end technology that doesn't innovate. They put up a billboard.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.360]   Grabbed the hide and get bought. When his work was done, he rode back from once he had come and he
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.600]   was Jim. And he didn't preserve that. Prosper it and stuff. Good. We love you, Jim. You know,
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.040]   congratulations. Congratulations on getting married. Make it more time for yourself. I think
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.640]   you're doing the right thing. I think that's great. Come back and visit because we will miss you.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:18.000]   It's hard. I think all of us will will test to the fact that, you know, basically writing every day
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.160]   for the loop must is a hardship. It's a burden. It's like one of the hard things.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:29.920]   They have to make a video every day. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Jimmy should have just done what I did,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:35.520]   which is hire a bunch of people. And then let them do the work. And then I just sit here now.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.480]   In my chair for a while. He had like three, three, four writers, I think, on the loop for a while.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.400]   And then, yeah. Yeah. And also, it's like it is still a hamster wheel because you've got to make
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.520]   sure everything is running and all of a sudden. Yeah. You just actually, what it does is it just
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:57.760]   changes your job to something else entirely. I have signed up and downloaded it, but it's not
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:04.320]   working yet on my Mac, but it will, I'm sure Amazon's Luna streaming gaming service is now launched
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:14.720]   in the US. The idea, much like Microsoft's X cloud and Guy Kai and the NVIDIA GeForce now and all
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:23.280]   of these services, the idea was, I guess Google's Stadia as well. Let the games run on our servers,
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:28.560]   and you can play them on anything. Luna will play on Android, iOS, Chrome OS, Mac OS,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:36.880]   and Windows. The Luna Plus service has 100 plus games, 10 bucks a month. There's a kid friendly
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   family channel for six bucks. If you like Ubisoft, there's an Ubisoft Plus channel for
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:49.680]   a whopping $18 a month. But if you're an Amazon Prime member, there are some free games you can
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:56.080]   play right now. Play free with Prime. There's what they say, a rotating selection of games
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.200]   on the Prime Gaming channel. Then probably games nobody will want to play.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:09.920]   If you sign up right now for Luna Plus, you can get a founder pricing. They save for life of
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:17.200]   six bucks a month. It's not free with Prime, that's interesting. Well, there is some free with Prime,
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.880]   but not much. It's these rotating. Let me see what the games are. You can play them kind of.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.320]   Prime just went up by its head, its first big price hike. You can play in the browser,
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.920]   but it has to be Chrome or Safari.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:40.480]   It's going to be another way to sell Fire TV and Fire tablets, by the way. I'm sure that's part of
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:50.080]   all this. I keep trying to figure out exactly who's... I haven't seen consumer stats on this,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.040]   on who really is going in on this. Because it seems as though you're looking at it,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:03.360]   you're looking at an intersection between someone like me who enjoys top tier titles at a distance,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.000]   but is not willing to spend five or six hundred dollars on a console if you can get them from
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.920]   scalpers or a couple thousand dollars on a gaming PC. But it seems as though a lot of the people
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.640]   who are going to appreciate those really in-depth games are going to be the ones who are excited
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.320]   about getting the new Xbox, excited about getting the new PlayStation. And give a lot
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.240]   of these people that are like, "How many?" They're actually putting sensors on the screen to figure
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:30.800]   out what is the latency between when I pull this trigger and when I see something go boom on the
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.440]   screen. And those are the people that are absolutely going to savage streaming platforms.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:41.280]   It's like Apple Arcade is a great idea because it really goes towards the soft spot, the soft
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.720]   underbelly of gaming people who are easy to please, who have low demands, and they just want to see
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.200]   lots and lots of churn. They'll be into a game for a couple of weeks and then be on to the next one.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:58.560]   Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, Google basically has, I think, abandoned Stadia.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.720]   Yeah. Well, they Google the ball. They Google it. Yeah.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.800]   It's like, I'm sorry that Google is a verb that they've earned completely through their own efforts,
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:18.160]   one on making a masterful search engine, and also figuring out how to come up with a big splashy
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.760]   product and then say, "Yeah, not so much about a year later." Yeah. Yeah. And I think that the hard
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.400]   part there for Google specifically is that it's just so hard to get people to now jump on because
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.920]   you just don't know how long it's going to last. You know, there's a part of it that you have to
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.280]   stick with it, even if it's not working, you have to stick with it a bit longer because,
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.960]   you know, it used to be that, you know, people would jump on to stuff that Google was doing.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.640]   Then you had to do it, you had to prove that you're going to do it for a certain period of time.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.200]   But so many people have lost their shirts trying to like take advantage of a new Google product
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.280]   that I think is just really hard to get early adopters and then get any adopters. So that's the real
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:57.040]   problem. Even with things they're supposed to be good at, like cloud-based messaging, it's like,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.680]   "God, if you can screw that, how many times do they screw that up in the room?" The things that
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.040]   Google has something, I mean, Google has a handful of things that pay for everything else,
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:11.680]   all the goofy stuff like YouTube and ads. Search ads, really. I mean, like, they can't lose with
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:20.160]   search ads, so they can afford to do a lot of dumb things. Yeah. But I don't know. I mean,
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.240]   they're asking for their ads. They're faceful of their ads because like they just don't ship.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.480]   Like they, again, they hired like the second guy in charge of Android and one of the best
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.440]   designers ever at Apple to make a phone, never ship the phone. They did it again within the second
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.600]   phone project, never shipped it. They just canceled their meta OS. Like they get to like,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.320]   they're like Google, but they learn how to cancel faster, I think. Yeah. I think that you want to,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.000]   Apple, Apple cancel stuff and no one even knows it existed. Like it didn't, you know, like it was,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.720]   I've talked to people that no longer work at Apple that have said, and they won't even tell me
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.920]   what the products were, but they were like, there were products in there that I would have bought,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.040]   I would have paid three times what we were planning to charge for it. And it would have been amazing
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.720]   and he goes, and then we canceled it because there wasn't, for whatever reason, it wasn't going to
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:06.480]   turn the corner. So like this. So to spread the malice around, Apple is like that frustrating
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.440]   chess player that like, I always keeps their finger on the piece of it. I haven't gone yet.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.160]   Wait a minute. Okay. I'm pulling this piece back. No, I think that's Facebook. I think Apple's the
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.520]   one who stares for so long you want to get up and smack them. They just stare and they don't
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.040]   touch the piece. Facebook has their finger on the piece and they're moving around and Google is just
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.080]   like, Oh, no, that no. And then it's really stable.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:34.880]   So the reason I mentioned this, I mean, I know it's an Apple podcast is because, you know, one of the
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:40.320]   wraps against Macintosh all this time has been, oh, it's a bad gaming platform, but increasingly,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:48.480]   you don't really need to have a gaming platform. You can just play in the browser.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.200]   So the nerds want the platform. The nerds want they want to play Elden Ring on the metal.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.000]   If you're well, I admit, and I don't, I don't like using windows. I have only one machine that
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.480]   plays windows, but that's where I had to install Elden Ring 60 gigabytes later.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:08.880]   Says every Mac nerd ever. Yeah. That's best. Yeah. Yeah, which too bad, but I guess it's, I don't know.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:15.440]   I mean, I get I'm playing now in this is in the in a Chromium browser. I am playing
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:23.760]   one of the free to play games. This is called fogs. I guess I'm a wiener dog.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:31.280]   I don't know what's going on. Oh, yeah, there's my I've got Oh, Jesus is almost filthy.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   That's going on here. I was like a snake game kind of, I guess. Is this a new Pokemon they just
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.040]   announced Leo? I'm very confused right now. I feel like it. I don't know. Oh, something's
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.520]   happening. This is a swoohian region. Yeah. I mean, the reality is though, is that, you know,
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.680]   casually, if you look at like mobile gaming now is, I think it's something like almost 60% of the
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:00.000]   market, you know, like it's console or so Apple, it's five bucks a month, right? So this is six
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.640]   bucks a month if you sign up right away. So you could, I mean, this I'm playing this on Linux,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:13.200]   which is, you know, not normally considered a well, this is probably about how all I'm going to be
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:18.800]   able to play. I guess I have to figure out how to wake this guy up. I don't know. You have to use
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.360]   Chromium for this, Leo? Yeah, I had installed Chromium on Linux and then it said, Oh, I don't
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.880]   know. Yeah. Okay, you can play it, but we won't be happy that like when they look when they first
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.920]   forked WebKit, they had to say WebKit like Gecko for support. And now nobody wants to support
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.480]   Gecko anymore. Like you basically had to use it as a compatibility layer. And now like nobody
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:44.000]   wants to support it. It's all Chrome now. So this is playing fine. The frame rate's fine. I'm on a
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.280]   very, very fast network at home. I tried to play at there is a DMG file you can download,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.560]   which is probably just a browser window for Mac OS. But it was complaining about my internet,
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.000]   even though I have plenty of internet. So all right, I'm going to exit out of this. There is a
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.640]   Amazon controller. You may or may not want to buy it says you can play all of these games in the
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   keyboard. You could see I wasn't having much success doing that. Are you sure you want to
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:18.000]   quit fogs? Yes. I am sure I want to quit fogs. I can't even figure it out. I need a kid to help
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.760]   me with that game, I think. So anyway, it's out just a, you know, everybody's doing it now. All the
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.960]   kids are all the cool kids are doing it. I think you're right, Andy. I think really the
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.560]   market Apple cares about and has and owns his casual gaming. And they're fine with that.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.960]   Yeah, as long as they're open with third parties, as long as they make their platform
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:45.680]   available to streaming, that's fine. I think they're always there. What they love to do is not to take,
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:52.400]   not to not to necessarily be the most popular platform, but to be the most popular platform
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:57.280]   with the people who brought the checkbooks. And so this could so that's they'll take the money
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.720]   people who want to go watch, put all the effort into the launch of their own streaming,
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.760]   streaming gaming platform. They'll take the money of the people who just want to play
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.200]   Tetris with them with a rock B to it. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.480]   I don't know if it's still going to be this way, but before the before the world ended and I was
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.560]   flying every week, almost every time I was on a plane, I would walk up and down the aisle and
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.680]   see people with giant iPads just playing candy crush like multiple people per airplane. It was
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.480]   so ubiquitous. And that's that's what the gaming market they had was. And I think they and they own it.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:33.440]   Mac is not though, you know, I have to say a lot of PCs are sold for gaming. There's no reason a
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:40.080]   Mac couldn't be a gaming platform. That game we were just playing was unity. So you could put that
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.440]   on a Mac, I guess. Yeah, the market share doesn't say the iOS market share totally supports it and
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:51.040]   they do a lot of matches. Enough Macs like no one wants to make a metal port of, you know,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:56.080]   what zero horizon zero dawn and set up on the map. The spire is still around. That's the company
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:03.040]   that for years was best known for porting PC games over to Macs. They're still a going business.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:11.280]   Let's see. They have Knights of the Old Republic out. You could save six, which I am playing on a Mac.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.480]   You can't play it. It's going through a time capsule. Yeah, that's the problem, isn't it?
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:19.840]   It's it's older stuff so much. Yeah. I don't know. It's what streamers are playing.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.240]   Should Apple pursue a gaming strategy? They go back and forth on this.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:29.200]   Well, they have a gaming strategy. Yeah, they have a very good one, don't they?
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.720]   Yeah, they're good with what they're content with what they've got, I guess.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:38.240]   I met a kind of AAA desktop PC Mac gaming. It's just money more work.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:43.760]   Yeah. It's a shrinking market. I mean, the mobile and the other casual game market is the one that's
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:49.360]   kind of taking over. I'm not sure that's true. I think so over 60% of the market.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.640]   Yeah, but I don't think that desktop gaming is a bad market. It's bigger than Hollywood right now.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   I'm talking about market. I'm just saying that if you have the mobile market, more of
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:03.200]   you have a big chunk of the mobile market and those things. I mean, building a, I think that the
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   other thing is the Apple TV is capable of a lot more than we're still seeing even with most of the games.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.160]   So Apple's got still plenty of room headroom before they need to look something else.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.480]   When they add the horsepower to do high frame rate 8K, they're going to have a horsepower to do any
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:25.680]   kind of game. I don't think that game quality is really important over top of
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:33.840]   necessarily the really high rendering. I think that the big thing is that there's a need to
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.720]   make a game really playable. I think somewhere in the future, someone's going to figure out how to
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.080]   make it broadcastable. I know that they broadcast games, but they're really hard to watch.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.320]   I know the gamers like watching them, but for an average person watching them, they're convoluted
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:53.040]   and complicated and don't make any sense. I mean, eventually we'll see games that are really designed,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:58.320]   not like Overwatch, but I mean, like really designed for broadcast. And we haven't seen that yet.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.240]   They figured out our broadcast chess and poker. We'll do that with video games.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.920]   Two? Yeah, it's, yeah. But again, those aren't, those are, those are broadcasted, but they're not
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.560]   like football or soccer. No, but I think esports could be. I mean, it's a lot more action.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.920]   And I completely, when they move to an arena, which is what all the other big games do,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.520]   the physical games are. And for 2000 years, we've gone to see people clobber each other,
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.200]   you know, big round area where we're also watching. And I think that, you know, I don't think that
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:38.720]   it's going to change that much. Let me show you the arena that Dota 2 had. One of their big events,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:46.480]   this is the international Dota 2 games. And they can definitely fill an arena and just can they,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:52.000]   can they do it every week? You know, like this is, you know, sports, this, you know, we oftentimes get
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.720]   excited about esports. And I think that, to be honest, I think esports is going to replace regular
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.160]   sports. So I'm not saying that it's not going to happen. I think this is about to break out
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:07.520]   then COVID hit. So, you know, we don't know. This is, this was May 2020, 10 million dollar prize.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.040]   This is a giant arena they filled with Dota 2 fans. These are the players down here. That's
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.640]   my only thing is I don't know how compelling it is to sit and watch that. But they.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.280]   And again, I think that the issue is how much do they pay for the tickets and how often could
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.960]   they do that? And I think that if they get the right game, they could do it all the time, or
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.640]   maybe they don't need to even do it in a arena. I mean, but they can broadcast it. But right now,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.680]   I just find that when I watch them, I'm like, this is, you know, it's, it's great for gamers.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.400]   It's not, it's not a great broadcast experience.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.000]   They need better play by play people. And it maybe it could be.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.520]   It's what they often need to stop.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.560]   Well, they also need to stop. If you know the game, it's very engaging, I'm told.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.720]   Yeah, no, no, that's why you get high, the high average view times and everything else. But,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.960]   yeah, but the thing is, is that the, that, that what you need is to, is to have real camera systems
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.080]   and you need to have real, real comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy. Yeah, they've got to worry about
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.240]   that. Yeah, yeah. You know, you can't be driving them the cameras around with your mice, you know,
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   and, you know, and then, and not have it all just attached to some person running through.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.160]   And all of those things could be done. I mean, a lot of us have worked on things like this for,
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.240]   for a while. It's, it's, it's all possible to put extra game engine systems in there.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.000]   It's just that no one really, I mean, the gaming companies don't really get it.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.040]   And so you just kind of constantly trying to explain, you know, it's running.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.040]   Look at it. I think people are really looking at it. It's, see, this is, I mean,
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.960]   it's one of the reasons Microsoft just bought Activision Blizzard. I think that, right,
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.360]   there's a feeling is out there. There's something, this is a billion dollar business,
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.000]   and we can just figure it out. This is, it was already a billion dollars.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.640]   No, I'm talking about the e-sports side of it. Yeah, yeah. This is the Rogers Arena, 19,000 people
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.200]   for Dota 2. Yeah. I think it's the future.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.480]   Yeah, Rogers. Huh?
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.840]   That's a Rogers. And the Incan. And a Rogers.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.440]   And a Roger. Oh, wow. I think there's no, that's where Rogers is, right?
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.880]   Again, I think it's the, I think it's the future. I think it's the future. I just think that it's
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.120]   got, someone's going to have to crack a code. I mean, because 19,000 is great, but the Steelers
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.760]   fill 70,000 every week, you know, like every week that they play, you know, like I'm just saying
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.920]   that, that at incredible prices and it's sold out for a decade, you know, like, you know,
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.720]   so the thing is, is that that's, but that's the kind of thing that you know, it was easy to get
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.280]   tickets to an NFL game and there wasn't a Super Bowl yet. Well, not those, those things.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.160]   It's not in Pittsburgh. It hasn't been that way for 30 years. So, so that the, but the, but,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.280]   but I think that again, I think that e-sports is it, they're able to show these great things, but
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.680]   when you talk to sports folks, you know, it's kind of like when we talk about streaming, we talk
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.360]   to broadcast folks, but it's like, well, you know, we would, if we had less than 5 million people
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.840]   watching, we would cancel with the show. So, so you have to realize that they're at a different
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.160]   scale, you know, and, and again, I think e-sports is the future. I think eventually that's mostly
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:00.240]   what we'll watch, but what will take it from where it is now to that thing is a actual viewable
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.720]   game. No, I agree. I think you are waiting for the killer game.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.560]   League of Legends, Dota 2, these mob, mobile games are very popular.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.040]   They're just, they're just complex to watch. I think for all the time, whatever it's fun.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.520]   And Mark Zuckerberg is going to be what they work in the Blood Bowl. He's going to be the lead
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.080]   to work in the Blood Bowl. He's going to sign up to watch him fight against Adam from Instagram.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.080]   It'll be amazing. So, six weeks. No, before we go on, can I just,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.640]   tangentially, did you order a Steam Deck? I was just curious.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.480]   I am on the list. I haven't got my invitation yet. The only thing I'm excited about Steam Deck
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.520]   for is it's running Arch Linux, which means that a lot of games, a huge number of games
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.920]   from the Steam library will be ported over to Linux, so I can run them on my nice Linux gaming
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.240]   machine. That's all I really care about. Yeah, I would with benefits.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.680]   I think it's a very interesting device. I mean, obviously, the Nintendo Switch,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.720]   which is roughly the same, it's the same screen size and a little smaller, but roughly the same
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.440]   idea anyway, has done so well, especially during COVID. The Switch has been a real go-to device.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.640]   So, yeah, I'm so tempted by the Steam Deck.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.080]   Even if, as a guy who's just said, I'm in a casual gaming, I don't want to spend hundreds of
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.560]   dollars on the device. It seems as though, we've all been there where you can tell when someone,
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.400]   a tech company has a new product or a new thing that's like, "Oh, this is the future of the company,
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.240]   and we've really thought about this, and we're really invested in this, and we think this is going
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:38.080]   to be a revolution, and you're like, "Yeah, 50% discount, discounted 20% two weeks after release,
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.920]   discounted 100% two years after release, but the Steam Deck, it really seems as though they've
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.240]   really thought out how to make a platform for a lot of really cool things, and I'm just as,
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.680]   I'm pretty excited about it myself, especially at that price point, good heavens. I wonder,
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.680]   I wonder how much profit they're making on each one with the build goods was?
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.280]   Probably minus, minus money.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:06.480]   I'm just checking in, oh crap, they have a very old phone number. I put down whatever the $100
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   deposit or whatever, I was just checking to see where I am in the reservation queue.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.280]   I mean, I have to buy it, right? Because, you know, for work, for work,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   I think this is coming to you too.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.160]   Do it for the kids.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.280]   Yeah, they just start to ship it.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.000]   I need a Windows PC in the office because, you know, for balance.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.040]   Well, that's why I have a,
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:34.240]   but it's like, if you were to have like a bar graph of how much Linux and how much Windows is this
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.720]   much Linux and it's this much Windows. I keep it as a few other gigabytes, which I'm regretting
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.120]   now because Elden Ring fills it entirely.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.480]   It's basically...
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.160]   It's not a SD card, and apparently it's not terrible.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.480]   Yeah, yeah. So, well, anyway, we'll see.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.440]   I think that's why a lot of people are waiting to see if Apple actually does
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   announce their own game controller or some sort of game thing for iPad that would turn it into
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.880]   more of a console, like you just plug it in and it becomes more of a console.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.120]   I know there's third party ones, but if Apple starts making moves like that and they start,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.880]   especially as they get into VR and VR is going to have a much bigger gaming focus,
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.880]   just if they could complete that pipeline.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.760]   I think people will...
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.880]   That's when we'll start to...
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.520]   I believe it when I see it, basically, with Apple and those are sort of the things that I'm
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.200]   looking for to see how they go with gaming.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.640]   [sings]
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:30.800]   It is week five of the standoff between Apple and the Dutch dating apps.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:38.080]   Five million euros every week up to a total of 10 weeks.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:46.880]   Apple has written a letter to our Deruge authority consumer and market in the Hague.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.520]   Dear Mr. Deruge...
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.040]   This is from Apple's Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andier explaining why
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.120]   what we've done is the only way to do it.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.280]   For one thing, to ensure that our app is compliant with Dutch law
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.600]   and that it has not applied Dutch law outside of the Netherlands,
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.320]   Apple had to ask developers to submit a separate binary for the Netherlands
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.400]   storefront if they intend to use a payment service other than IAP.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.600]   What else could we do?
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.080]   We had to do it.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.160]   This is the same approach Apple and developers use in jurisdictions where there are unique legal
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.720]   issues. This is not costly or difficult for a developer.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.200]   Dating apps are familiar with this process and, in fact, engage in it voluntarily.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.280]   It's not simply possible but common for a developer to do that.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.080]   Apple believes this solution is fully compliant with Dutch law.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.840]   We take these obligations very seriously.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.160]   I understand that we have a difference of opinion
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.520]   that may ultimately have to be resolved by a court.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.080]   I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution that will allow us to stop paying you five million.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:04.960]   You're a weak.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.800]   Anyway, they make their case.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.200]   I still love that he's over dating apps.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:19.280]   That's just the company that actually raised the lawsuit.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.960]   If they find a way to settle this, then I'm sure everybody else is going to talk
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.440]   about it as well.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.200]   Every time we introduce this topic, we're talking about Dutch dating apps.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.080]   Is that the way that Apple is getting out of paying taxes on my phone?
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.760]   We'll go touch on those taxes.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.160]   That's it.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.640]   You take half.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.160]   Or is that a reverse?
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.560]   It's a reverse Dutch sandwich.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:52.480]   The markup had an article on the location data industry and how location data brokers are getting
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.400]   around restrictions from Apple and Google.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:03.360]   It's a $12 billion a year market of companies that buy and sell location data from your cell phone.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.680]   Entirely legal in the US.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.080]   However, of course, as you know, Apple would like to stop that.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.680]   They cracked down in the SDK.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.280]   But there's nothing you can do about first party.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:22.560]   And so the markup is explaining how information is being collected by these apps.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.960]   And the apps get around it in their privacy policy.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.800]   You know, Apple's policy requires apps to disclose what data they're collecting
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.640]   and how it can be used and get consent.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.400]   But it doesn't require the apps to disclose exactly
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.880]   who they're selling the data to.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.440]   So the apps say in the privacy policy, we may share data with partners to improve your experience.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:51.280]   As always, the markup was the same same publication that uncovered the fact that life
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   360 was selling location data to a dozen location data brokers in 2021.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.600]   So it appears that people are still doing it.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.800]   They're still getting around it.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.840]   And I still think that what we're watching Apple do, I don't know about Google,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.720]   but we're watching Apple do a slow constriction.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.680]   Like doing it all at one time just creates a whole bunch of new fights.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.600]   You know, but they're, you know, so they're going to just slowly pull it all in.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.960]   And I think that they're just going to become more and more private and harder and harder to do
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.920]   over time.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.360]   But they're just not pulling all the strings in and all at one time.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.200]   So just, you know, it's going on still.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.920]   And these companies are basically sleazy companies are.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.520]   You know, using weasel words to get around it.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.760]   You know, Apple could stop it.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.800]   They'd have to watch the data coming and going.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.480]   Well, if we, if we have a third party app store, they cannot stop it.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:46.880]   Right.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.000]   Like you can kiss a good point.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.360]   Like, you know, like, like you can kiss all of the, all your privacy and all of your location data.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.440]   You can kiss it goodbye if there's external app stores.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.880]   Like it's going to be gone.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.520]   Well, let me think.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.240]   Is that the case?
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.680]   Just because the payments go through somebody else, the app still has to reside on the iPhone
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   and still has to do all of the things that Apple requires that to fill.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.640]   No, if it's an ex.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.360]   No.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:16.240]   But what our fine Congress is proposing is to force Apple to have other app stores on the app.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.320]   And if that happens, you won't have any of those protections.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:18.640]   No, I just agree.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.160]   That doesn't mean no.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.400]   That's on other apps, another app, other app stores.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.360]   That's what that's the one.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:23.440]   Okay.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.480]   So I let's say I buy an app from a third party app store.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.640]   It's still has to run on the iPhone and it still has to adhere to Apple's policies in the
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.400]   iPhone regardless of where I purchased it.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.160]   So we'll see.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.840]   I don't think so.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.480]   Of course so.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.640]   Because it has the information.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.040]   It has that it's going to get that information and it has to be treated as a first party citizen.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.480]   According to that law, they cannot.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.680]   They can't they according that.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.800]   I think it's all about payments.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.280]   That law is so poorly written.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.480]   It's all about that law.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.160]   It's not about look, once the Apple, the app is running on Apple device,
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.840]   Apple controls what can happen to that.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.600]   You know, what data comes and goes, whether the what entitlements,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.840]   it's still going through Apple's API.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.040]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:01.600]   You're really.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.640]   I don't think so.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.120]   You're really.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:03.680]   I don't think so.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.160]   A man argument.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.600]   That's a completely strong man argument.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.400]   You should read the law.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.840]   You should read the law.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.360]   Like the law is so painfully nebulous that it could absolutely be construed that they
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.000]   can have their own app store and that they can't and Apple can't basically
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.800]   cannot constrict their ability.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.120]   They have to be treated the same as they were on the other app store,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.960]   which means they're not going to be able to do that.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.160]   Apple's not going to be able to to apply those rules to that app store.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.280]   All right.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.560]   We've had this argument before.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.600]   It's OK.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.480]   Maybe Apple has great plans down the road to prevent this,
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.560]   but you should know your location data is being still sold without any particular
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.160]   restriction on Apple's part.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.120]   It's a cat and mouse game where the mouse has like $12 billion
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.880]   war chest to try and avoid the cat.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.520]   Apple is going to change its policy.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.880]   Actually, before we do that, let me let's take a break and then we'll do that
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.760]   because we have a fine sponsor in the shape of zip recruiter.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.400]   How will you people are hiring people are going back to the work.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.200]   In fact, everybody understands that if you're going to get people to come back to work,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.320]   you've got to make the workplace better for them.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.960]   We did it.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.640]   We just set up four day work weeks for our employees.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:27.280]   According to a zip recruiter, 90% of employers plan to make enhancing the employee
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.200]   experience a top priority this year.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.520]   Yay.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.960]   Yay.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.080]   More money.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.360]   That would be a start, right?
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.840]   Make your employees feel more valued.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.560]   Get them involved in decision making, focusing on company culture,
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.960]   offering learning opportunities, allow for more flexibility and work schedules.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.560]   I think I saw a survey today that said 92% of employees in the United States would
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.840]   like a four day work week.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.600]   We actually, I think the state of California required us to have a vote.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.360]   [laughs]
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:57.840]   So we did.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.560]   We had a vote a couple of months ago and it was unanimous.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.240]   Yes, we won a four day work week.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.880]   Now, you're doing the work to make your place a great place to work.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.440]   Now, when you need to add employees, where do you go?
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.240]   Zip recruiter.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.520]   Right now, you can try zip recruiter free at zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.960]   Zip recruiter's technology finds the right candidates for your job

[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.920]   which means you can look at those candidates, say, "Oh, I like that guy.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.640]   I like that gal.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.280]   Let's hire them," and invite them to apply.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.800]   Research shows that when people are invited to apply, they apply
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.040]   and they're much more interested in the job as a result.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.720]   No wonder Zip recruiter is the number one rated hiring site in the US.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.480]   That's thanks to G2 ratings.

[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.280]   Thank you, Zip recruiter.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.160]   We used them.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.280]   In fact, I think John Ashley, I think we got through Zip recruiter.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.480]   Some of our best employees.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.720]   Some of our best employees.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.320]   Zip recruiter.com/mac.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.600]   Break.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.680]   [pause]
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.200]   Apple will soon offer face.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.680]   Did you get an invitation?
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.560]   Apple was halted.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.120]   No, Apple has halted sales of online store in Russia, though.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.560]   Oh!
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.120]   There you go.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:33.760]   They listened to us.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.200]   They were working in real time.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.880]   Very interesting.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.120]   Sorry for the false alarm on the invitation.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.800]   You got me all excited.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.120]   Definitely.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:41.600]   This is good.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.240]   This is important.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.880]   So, wow, that's huge.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   Mac rumor is a 9 to 5 MacBooks reporting.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.960]   Yeah, Apple halts all sales in Russian online stores as Ukraine invasion continues.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:58.000]   Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister that we quoted earlier in the show said,
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.040]   "Thank you, Tim Cook."
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:05.280]   When browsing through the Russian Apple online store, all of Apple's products are now reporting
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.520]   they're currently unavailable for sale.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.080]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.480]   Wow.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.760]   That was the right thing to do.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.400]   I think so.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.760]   Absolutely.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.480]   I think so.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.960]   They've did it before, apparently.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.920]   According to 9 to 5 MacBooks, they paused sales in Turkey last year.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.960]   In that case, because currency was going up and down and crazy.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.200]   Yeah, the rubles having it.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.640]   But you could blame it on the ruble.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.200]   There's reports that people were actually...
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.840]   People who couldn't get to exchange their rubles,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.680]   take out cash at ATMs,
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.680]   were taking the rubles and immediately buying any high ticket items like iPhones
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.840]   that they kind of want while they're still some value to them
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.920]   before they replace their stock and now I think it costs 10 times as much in local currency.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.160]   Wow.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.560]   Well, that's a big story.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.280]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:55.760]   Thank you.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.480]   Breaking news.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.160]   Breaking news.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.240]   I love it.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.280]   Ramp up the pressure.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.880]   Just get it into the streets.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.320]   You did it before Russia.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.120]   You could do it again.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.760]   Interesting to see what the crypto exchanges do,
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.960]   because they're getting some pressure too,
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.600]   and they're trying to explain the technical limitations to politicians
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.200]   who really don't understand the technology.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.520]   Well, in fact, that wouldn't even say it's a technical limitation.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.520]   I would say it's part of the promise of cryptocurrency is that no government,
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.560]   no political situation can bypass it, but it does raise an interesting...
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.120]   If we've cut off Russia from all of the traditional financial markets,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.680]   but they could still get payments in Bitcoin, the question is...
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.880]   What can they do with it?
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.360]   But also, refugees are using it as a way to move their cash out of the country
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.760]   and no other feasible financial instrument work.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.320]   Right.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.520]   Yeah, I understand from a kind of philosophical point of view,
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.760]   why if you're a cryptocurrency, you might say,
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.120]   "No, no, no, we have to be beat..."
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.800]   And just as Switzerland said, and now has changed its tune,
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.720]   we have to be above the fray, because that's the whole thing,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.680]   because we don't want to go to governmental interference.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.920]   But when Switzerland stops being neutral...
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.280]   That's a big deal, isn't it?
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.440]   You probably need to think hard about it.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.040]   Do you think you're life choices?
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.320]   I think you think you're life choices.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:12.800]   I love it.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.400]   Oh, I finally get this story.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.440]   Apple will soon offer Face ID repairs without replacing the entire iPhone.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.720]   I don't even care anymore.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.360]   I don't even care.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.800]   You have an iPhone 10 answer later.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:36.560]   You can replace the Face ID, that unit in the notch there, the TrueDepth camera.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.840]   So you have to obviously be an authorized Apple repair facility,
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.200]   but you'll have access to the TrueDepth camera service part,
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.760]   which is all the camera modules, and you can now swap those in.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.640]   I think I'm sure there is some sort of process for verifying it.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.120]   Yes.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:53.680]   Right.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.720]   Yeah, there's a lock process.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.080]   I think one of the things that makes this stuff problematic over time is that
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.760]   just humans like us are not good with scale.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.200]   Like when you talk to anybody who works at Apple or YouTube or Facebook,
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.680]   the simplest of things, when you multiply it by a billion users of anything,
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.880]   becomes really, really tough.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:15.120]   And for Apple, just economically, it was easier to capture the device,
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:20.000]   give you a new one, and then send it to a depot and have that all done at massive scale.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.800]   It's much less convenient.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.400]   It's only efficient because they were doing so many at once.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.160]   But like they eventually broke down the process for doing other things in store.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.760]   It's a way better customer experience.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.000]   It takes time and it takes logistics and it takes a lot of maturity and the technology stack,
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.600]   and then they can start doing it.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.760]   But we often just look at it and go, "Oh, they're being jerks."
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.920]   Sometimes they're jerks, but quite often it's just not incompetence is the wrong word,
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.000]   but it's just like, it's a tough technical challenge with a lot of technical debt,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.320]   and it takes them a while to extricate themselves from it.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:59.120]   So this is the Mark Gurman expectations segment of our show, not rumors, expectations.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.360]   He expects three new Apple watches.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.720]   This is not news, really.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.840]   We've been talking about this for a while.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.640]   A series eight.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.920]   They vlogged with the Leo.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.120]   He says, "I think it'd be great if Apple discounted the iPhone SE and so do I,
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.560]   but suddenly it's on four blogs."
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.960]   An updated Apple Watch SE, already selling it, makes sense to update it.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   And we had heard the rumor before that it would be an extreme sports Apple Watch.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.920]   So he says, "A garment competitor."
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.720]   I expect, I think, probably.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.280]   He does also say, "I would not expect any major new health sensors this year."
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.200]   Nope.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.000]   That's interesting, because there'd been a lot of worries about that.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.400]   They keep buying companies that, Apple's wanted to do a lot of these sensors for a long time,
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.760]   and they keep buying companies that say, "We're a year away," and so they buy them,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   and it turns out, they're not a year away.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.400]   They're as far away as Apple was, and then, of course, it's a whole process to get them
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:58.560]   commercialized, and in some cases, going through with the ECG, getting it approved on a country
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.680]   by country, health authority, by health authority basis.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.560]   But they're trying, it's just going to take years still to get a lot of them.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.440]   This is a tweet.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.400]   It's neither a rumor nor an expectation.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:16.480]   It's an assumption from Mark Gurman would assume, he says, that these would drop on
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.640]   March 8th. He's talking about new colors for iPhone cases.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.960]   We're really scrap, the script, the bottom.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:27.440]   It's interesting, because the iPhone SE and the iPad Air could be just press releases.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.280]   Like, in 2020, the expectation was there was going to be a March Apple event,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.200]   and then 2020 happened. The iPhone SE 2 was a press release.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:43.280]   The updated MacBook was a press release. The iPad Pro with the A12Z processor was a press release.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.160]   They changed everything. They became just a bunch of, "Well, look, they're up for sale now on apple.com."
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.000]   I don't think an M2 could be that, and I don't think a new redesigned Mac could be that,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.560]   or it would be a disservice to them, not to have the story told.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.320]   But there's a lot of things that Apple could do as press releases, if they had to.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.800]   If things get worse in the world, for God forbid, but they had to start moving products.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.600]   It's interesting, because this tweet from Mark is from Sunday.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:13.920]   He's still saying March 8th as of Sunday. But you're right, they don't have to have an event.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.480]   It's so weird, though, he knows a date for the event, but he doesn't know which Macs are going to
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.760]   be in it. A lot of people know it, but that stuff's all known. I was decided a long time ago,
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.800]   but it's interesting to know who knows this, but not that. It's such a
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:33.440]   really entrail sort of an activity. I think it's easier to know when the event is than what's in it,
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:41.200]   because in a lot of keynotes for a lot of different companies, the information is very closed.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.160]   So you know that there's an event because there's a bunch of people that are setting up for it
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:51.200]   and getting ready for it. So there's some movement there. But especially on one that doesn't have
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.600]   a live stage, whether you don't have to rehearse, that information can be kept very, very close to
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:04.320]   the best for a very long time. And usually people working on those kinds of keynotes aren't even
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.440]   interested in knowing what it is. Knowing what it is is just visual material that you're not
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:15.600]   carrying around in your bag. And so they're willfully not interested in knowing what I've worked on
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.680]   a variety of different keynotes for a lot of different companies where I was just as surprised
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:26.640]   as everybody that was watching. I was there for a week or two. I didn't know, I didn't want to know,
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.560]   I didn't have any interest in knowing. 2013 at WWDC keynote, I was sitting next to,
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.720]   I think it was Gruber, Dalrymple, and Snell. And in front of us were a couple really high
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.080]   ranking Apple people. And that, you know, Phil Schiller's ass, Mac Pro gets put up on the screen.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.200]   And they're like, Oh my God. And it's like they'd never seen or heard about anything. They were
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.480]   as shocked as anybody else that it just wasn't anything that they were working on.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:56.400]   And again, in a company that's secretive, nobody knowing, having information is not power. It's
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.200]   it's a liability. You know, and so, so you don't want to have anything that you don't that you don't
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.120]   have to, but you don't have to. Well, and you don't want to share anything you don't have to because
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.480]   you've been in point. Yeah, that gives away your location. Yeah.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.600]   I don't know if I like this idea. Michael Douglas has been Franklin. I always thought that
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.960]   Andy and Akko would be the best Ben Franklin. I don't know why maybe it's the side. Oh, yes.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.800]   Yeah. The turkey is a little bit of sustenance for our forefathers. You would be so good as Ben
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.920]   Franklin. Apple TV has apparently announced a Ben Franklin limited series starring Michael Douglas.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.360]   He's gonna have to gain a lot of weight. I mean, Zach, yeah, yeah, I'll have.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:48.320]   But but also, you know what, in terms of having had lots and lots of indiscriminate sex,
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.120]   he's right up there with Ben Franklin, according to his autobiography. So I didn't know. I don't know.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:26:00.400]   It'll be based on a book which I actually have read for the first time called A Great Improvisation,
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:09.440]   which is a history of Ben Franklin's diplomatic visit to France. And it was quite a good book.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.360]   So it'll be about Ben Franklin negotiating with France, I guess.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.640]   Anyway, gives everybody a chance to practice their French. I don't know.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:27.840]   What else? Skydance. Sky. What is it? What is the name of this? Skydance Studios. Yeah.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:34.640]   Apple TV has apparently made a deal with Skydance, reportedly among the richest, according to 9-5
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:41.520]   Mac, as the service builds out his movie catalog. This comes from a variety. Paramount Pictures
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.800]   partner Skydance Media. Apple Mega Deal from variety. Skydance is David Ellison's
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:56.080]   scores. One of the richest packs in Hollywood. Pretty good for a young man. What does Skydance
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:05.440]   have? Mission Impossible. The upcoming sequel to Top Gun. So apparently these will be exclusive
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:13.360]   on Apple TV Plus. I don't know. Released first there. The deal apparently, under the terms,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.640]   guaranteed at least two fully financed feature films a year with budgets up to run roughly
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:25.680]   $125 million, a pay out, guaranteed payout of up to $25 million per picture.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:33.280]   They also did the great movie Blush. Have you seen Blush? No. That's a short on Apple TV. It's
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:39.120]   really good. It's really, really well done. It's a little animated film. It's a little animated
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:45.840]   short. It is so good. Variety points out that this isn't such a huge amount of money that
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:53.600]   Netflix paid $400 million for two movies in the knife's out franchise. Lord of the Rings, of course,
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.400]   a billion dollars just to buy the rights. And then they had to make it. Brian Reynolds and the
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.680]   rock are probably getting huge and Gal Gadot plug and huge amounts of money from Netflix too.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:08.640]   I heard that the first season of the Lord of the Rings thing for Amazon was like $550 million
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:15.120]   or something like that. Pretty pricey for a billion. They paid a billion just for the rights.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.080]   The first season is like, I heard it was like $500 million. It looks good. You saw the trailer?
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.640]   It's what the Silnerillion, right? It's a marillion. Yeah, because it's funny. We're
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.320]   watching it was on the Super Bowl or something. We're watching. And as soon as I saw that giant
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.200]   statue, the guy said, that's Lord of the Rings. I know. So this is going to be kind of an origin
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.000]   story. It's a pretty cool. Yeah. Lord of the Rings, power of the Rings, some rings, rings, rings,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.840]   rings, all the way down rings. Oh, interesting. No wonder this young man is so successful,
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:54.080]   David Ellison. He's the son of Larry Ellison. There you go. Oh, oh, okay. I'm sure his dad gave
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.280]   him some good advice. Take this $1 and don't waste it. According to Variety does not have to capitalize
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.520]   his own movies. You don't have to ship sign. All you have to do is take people to the golf course
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:10.080]   and tell them you'll give you millions of dollars. Oh, as you can say, you're doing very well, young
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:19.680]   man. Because he has some connections. He Ellison developed the old guard. That was good. Was it?
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.760]   I liked it. It was. I enjoyed it. I loved her. But yeah, the Tomorrow War, which I did like,
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.200]   but I think was not well received. Those are both for Amazon, weren't they? For prime.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.760]   Charlie's Tarot was Netflix. Yeah, I think Netflix Netflix. The Old Guard was Netflix. The
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.200]   Tomorrow War was Amazon. I'm pretty sure. The Gemini man anglies costly flop.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:46.240]   The relaunch of the Terminator series, Terminator Genesis and Terminator Dark Fate.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:53.520]   So some, you know, he does a lot of big science fiction, anything, I guess. Apple TV plus also,
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:58.000]   I've been watching this news because I go modern Carrollco movies. Yeah, it's Carrollco. Yeah,
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.640]   yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Terminator from Carrollco. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:10.240]   The Apple is apparently bidding hard for NFL football. And they're bidding against Amazon.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:16.720]   It looks like the future of NFL Sunday Night Football, the Sunday ticket will be on streaming
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:23.520]   only next year, which is very terrestrial. Very. Which is the best. I mean, it is the
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:29.680]   Sunday Night Football is the best broadcast. That's the one you want. That's where all the money is.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.320]   Bigger than Monday Night. Oh, yeah. Monday Night. Well, the team that used to do Monday Night Football,
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.680]   when they moved it to ESPN or whatever, the team that did Monday Night Football became
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.680]   Sunday Night Football. That's the one you want. Yeah. And that team is the one that does,
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.000]   I mean, it's the best graphics, best commentators, best, you know, production. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.440]   Amazon has already grabbed, they're talking to Al Michaels, right? But Al says, I want to,
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:57.680]   they already got Al's producer. So Al, before he signs a deal though, the great Al Michaels,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.880]   who must be in his 80s by now, he's been around forever and ever. He says, I want you to get me
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:08.240]   a good partner. So now Hollywood's watching, everybody's watching with interest to see,
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   you know, who Amazon can get to work. That's going to be Ryan Reynolds.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.840]   No spoilers, because I got Ryan Reynolds. I think it probably be a football player.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.840]   Right. That's going to be great. You'll be, I think it'll be a football player.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:27.760]   He could play a football player. It's Ryan Reynolds. Where was I reading this? I must be,
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:33.360]   I'm following this. Tom Brady somewhere. Well, I think, you know, they were talking about
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.160]   Collinsworth, who, well, that's, that's who's in the current, the current. He currently works.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.520]   He's great. He's great. Sunday night is going to be this year is Mike Toreko,
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:51.120]   is replacing Al Michaels and I think Collinsworth. But then, then these former cowboy stars like
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:58.320]   Romo and I think he's packaged up for a while with, I think, is it CBS? Yeah. Yeah. He's,
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.080]   they're paying him a lot of money. He's the, he's the, the one I watch right now.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.960]   Like hundreds of millions of dollars for this stuff. He's so much fun. He's so much fun to watch,
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.960]   in my opinion. Listen, I don't want to. He knows because he's recently in the game,
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.640]   and he knows, right? He's passionate about it. Like he just was like, oh my gosh,
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:17.600]   this is what they're going to do. You know, like, like I can see it coming, you know, and,
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.800]   and sometimes he's right. Sometimes he's wrong, but it's just fun to listen to.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.880]   So hear me out. We package it up as TikToks, like, because you can go to 10 minutes now on TikTok,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.400]   and then people can swipe between plays that way you have like immediate dopamine.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.640]   By the way, anything happens. I will say that I think that TikTok is ruining the,
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.600]   ruining their platform with 10 minutes. Like, oh, yeah, that's another,
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.960]   excruciating. So they went from 60 minutes, 60 seconds to three minutes.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.720]   And now they've been out. They're going to go to 10 minutes. That's really,
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.480]   yeah, it was supposed to be five. Yeah. It's not bad because people watch hours of TikTok,
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.680]   like it's not a length of like, no, no one's going to watch vertical video for that.
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:54.480]   People watch it for hours, but the thing like TikTok has trained you that a new experience is
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:59.920]   only a swipe away. And like the attention span is so concentrated. You want that hit every second.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.000]   And like 10 minutes holding attention for 10 minutes on TikTok. I don't know if like Mr.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.840]   Beast could do that. That's like a very big challenge. It takes a huge, it takes a lot of
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:13.040]   production value to make something to stretch something over a long, a long distance. And so,
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.600]   the thing is, is that the reason TikTok works for people who don't have a big production group
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.720]   and writers and things and everything else is because it was short.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:26.080]   As you start to stretch it out, the problem is, is that when you go to TikTok, you want
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.760]   it to be snappy and really cool. And the problem is, is that most people without a budget can't
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.280]   make it snappy and cool, except for someone like you. And of course, us in this show,
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:42.240]   I mean, we can do it forever. But the thing is, is that for that model, I find that like,
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.400]   I get into it and I even see the little player start and I can calculate,
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.040]   this is a three minute TikTok and I immediately just go to the next one.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.520]   Yes. Like like I'm like, this is, I'm like, I'm like, I'll watch this for three minutes.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.400]   You know, so 10 minutes will be worse.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:02.880]   I did not know this, but Guy Kawasaki hired Mark Benioff as an intern at a USC in 1984.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:10.320]   The whole story is on guys, remarkable people podcast. Of course, Mark Benioff,
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.840]   the founder of Salesforce worth $10 billion. But,
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.440]   But he bought equity in them. Yeah.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.160]   He bought equity in them. Yeah. Guy says, I was a software evangelist in the Macintosh
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.320]   division of Apple in 1984. Mark was a student at USC. I gave him a summer intern job in the
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.680]   summer of 84 to write sample assembly language programs. So the developers around the world
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.920]   could see how Macintosh programs were written. Man, I was writing assembly language programs
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.160]   for the Mac in that time frame. I should have talked to Guy.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:45.680]   I was too young. I was too young. Our timing was off.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.200]   Yeah. Bad timing. You should have been a college kid.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.680]   So Mark says, I was too much of a maverick.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:35:02.560]   By all my, all my first software that I wrote was written for the Mac in a 68,000 assembler.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.560]   It was so much fun. I wrote a, in fact, I think I was the first to do a multi-tasking program for
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.480]   the Mac because I wrote an auto dialer because my Bill Boudenboard was only had two modems.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.280]   So I had to write an auto dialer that would dial in the background on a Macintosh. This is in
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:25.360]   84, 85. And it would do it because on the Macintosh screen, there were CRTs,
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:30.240]   there was a brief period of time as the electron gun repositioned from the bottom of the screen
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.520]   to the top of the screen that the Mac wasn't doing anything. It's called the vertical blank
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.520]   interval. And so what I would do in the vertical blank interview would be just enough time to
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:47.520]   stuff like two characters into the Hayes modem buffer, AT, DT, the phone up. And then it would,
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.600]   every, I think it was at 60, 60 times a second, right? Every 60th of a second, it would get a little,
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.000]   you know, millisecond to do that. And then it would dial the number, you know, send it out,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.200]   and then it would listen for a pickup. And if it did, I had a big honking,
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.360]   because I figured you're busy doing something else. You want this to go on, you're doing something
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.000]   else. Maybe you got up, got a cup of tea, you want to know I got into the Boudenboard. So that
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.360]   cute dial, I call it. I think that was an early multitasking first multitasking program.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:23.680]   I could have been, I could have been somebody instead of a podcaster. Benioff says, I learned,
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.600]   while being at Apple that a technology company, a great one is filled with amazing energy,
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:33.840]   vitality, and a sense of urgency. At the same time, there was a great culture at Apple. Steve Jobs
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.440]   had those Odoala juices for everyone. And she asked who messers that we're going up and down the
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:46.480]   hallways, keeping programmers limber. I don't know if they do that at Salesforce. I don't know if
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:52.240]   you learned it. I'll tell you what I learned about Odoala. We used to have, when we were doing
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.920]   ZD TV, when we were doing the site for MSNBC, they did the same thing, probably inspired by that.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.080]   They got a big Odoala refrigerator and they just gave us Odoala. So pretty soon, there was just
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.680]   some people were drinking, you know, they're buck 50 each. So much Odoala, they had to print
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.360]   up some Odoala dollars. And you got a certain number of Odoala dollars a day that you could spend
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.080]   on Odoalas. They made us pay for him at Lucasfilm. Yeah.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:26.320]   That's given away. But I had a lot of... Are they still around? I remember they had a
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.560]   problem with E. coli at one point. Yeah, the super green one was my... That was the one the
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.680]   name. Oh yeah, Odoalas is around. They're probably on by Pepsi. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:42.320]   Headquarters Atlanta, Georgia. Well, let's see. Who's in Atlanta? Oh yeah, the Coca-Cola company.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.480]   Our website currently under construction.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.080]   [laughter]
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.920]   At a Santa Cruz, California in 1980. But they were good. They were like real fruit. It was good stuff.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.520]   Super... The super food one was my favorite. Yeah, I remember the super food.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.240]   Yeah, we couldn't keep them in stock. I had to get the Odoala dollars.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.520]   Poor soul out of riot. Do you have tolerance for more breaking stuff? Oh, yes.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.840]   So this is Apple's statement. They just put out about the sales in Russia. They said,
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.680]   "We're deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and stand with all people who are
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.280]   suffering as a result of the violence. We are supporting humanitarian efforts providing aid for
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.280]   the unfolding refugee crisis and doing all we can to support our teams in the region. We've
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.440]   taken a number of actions in response to the invasion. We have paused all product sales in Russia.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.280]   Last week we stopped all exports into our sales channels in the country. Apple Pay and other
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.920]   services have been limited. RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.080]   the App Store outside Russia. We have disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple map in
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.360]   Ukraine as a safety and precautionary measure for Ukraine citizens.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.000]   Great. Thank you, Tim.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.040]   That's not just a currency thing.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:55.920]   Thank you, Tim. Doing the right thing. That's good. Boy, that's great.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:01.600]   Let's take a little break. Now we can all celebrate.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:07.600]   When we come back, your picks of the week, how about that?
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.320]   Our show today brought to you by literally cash fly, our CDN content delivery network.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:23.760]   We couldn't do what we do without cash fly. In fact, we tried. It was a horrible failure.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:31.280]   When Twit first started out in the mid 2000s, like 2005, I think, first it was download the
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:37.440]   podcast from the website. Oh, that was a failure because, I mean, there were literally, you know,
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.200]   when you put out the podcast and 100,000 people would try to download it all at once,
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.480]   then we asked people to please, we're going to use BitTorrent,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.200]   seed it, if you would, please help us. That didn't work. Thank goodness. Matt Levine,
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.400]   the founder of Cash Fly came to us. This is back in 2006, 2007, said,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.720]   come on, Leo, you need cash fly. Let me help. And we've been with them ever since. We love it.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.040]   Cash fly, because they've got pops all over the world, 50 locations.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.400]   So that means when you download one of our podcasts, audio or video, you're getting it
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.280]   from a server that's closer to you, faster, gives you great throughput, great reliability.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:21.040]   Now they're doing video. This is awesome. Cash fly is ultra low latency video streaming.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:29.200]   Sub one second latency. And you can go live in hours, not days. So ditch that unreliable
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:36.320]   web RTC solution for their web socket live video workflow. And man can it scale millions of users.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:43.360]   It's just one more reason to take a look at cash fly. Cash fly storage optimization system.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.080]   We've been using that for a long time. That's now open to the public. You basically store your
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.360]   content on cash fly, which means you eliminate, you know, those, those bills from your origin
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.960]   servers, your S three bills, you reduce bandwidth costs and your cash hit ratio suddenly is 100
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:05.120]   percent. That's a great thing. And they have fully managed solutions. If you need them with
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.960]   cash fly's elite managed packages, you get VIP treatment. We always have gotten VIP treatment
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.760]   from day one. They're just great 24 seven support response times in less than an hour.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.240]   In most cases, they'll already know of any issues and it'll be working to fix them before the team
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.920]   does. I honestly can't vouch for that because we've never had a problem. We've never in more than
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:34.160]   10 years, never had a problem. Cash fly. They're the best. The CDN we use. If you deliver in content,
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:38.400]   take a look at their ultra low latency video streaming more than a million concurrent users.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:44.240]   If you're doing gaming, lightning fast gaming, zero lag, glitches or outages. If you've got mobile
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:50.160]   content, they've got mobile content optimization makes it easy to your site loads faster on any device.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.280]   And it's a multi CDN, which gives them redundancy and fail over the intelligent,
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:59.920]   the balance your traffic across multiple providers. So you always get the shortest routes,
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:06.720]   you mitigate against performance glitches. In fact, cash lies 10 times faster than the old
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:13.600]   HTTPS method we were using. They're on six continents, 30 times faster than other major CDNs,
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:21.120]   a 98% cash hit ratio. And in the last 12 months, not four nines, not five nines, not 10 nines,
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:28.800]   a hundred percent availability, a hundred percent. And they've got great 24/7, 365 day
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.480]   year priority support. So they're always there when you need them. I love cash. I don't know
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:40.400]   how many ways to say it. Check it out. If you're not using a CDN, bring your usage trends to cash fly
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:47.360]   for a complimentary analysis. If you are using a CDN, find out if you're over paying 20% or more.

[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:17.440]   for their support. Let us do our picks of the week. Alex, Lindsay, you haven't been here in a while.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.920]   I'm dying to know what do you got? So I haven't recommended this one for maybe six or seven years.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.320]   I looked at look back on Macbreak picks, which is very useful for me. I don't know who uses it,
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   but it's very useful for me to figure out if I've said something before. Like, it is like the key.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.560]   Is it mbw picks is calm. If people are not that still up, is that still around? It is. It's still
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.320]   he's still. Oh man, he's still current week. Oh, so you can search for your pick because you
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.560]   forgot, but I don't know. Mbw picks.com never forgets. Wow, I didn't know you were still doing
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.720]   that. Thank you. So useful. Thank you. Thank you for doing that because that's how I get myself
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.200]   out of trouble. So I did recommend this one before, but I'm going to recommend it again because
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:04.240]   it came up a couple times in the last in office hours. And my pick of the week is the
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:10.560]   D San perfect queue micro. All the perfect queues are great. This is what it looks like.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:15.840]   This is the standard for this is as people start to come out of COVID and they start doing
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:22.320]   physical events again, maybe. This is a receiver. And this is a transmitter. And even
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.520]   when if you look back at the Apple thing where Tim, you know, had to like put they put a control,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.520]   you know, a clicker, a clicker in the case and then they ran out today to get it to Tim.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:40.000]   This was it. This is what this is what this is what they were using. A lot of people have a
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.400]   lot of different clickers. This is the one that everybody uses. Like everybody. It's so bad if
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.000]   it doesn't work. I used and remember when Apple came out with you could do your keynote slides
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.480]   on your iPhone. Yeah, I was giving a speech to HBO and Palm Beach. And it failed on me. It was
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.720]   so embarrassing. I had to go over my laptop. I had to figure you need this thing. This is the
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.160]   thing. So there's the one we use in events is bigger. It costs more money. It's got a big big
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.560]   thing that has a big arrow that goes one way or the other so that we can follow along. It's it's
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.880]   quite a thing that you can see the bigger one there. And I have those two. But this is the one
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.680]   that I carry my bag, which is this micro queue. And this will go hundreds of feet. It will work
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.880]   every single time you push it down. You can program it to different channels. And so you can program
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:32.400]   this. So it's wireless. It's wireless. This is a wireless connection. This plugs wired into your
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:38.960]   computer. So this is a USB receiver that then sends forward back and so on and so forth. And
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.680]   this is this part is wireless. And don't get the one. There's ones with more buttons. It's just
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.520]   forward and back. Don't don't do the other ones because you don't hit the wrong one in front of
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:55.600]   a lot of people. So anyway, so. So but this is it's great. It comes in a little pack. And I just
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.880]   brought it up because I was like, you know, people keep on asking about it. We've had a bunch of
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.160]   people asking about an office hours. And I was like, I should probably just mention it again.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.240]   It's been seven years or eight years or something like that since the last time I talked about it.
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:12.080]   And I still use it. You know, I don't. I don't speak in public as much anymore. But but when I did
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.120]   back in the before days, it was important. And even in my office, though, sometimes I use it,
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.800]   because I want to sit there and talk about something. And I just want to push a button to go to the
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.720]   next thing. Sometimes when I'm doing events, not events, but broadcast where I'm walking around.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:33.440]   It's great to have there too. So it's very nice. I see that they must be getting hit by chip
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:40.000]   shortages because there are numbers that I had products are kind of at a. Yeah, I noticed that
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.040]   right before we came on, I was going to look at the thing and I was like, well, it might be hard
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.160]   to find. But if you can find them, they're around. And the ones you just showed, they're available.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:53.760]   They're not as done. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Thanks to chip shortage, man. That's killing everybody.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:47:01.920]   Yeah. Very nice. Q is from D. San D S A N dot com. They're not web developers. We go to their
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:08.960]   website. Yeah, I love it. I don't find that. It's very basic. Very, very. Yeah. The funny thing is,
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.360]   this is a lot better than it used to be. It used to be just like it didn't look like they had
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:17.760]   updated since the late 90s. And so what we loved about it was is that it just seemed like there's
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.000]   no way these guys could be successful. But this is what you see. The hardware is what you see
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.240]   everywhere. Like it's just when you're doing events. So you use you use all these speaker
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.880]   timers and all that stuff. I don't. So I we use the speaker. We have a speaker timer or we used to.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.520]   I used to use a speaker timer. And then I use that large version of the perfect Q is what you
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:40.320]   see a lot behind backstage. Yeah. And if you listen really carefully, sometimes someone will turn the
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.440]   speaker up a little too high and he goes boop boop. And you ever hear that? If you ever wonder
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.520]   what that is, that's because what happens is you when we don't connect it directly at the computer,
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.600]   a lot of times we don't let speakers actually forward their slides. Right. That big arrow goes
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.360]   one way or the other. And then an operator is when they say clicker isn't working,
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:01.760]   their clicker is working just fine. Right. It means the operator was watching the basketball
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:09.360]   game or something like that. And so so the so the um but those so every speaker go bloop bloop bloop.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:16.160]   Yeah. Yeah. That means that means if you hear it over and over and over again, that means the
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.480]   speaker the the the the Q is working. The person supposed to hit the next button is not working.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:30.560]   So very, very awesome. Desan. Now you know, you know, you know, you know,
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.240]   exactly. Andy, you're not go pick of the week. I've been a little bit distracted for the past
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:42.800]   15 minutes because I had picked out my my pick of the week, which is this amazing like
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:50.080]   store slash web app called hero forge hero forge.com, which has this amazing 3D interactive builder
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.240]   that lets you design your own like many figures, your own like role playing game, many figures.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.080]   And you think that, okay, well, fine. It's an elf. Okay, it's an orange elf. Okay,
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:07.520]   the elf is having a no, you can customize to such a great degree. And it is so fun to play with
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.400]   that. Like I realized, oh, I wonder how I wonder how difficult it would take to do a Jim Dalrymple
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.840]   minifigure during the show. Wait a minute. And have you? There is there is a link in the show.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.600]   I'm going to click the link for there's a picture. There's a there's a screen grab. And then I actually
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.720]   took it a link to the actual like design in the hero forge.com. It does look like him.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:35.360]   That's a Heineken bottle. I understand. Yeah. And that's and then and then like after but that's
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.080]   like as of like eight minutes ago, because I can I've continued to work on it and realize, oh, wait a
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.040]   minute, that's not actually a Heineken label. The Heineken label is square. So, oh, and he said he's
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.960]   getting married. So I should put a wedding ring on his on his finger. We should be wearing an Apple
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.520]   watch too. And oh, his sneakers, his knees shouldn't be wearing like high tops. You should be
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:50:01.200]   wearing like a Steve Jobs style like and oh my God, it's just so much fun and so easy to play with
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.280]   this that you will just basically like in the middle of a zoom meeting just be clicking clicking
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:11.280]   clicking making many figures of everybody in the meeting. And the fun thing is you can export it
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:18.320]   as an STL file so you can print it on on a printer or you can just or you can order one. So and if
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:24.640]   you want the if you want this just Jim Della Rumple mini figure, send them $45. They will send you
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.640]   a painted like printed version of it. How do we get this? I guess we'll put in the show notes.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:37.920]   We'll put the link. Don't put the image in the show notes. Let's put the link to the hero forge
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.560]   and then and Andy's hero forge and if you want to fix it more and do more, go ahead.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.600]   So you if you log in, then you have more access to more features. You can give them a background
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.800]   and stuff like that. And then you can find it. Wow. Right. And again, all the if you
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.120]   elf ears, of course, you can give the person elf ears, but I'm like, get it.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:07.280]   You know, I just bought a bronze set of chess pieces for my nice chessboard. Maybe he should be
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:13.200]   the king. I hear a voice. You could you could do a whole chest sex. I'm sure you could put a
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:20.480]   crown on his head. Oh, yeah. I am so I am so impressed by like how deep and how how much fun this app
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:27.440]   is because again, there's for it's also such a great user interface because if you just want to
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:34.240]   bash something together very quickly, you can get like within 75% of the Jim Della Rumple mini figure
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:40.400]   in like minutes. But then like it hides like the advanced stuff. Oh, well, do you want to actually
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.760]   minute? I've just put a beer bottle in his hand. Do you want to minutely pose the arm? So yes,
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:50.480]   absolutely. Great. Here's the elbow. So I wanted the beer bottle to be leveled because of course,
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.360]   it doesn't want to spill any. And so if you want an iPad mini in a back pocket,
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.760]   it's like you can't you can't create your own custom objects. But I think if you were that
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:08.400]   ambitious, you could spit out the STL file and then like that stuff. I was yeah, as I said, I can't
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:14.880]   just as a thing to play with. I am just amazed by this thing. I'm blown away by it. And I am like,
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:19.280]   I kind of want to send them $45 just to see what comes back. Obviously, the colors aren't going to
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.960]   be they do they're very, very blunt about it. I've added empty beer bottles at his feet. I think
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:33.600]   that's very important. Exactly. You cannot stop playing with this. Oh,
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:43.200]   m g Alex, I want a chess set. I think I'm actually just I'm I'm I'm having a hard time. Like I
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:46.960]   was just like, Oh my gosh, I could because you could put them in a T pose and then you could
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:53.680]   actually I think I can take the models and like read, you know, animate them. I think I think I
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.760]   think we could figure out a way to animate these. So Jim, go ahead, retire. We don't care. We've got
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:05.040]   you. We've got to be a Vtuber now. Yeah. Look at that. That's incredible. How fun is that?
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.160]   Again, my hats off. This is this is why this is the heart. This is a horrible thing for me to
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:14.240]   have found it like one in the morning when I'm like, Oh, I'll just like make more one more like
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:19.200]   round trip of like basic searches. And I was up until like four in the morning because let's like
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:26.760]   let's see if we can do this and again, very nice. Oh my gosh. Hero who's lost Alex hero for
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:35.120]   yes. Hero forage.com. This is their business is printing these and selling them. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.960]   But it costs you don't even have to sign up for anything to play with anything with it.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:45.760]   If you sign up for it, then you can do things like there's there's a photo booth feature so you can
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:51.440]   take pictures of it so to speak. But yeah, it's it's boy. This is great. I want to make
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.480]   the problem is you can't really mess with the face that much, right? So you can't make it look
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.160]   like somebody. Well, also, also realize that this is going to be like a mini tabletop figure. So,
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.640]   I mean, there's you're not going to get a whole lot of detail wouldn't come through anyway.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:10.000]   Right. In terms of what you're looking at on the screen, right? How are you?
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.600]   They'll get close to these about like a big. Oh, they are mini. Okay. They are again,
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:21.200]   they're like tabletop, but you get you can download an sto. You can download a shape file and
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:26.160]   edited to apparently edit to your car. You pay for that. It's eight bucks for the sto.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:32.720]   Right. You also get the money painted for like a lot less. So if you want to. So if you want to
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.680]   what would that be a great like family Christmas present where like game tokens for monopoly,
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.040]   like based on each of each member of the family and the dog. You paint them live on Twitch.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:49.280]   Oh my God. This is great. Yeah. Okay. You've given us a whole new show.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:56.320]   Hero Forge, the podcast. Renee, you're pick of the week. Oh, look, I'm going to go after
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.400]   an acolyle. There's no way to live up to that. I just he just mic dropped and walked off.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.760]   Actually, so unfair. I'm mad at you because I just bought the Logitech Brio camera for Lisa.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.400]   I mentioned she wants to kind of broadcast set up in her office.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.560]   Maybe I should have bought this. You don't have to be madly because you can't buy this yet.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.960]   This is like invite. Oh, this is like a meta pick because we were talking about
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.680]   pre-show. If you're a you know, if you're a Twit plus plus subscriber, you'll you'll see all
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:27.040]   our hijinks before the actual show starts. We were talking about webcams and this is like an
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:37.520]   escalation. This is like a rapid. It's just it's a webcam, but it's got so much stuff. It's a $300
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:45.840]   sensor. So yes. Yes. Yes. So yeah, this is like again, a CMKBHD of webcams. It's just it's got
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.680]   it's mirrorless. It's really, really fast. It's got it's designed to look like something that
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.520]   wouldn't really come out of Apple's lab because it's got like it's a little bit fuzzier than Apple
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:01.280]   would be, but it looks almost like Leica inspired. Not whatever the opposite of steampunk is future
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.640]   punk. Hope the punk I forget what these pretty cool. Yeah. Aspirational brand is and it's designed
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.280]   to look like really radical sitting on, you know, in your setup so that people can see what a cool
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.320]   setup you have. And it's just looks really nice. The software is really nice. You can't buy it yet.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:21.680]   You can sign up to be put on a list of people who may be allowed to buy it at some point. They say
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.840]   it's in private beta. I've seen some people, you know, a lot of our Twitter friends who are in that
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.560]   space have have tweeted about like the Casey Neistats and Mark has brownies and Ken Kishandas and
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:34.560]   you know, various people like that looks really nice. Industrial design is really nice. I haven't
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.200]   had an opportunity to try it yet, obviously, because I'm not cool enough, but it it does look
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:44.480]   like if you really want to be like the cool webcam kit on your block, this is this is your next
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:51.200]   obvious support for the Mac, which is, you know, nice. You know, all the cool kids are using the
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.200]   Macs and these influencer spaces. Any way they got to do that. Yeah, it looks like they don't bother
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:02.880]   with any other platform. Wow, that's nice. This is a very aptly website. Okay. Okay.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:08.160]   If 300 bucks is the key, I mean, of course, you can use a DSLR, everybody knows that, but that's,
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:12.800]   you know, this is this is something you could dedicate to it for 300 bucks.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:21.920]   I was almost gutter that the vlogger cameras, both Sony and Canon make vlog cameras that are
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:28.080]   only like five or 600 bucks. Yeah, I love the I love the Brio. I was I still, I mean, one of the
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:33.760]   reasons why upgraded my my limp is camera was like, Oh, I'll be like, I'll be like my friends on
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.640]   Mac break. I'll have like a really nice like like large, the large sensor frame mirrorless camera
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.680]   as my webcam. And it's like, can I do it better? Can I get a better signal than this? Not really. Okay.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:50.480]   Yeah. Yeah, I keep on testing. I have a lot of webcams and but the only one that we bought in
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.240]   Matt. Yeah, I know like I like five or six different ones with an arms reach and I don't have that
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.720]   one yet. But I have, but we the one that we've standardized on for years has been the Brio and
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.680]   it's been really successful. And we've probably bought 150. Good. So I just accidentally
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.240]   stumbled onto the right one. Is that what you're using right now, Andy? Yeah, exactly. Okay,
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:15.040]   that looks really good. Yeah, yeah. It's the software. The software is a little bit annoying
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:21.680]   in that like I'll get it set up like the software is great because obviously let's you it has enough
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:26.480]   it has enough pixels that you can like zoom in and zoom out and then you can adjust your like
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.440]   your centering and stuff like that and adjust brightness contrast stuff like that. The only
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:36.320]   problem is that I'll like spend my waiting time on going for the show to start like getting this
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:40.240]   absolutely absolutely perfect. And then the connection starts and then it will like reset back to the
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:46.640]   default. I'll have to do it again. My reason I'm using a 70 millimeter is that when you when I'm
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:50.880]   using anything that you at all wide, especially like if it's 24 or something, I look like golem.
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:56.240]   Just my ears received really far. I need as much compression as possible. I need to be flattened
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.480]   and that's what this does. That's actually a good idea. That is the argument for you using a
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:09.920]   SLR is you could find the right lens for your face. Yeah, that's what that's why I like the idea
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:15.280]   of having a 4k video but having it so far back that I'm not getting the sort of distortion fix.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.600]   So it's a really good happy medium. Good. Well, I guess I ordered the right thing. I also ordered
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:25.840]   this because she wants to have dual monitors. She's going to replace the iMac with her M1,
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:31.120]   first generation M1. But then I found out as I remembered this and I thought, wait a minute,
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:37.520]   you can only drive one monitor with the M1. This just came out today from Hyperdrive. I have purchased
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:43.600]   many Hyperdrive docking solutions in the past. So I know this is a Sanhoe, which makes this a good
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:50.880]   company. This is a 4k multi-display docking station for those old 13 inch and 14 inch MacBooks,
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:57.120]   which has two HDMI ports, too many display ports. They say driverless, you can drive.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:04.560]   Am I crazy? Will this work Renate? Can I drive two monitors with my M1? Nothing?
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:10.800]   I don't know. I don't know enough about this. I say you can with that. I've seen in hacks that
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:15.440]   you know you install software and stuff. They say no additional software necessary. This is nice
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:22.160]   because it's wedge shaped. So you put the laptop right on it and it's got 18 dang ports.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:27.440]   I think we talked about this before. I don't think but this is now out and available 250 bucks.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:33.680]   There's one with even more ports for $299. And they say see driverless setup. I don't know if
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.720]   that means I can do too. Well, I'll let you know. You appreciate Lisa for letting us know.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:47.920]   Yes, I will let you know. They are now for sale from hyper shop.com.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:57.600]   All right. All right. All right. I think we're done. All right. Renate Richie,
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:03.120]   youtube.com/RenateRitchie. What you got going? I'm trying to do previews like more in-depth
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.960]   previews of everything that I think could possibly be coming up this year, especially in the Mac
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:10.880]   space because it's so new and so exciting. And also a lot of Silicon stuff because I think we're
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.520]   on the verge of like four nanometer, three nanometer. I know Johnny Saruji is just crushing down those
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.720]   process nodes with his bare hands. Amazing. That intense stare. He's like, this will go to three
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:28.320]   nanometers. And it's so interesting to me. In 2010, we went to the A4 and 2020. We went to the M1.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.320]   And I'm just, I'm already wondering what this decade of apple silicon is going to do for us.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:38.080]   I'm diving deep into a lot of that stuff. Very nice. RenateRitchie.com/youtube. Thank you, Renate.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:46.640]   And I go WG. BH Boston. When's your next appearance? Very, very great news. 1230 on Friday as usual.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:53.040]   As most of you will want to just go to WGBHNews.org to stream it live or later. But after two years
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.640]   away from the wonderful open air studio at the Boston Public Library, Boston Public Radio is
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.800]   back in their studio. So I'm going to be actually live from the Boston Public Library. So if you
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:07.120]   are in the Boston area or hanging through town, you want to excuse to stop in, buy yourself a cup
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:13.920]   of coffee at the cafe and watch my look like when I'm trying to be presentable towards people.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.480]   By all means, come on in. Very good. Thank you, Andrew. And if you are into this stuff,
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:26.160]   all of this production stuff, you got to watch Office Hours, Alex Lindsey's office hours dot
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:35.120]   global amazing place to learn everything. We have launched 2.0, Office Hours 2.0.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:41.040]   Is it out? So if you go to the, it's actually Office Hours, it's like, you know, YouTube slash
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:48.400]   today was us actually. Let's talk about it. Pick each other's backgrounds. Like, oh,
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:53.840]   the light is just a little off the background. Can we move this over?
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:02.160]   And so, but 2.0 is, you know, we've now, instead of streaming natively from Zoom, we're now going
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:06.560]   through this hardware system that's streaming. And it's still, you know, we're still working
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.800]   out a couple of the kinks in it. But what you're seeing now is something that looks much closer to
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.600]   broadcast. And it's going to take us through this year. And so we'll be tweaking a lot of things.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.760]   And we're, you know, pushing the really the outer envelope of what kind of show you can do on Zoom,
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:24.880]   you know, and, but it looks, it looks pretty good. That was that looks like one of the old ones.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.680]   Yeah, this is the prepping to switch. All right. So now we see prepping to switch.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:36.080]   Let's just like today's show that it should be in the new, new format, right?
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.840]   You can see the, yeah, big. Well, let me see. I have to have to make sure I'm on in HD on YouTube.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.040]   Yes. Yeah, it was limited to 720. Now it's 1080p.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.880]   1080p. Oh, look at that. Oh, and that's coming in. And if you skip around a little bit,
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:53.280]   you'll probably see the super sources and, you know, like there's a lot more. And the thing that's
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.240]   interesting about this is that the production, the production for this is being run by people
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:03.760]   all over the world. So literally someone's cutting the show on a webpage somewhere in the world,
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.160]   you know, and there's a team that's putting together. So the sound is being managed out of
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.880]   the Philippines and all kinds of, and you know, the lower thirds are being generated automatically.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.200]   So when, oh, those lower thirds are automatically, those are nice lower.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:23.600]   Yeah, those are. So those are generated based on who is on screen right now. So it's actually
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:29.360]   reacting to the system. So it's a, it's kind of a big brain. There's so much nicer than our lower
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:34.240]   thirds. Look at that. There's so good looking. So, but that again, and then when we do the super
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:40.160]   sources, when there's like multiple people on the screen, you're actually, what you're actually
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:45.360]   seeing is the super source gets built. That whole look gets built automatically, not that one.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:52.560]   That one's just a, a gallery view. But when it builds a super source, it, that's being built by
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.000]   who is answering the question. So someone asked the question, people raise their hands,
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.680]   say, I want to answer the question, then I say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, to the right people,
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.320]   or to the people that have in the order that I want them to ask, answer it. And then it
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:09.280]   tells the switcher what to do. And so like that is being generated automatically. That's not,
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:14.240]   someone didn't have to figure out where it was. So John, you might be out of a job, John.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:19.360]   Still need someone to cut it. Oh, okay. In fact, the funny thing is we expect
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.600]   probably 30, 40 people by the summer, 30 or 40 people somewhere in the world be running the show.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:29.680]   It's not going to go, we're not doing less people, we're doing more people because,
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:32.960]   you know, it's a great opportunity to learn how to run, you know, bigger events.
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:33.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.000]   You know, so it's, so I see,
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:42.560]   YouTube is putting the segment and what the question being answered is at the bottom of it.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.880]   Is that done automatically as well? Or somebody to write that?
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.080]   No, that's Jeffrey Powers.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:51.040]   Well, it's somewhat automatic. So our question system keeps track of all of those things.
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:52.000]   So it keeps track of the time.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.280]   But somebody's tape it in.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:53.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:56.880]   No, no, they don't have to type it in. They download it and then upload it into there.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:02.080]   So it's not, yeah. So our Q&A system is keeping track of what we're going to next,
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:06.160]   and it keeps all the time stamps. And then that's being added. That's being formatted.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.480]   It's automatically formatted. And then Jeffrey Powers, who is another YouTube personality,
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:14.640]   takes it and moves it in. And so yeah, so a lot of that is generated largely automatically.
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:16.880]   Really? We'll probably use the API to do it later.
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:17.520]   Really nice.
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:18.560]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.160]   Very, very nice. Amazing.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.240]   Office Hours 2.0.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.520]   Office Hours. That's global. If you want to know more about it.
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:31.040]   And if you want to hire this genius to run your next streaming event,

[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.760]   090.media.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.520]   The rest of us are not for sale.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.720]   Although I might design a hero for you.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:43.760]   Here you go.
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:48.640]   I've been working on my little dude here.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.760]   Oh yeah, nice. I have no idea what he's wearing a kilt.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:52.560]   I know.
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:53.120]   Rumps leg.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:53.600]   Rumps leg.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:54.080]   Rumps leg.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:54.400]   Pippin.
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:58.480]   This is a rum slag went back into the past. This is a rum slag.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.920]   It's pretty cool.
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.800]   He was in the game.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.160]   He's about to announce Star Fox.
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.280]   Yeah, it's so funny.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.800]   So fun.
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:10.960]   Makes me want to pick up Dungeons and Dragons just to have a character that I can play with.

[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:24.800]   And do I see an iPad sitting there on the table?
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.160]   Oh my goodness.
