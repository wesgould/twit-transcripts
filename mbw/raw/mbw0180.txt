[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   >> Hi, I'm Leo LaPorte and you're about to see a special
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   episode of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   This is not the usual Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   This is the live event we did at Macworld on February 12, 2010.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We called it Macworld Live.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And it features Heather Gold, the comic.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Macquin, his amazing folk music from Mythbusters, Adam Savage,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and the Rock and Roll America's favorite sci-fi rock and roll band,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Warp 11.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So it was a live stage show which we recorded in its entirety
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and you're about to see.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So without further ado, please get ready.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Let's go to the stage at Macworld Expo, 2010, Rock the New Era,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and Macworld Live.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hi everybody, how you doing?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So here we are at afternoon of day two of the Expo.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Have you guys had a chance to get on the floor?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Have you been able to get anywhere close to the vendors you
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   want to get to?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But it's fun out there, right?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   The vibe is good and everybody's happy and we're having a good
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   time, right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   What?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   All right, so this is a very special feature presentation for me
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   because at Macworld last year, Leo came up to me and he said,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   you know, we got to keep this going.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He goes, community needs a place to meet, to be face to face.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You know, this is very worthwhile and this coming from probably
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the most influential, famous person who makes his living,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   talking to people virtually, you know, all year long, but he said
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   face to face is important and community is important.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And if you know Leo at all, he's just such a kind, generous gentleman,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   he really believes in the value of relationships and the value of people
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and, you know, just human connection is very important to him.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And so he provided me a lot of guidance, a lot of support,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   a lot of encouragement through the year.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So to be able to welcome him here to give a feature presentation,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   you'll see all the great stuff that he's put together,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   is particularly gratifying.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So please give a huge backload welcome for Leo Laport.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   This guy's great.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We really has kept Macworld alive, so we really appreciate what you've
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   done for the community.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Paul Kent, hey everybody, how are you?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Good to see you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Hey, why are you standing up?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Is that a standing ovation?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Of one?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And look it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Are you going to broadcast the whole thing with your laptop?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Please do.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   By all means.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'll tell you the story about that.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So it's very good to see you.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   This is Macworld live.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   This used to be David Pogue's gig, but they bumped him upstairs and he
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   was a big keynote.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I hope you saw that yesterday.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   David's so great, isn't he?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Very talented guy.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He very kindly let me take over Macworld live.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So the idea of Macworld live is it's a talk show.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know, if there's something wrong, Dane, I need, I just don't
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   feel comfortable out here.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Can you bring me the ball?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   All right.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman of the international
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   stage and technical employees, Iatsy, thank you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   They are a beautiful job.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now we're talking.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Oh, Dane, the clock.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Very important.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'll explain.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Dane Golden is executive producer of Twit.TV, our Internet
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Network.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He's a great guy.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Are you talking to somebody on that?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   No, you're not.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   There's nobody on the other hand.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Go ahead and enjoy.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   He likes to -- so the clock, we have to have the clock and the
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   ball are part of the studio at Twit Live at the cottage that I
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   do the show from.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And I do so many hours.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I do about, you know, six or seven hours a day, six days a week,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   five days a week.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So I need something bouncy to sit on.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And, you know, when we were setting up the studio, Colleen,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   who's our great studio engineer, who's backstage right now,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   running the live feed, because we're feeding this live.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Hello, everybody in Twit Land.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Colleen and I had a big basket at Costco and we were going down
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   the aisle.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I said, "That'd be kind of fun to have that."
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I bought this big clock.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And if this clock now is the most important thing on the
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   network, if this clock is not in the shot, people in the chat
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   room start getting irate, they say, "Where's the clock?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Where's the clock?"
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So we thought, "I better have the clock on stage so we can do
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   this."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So we're going to do this like a talk show.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   We've got a great lineup here for you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Heather Gold, who is a wonderful comic, does a show on our
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   network called "Tumble Vision" all about community building,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   community bringing people together and getting them to have a
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   good time.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We also have a rock and roll immortal, a legend.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The man who founded the birds, Roger McGwen is here.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And he's going to perform.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He has his seventh string and invented a guitar.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   This guy is the ultimate geek.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Roger actually has an entire solar powered house.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The first time I talked to him, he had built a solar power
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   cooler.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And now he's got a solar powered sub zero.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So he's really upped his game.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I'm not kidding.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So we'll talk to Roger McGwen and he'll play for us.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Following Roger, another Mac geek and legend who lives here in
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   San Francisco, Adam Savage of the Mythbusters is here.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And then we're going to wrap things up.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's going to be a fast paced hour.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   We're going to wrap things up.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You see we've got a rock and roll band here with an
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Amaz, America's favorite sci-fi band.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They do Star Trek covers.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's amazing.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It's not a cover.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's Star Trek rock and roll.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Warp 11 is also here.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   They're going to perform.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And don't leave.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I want you dancing.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   We need a mosh pit.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Now I've been told I'm not sure which the Warp 11's front
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   woman is Kiki Stockhammer.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You might remember her.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   She was the demo goddess at many trade shows, Mac World for
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   years, of the Amiga Toaster.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Remember she would do these great video wipes and stuff.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And I've been told that either Kiki or Roger McGwen is
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   wearing latex today.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   She's one or the other so I'm sure that will be exciting for
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   you.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So are you ready for a good time?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Mac World Live.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   This is really fun.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Let me get rid of the ball because anybody want this?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I think it would hurt you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'll just roll it down the aisle.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's like a mini prisoner episode, right?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Heather Gold, to start us off.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Heather, come on out here.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   [applause]
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Here we go.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Did you really give that away?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Apparently.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   That's all right.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You know, we buy them by the dozen.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   That's what every guy wants to do with his blue balls.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It'll be pawned for the next eight minutes.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Sorry, I won't kill you that way.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I promise.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Wow.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   This is -- I'm kind of -- I mean, I have a lot of jokes, but
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Leo, I have -- first of all, I just want to say --
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I have a lot of people.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   This is a lot of twin army here.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Big love.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   [applause]
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I am blown away by this group of people.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I mean, you go on the show and it's like -- the chat room is just --
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   like, Google Buzz, but nicer, much nicer.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I've been kind of destroyed by Google Buzz in the last day.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Have you used Google Buzz?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I have been.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's not pleasant.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I'm buzzing right now.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I bet.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   The coat.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Are you warm?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know, I should take this.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Can I make you a coat?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I'm not going to take it off the -- I accidentally -- there's a
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   more Drogue malfunction.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Oh.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I thought this was Linux world.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I'm sorry and I have a tux.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It could have been worse.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I was wearing this.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I dare you.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We put it on?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Sure.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I think you should go on the floor after the case so people don't
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   recognize you.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They have rumble.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I mean, the jets and the sharks.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Let's go out.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I mean, just call yourself an army.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I mean, I'm not going to get a gun.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I'm going to get a gun.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Guys, okay, this is just a request.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Please, your next event makes some other
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   t-shirts for women.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Just pretend they're going to come.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Maybe they'll come if you make the shirts.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So I'm married.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Anyone else here?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I am married in four states in one country.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Including one of 18,000 couples married here in California.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   [applause]
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   My wife, who also tells me to get off
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   on Twitter every five seconds, is on the other side of the country in med school.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   But we have a great marriage.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's a lot of work.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   But it turns out that half the country does not want me to be married.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And the other half wants to pay to watch my wedding night on pay per view.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And it's the same half.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's the thing about how it works.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   [applause]
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Especially in Utah, their pay per view, you know, porn is high.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You guys look at the data.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Really incredible correlation there.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So one of the things I've noticed, part of my geek love, is that geek guys and lesbians have a lot in common.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   We're like, "Send me the same tribe, okay?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Everyone's got to stay with me.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Chunky glasses?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Chunky, usually, footwear of some kind.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Hoodies, right?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Prius?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Some kind of gear, spend a lot of time at the hardware store.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   A lot of gear, strap to the roof of the car you don't need.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Spend a lot of time in love with chicks who won't give us the time of day.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   We totally...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Princess Leia!
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Princess Leia is the link between lesbians and geek dudes everywhere.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I do.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I have a poster on my wall.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   It's like a Barack Obama poster.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It says, "Hope," and it's just got a beautiful Leia on it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's true.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I wish I could remake it, but we think Lucas might not like it.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I think I could share it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   It was a prop.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So I used to work at Apple.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Anybody else?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   No, you're all at Macworld and none of you actually worked at Apple?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I think they're not allowed to be here.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You're not allowed to...
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Shh.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's coming.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Okay, are they let's even watch?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Secretly?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Maybe Twitch streaming?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It works.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I hope so.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Hey, guys.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Women at Apple.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I used to work there before, you know, the Great Powerful Laws came back to Apple.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And then after I left, along with, you know, five, six thousand of my best friends, one
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.680]   day we all left, I had to use a PC at a job, a little Sony Vio, and it occurred to me after
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.400]   using this PC for about three months that Microsoft is like the Christians and Apple
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   are like the Jews.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.000]   Okay, follow me here.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.600]   First of all, Microsoft are the more popular of the two, so let's start there.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.400]   They take these conventions that they don't come up with.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   They just take the whole thing they don't come up with and they go, "That's catchy!"
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.040]   They're just going to borrow it, graphically, your interface, the calendar, you know, whatever.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.000]   And then they change everything, right, to make it more complicated.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.840]   It's got to have a father, got to have a son, got to have something in between, got to have
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.160]   a hell, got to have it in some...
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.280]   Is there a world in the Christianity between hell and hell?
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   Purgatory.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.480]   Have you developed for Microsoft?
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   Yes.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   Yes.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   And then...
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.200]   And then they got to make it all complicated, right?
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.680]   Like the sun and the ghosts and the right click and the right mouse button and it's too
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.680]   easy, you know.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.160]   We don't feel like we're doing anything.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.760]   We've got to add stuff and statues and places to bend and jump over stuff.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.480]   And then, you know, they have a leader that says he just doesn't think, but it's all for
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.920]   the people, it's not for him.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   He just suffers, you know, the mockery, it's not about him.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:50.000]   And then they've got a fear-based proselytization, mostly.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.960]   You know, they go into countries, they go into other little companies, they take them,
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.120]   they suck them in, sometimes they disappear, sometimes they absorb, you know, they're
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.120]   saying, "Oh, no, you have saints.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.200]   Oh, no, we have saints."
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   And mostly their success comes down to one thing.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.720]   It's marketing, marketing, marketing.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.960]   You know, you think it's in the Vatican, it's in every museum, it's in every book.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.200]   I better learn this stuff or I'm going to be damned for eternity or worse, incompatible.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   Okay.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.760]   Yeah, Apple, on the other hand, right?
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   It's all about being different.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.920]   It's all about a little pain to be different on the eighth day.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.080]   Are there any Jews here besides me, am I the only Jew in the room?
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.880]   We please out yourself Jews.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.280]   My Jewd are not so great.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.760]   Three of you, four of you.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.400]   You can come out.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.560]   You know, by the way, it's much edgier to be out as Jewish than gay in San Francisco.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.320]   So come on, be a trendsetter.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.200]   So you want to set yourself aside, you want to be different, you can't do everything
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.320]   like other people.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.280]   You should think very hard about how you do everything right.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.920]   You should have neurosis about it.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.760]   You should have therapy about it.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.680]   You should do user experience studies forever.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.240]   You should anti-alias everything unless it's very small and then you can't mix the linen
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   and the cotton.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   There's a rule for everything.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.080]   It's very complicated.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.000]   It used to be incredibly hard to convert.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.920]   They'd turn you away three times.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:16.160]   I've never paused for like a group, painful ground before.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.440]   And then, oh god, there's a lot of people who, you know, started out that way in life,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.200]   but they don't really practice anymore.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.720]   They just kind of connect to it in this vague cultural kind of way.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   The bagel, you know, things kind of look nice once in a while.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.680]   But then, you know, the great thing is when the era becomes a little bit mobile, when
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.480]   people move around, nobody knows how to deal with mobile, like a wandering Jew.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.600]   It's true.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.440]   So, you know, you may have thought that we were vanquished.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   Now we're victors.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.040]   Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try with Microsoft, they'll always have windows,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   which is like Christmas.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.280]   It will be shipped in your throat no matter where you are.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.320]   So it's just a joy to be here.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   I love the geeks.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.440]   You guys are my people.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   And more small t-shirts.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.520]   That's all I ask of you.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.360]   And let's please share some love to Leo for creating a wonderful space for us.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   Thank you.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.320]   Come on over and have a seat.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   I was going to, I'm going to ask everybody who comes out here and I ask you Heather.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.560]   Got it.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.680]   I feel like I'm with Johnny, only, you know, hang in here.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.160]   So what your first experience was with either an apple or a mac and touch.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.840]   You're so young, it's probably with a mac, right?
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.000]   I had a mac plus.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Did you?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It did.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I'm so young.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.280]   I had a little ram disc that you used to start it up.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.440]   I didn't know what that was though.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.200]   At the time I got it in college.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.760]   And I spent a lot of time in the end of a printer.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.760]   I couldn't afford that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.680]   So I'd print in the library in college.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.440]   And I was always really last minute about everything.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.240]   And then I finished the paper for in the morning and run off to go get something to eat.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.760]   And come back in the dot matrix printer would have just printed the whole paper in one
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   line.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   That doesn't happen.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.160]   You know, good old days.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.280]   And you went to work for Apple.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.280]   At a college?
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.200]   And I knew almost nothing about computers.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.320]   Like I used the laptop, no, not out of college.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.800]   I used the laptop.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.480]   I used the computer to write papers.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.160]   I went to Apple after I'd worked in Hollywood.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   Oh really?
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   Doing what?
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   I worked for New Line Cinema.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.400]   But rest in peace is now part of New Line, AOL, Time Warner.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.640]   And that's how we're going to get national healthcare really.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.040]   It's just one company.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.920]   We'll all work for it.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.720]   And I was interested in working at that point what I thought was going to be interesting
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.960]   was to work between Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.760]   And I painfully enough I did go to law school.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.520]   Although I usually am pretty in the closet about that.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   So I was part of a small group at Apple in the mid 90s that was really trying to help
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   create webcasting.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   It was very early.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   See, I find that interesting.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   Mid 90s.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   Because that's where we're doing now.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   There were four or five of us.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   Maybe seven.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   We worked in music.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.480]   And we had to be all on the DL about it because, you know, the lawyers, there was a contract
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.160]   that was signed with Apple Records and we weren't supposed to do music.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.960]   So I ran a music site called Music Fan that didn't, we couldn't put Apple on it.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   Really?
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.360]   I never even heard of it.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   Well, it was that successful.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.760]   I did a lot of enhanced CD stuff.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.160]   I remember that, yeah.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.040]   And early early webcasting.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.360]   We wired, we did the Grammys.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.800]   We wired the Fillmore and a bunch of venues.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.120]   Sort of created early remote webcasting.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.800]   And it was pretty, I mean nobody knew, it was early enough that you could go when you
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.840]   were meeting a people and say, there's this thing called the Internet.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.560]   And their face would go really, you know, and then you could act like you invented it.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   Would you have a, yeah.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.320]   Oh yes, I know about that.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   I created it.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.840]   Yes, and then people would fight over.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   Do you pay us for streaming your show or do we pay you for the rights?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.440]   You know, there was a lot of those kinds.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   So I was doing deals.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.240]   I was doing deals.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.840]   You use a Mac now?
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   Absolutely.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.320]   I could not, unfortunately, now use anything else.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   Right.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.360]   I've been in a destroy and spoil.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   We, you know, I was going to ask everybody how they use Macs today and I realized that
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.720]   we use Macs very heavily to stream a lot of our hosts like you are using a Mac and we
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.200]   use Macs for Final Cut.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.360]   But I think I have a picture of a way that a Mac was used just a few weeks ago in a very
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   unusual way.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.440]   Do you have that picture from the Apple iPad announcement?
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   Maybe they don't.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   The iPad?
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   Did someone say iPad?
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   Well, so, you know.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   I can use a pad.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   It's a bad name, I know.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   Sorry.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   You can tell you guys.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   I'm a little bit more.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   I'm a little bit more.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   It's a bad name, I know.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.640]   Do you not have a room to try?
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   Sure, I want to show it.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   Well, you all saw it.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   In fact, somebody was doing it here.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:58.560]   We traveled up in Apple laptop and streamed Steve Jobs announcement at the iPad announcement.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.960]   Remember that?
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.600]   I'm on the official Apple video and I was thinking while I'm there, you know, Steve's
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   standing here.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.960]   I'm right there in the audience and he's kind of looking funny at me.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.880]   And I realized when I saw the picture that I had it turned around in the laptop and you
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.480]   could see what I was, you could see him.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   It's an awesome photo.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.720]   I wish you could put it up because he can see him.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   You can see him.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   You know, Pulp Fiction?
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.120]   You know, Pulp Fiction when they open the suitcase and it kind of glows.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   There it is.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   There it is.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   There it is.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.240]   That's, so I got, I was busted.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.840]   I don't know if I'll ever be asked to an Apple if it never again.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.840]   Huh?
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.920]   They never said anything but you know the, um, I was, it was, it was, it was, it was
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.760]   it turned out nobody was, uh, everybody had asked permission and that was their mistake.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.240]   Cause Apple said, no, no, you can't do it.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   And I didn't, I just was there and I didn't ask permission.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.120]   So I just thought, well, you know, nobody's, I should, and so I did.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.640]   We had a hundred, uh, 50,000 people watching.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   It was watching.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.480]   And the, and the best thing is, is that if jobs bust you for it, you just say, oh, I
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   learned it from watching you.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.280]   It's your technique.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.840]   Heather Gold does a show for us called Tumble Vision, which is on what days?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.160]   Thursday's seven o'clock Pacific Standard Time with Kevin Marks and Dub Shultz.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.000]   Two, three people who really know about community, about social media.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.560]   It's a really different perspective.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.720]   Kevin's, you know, hardcore tech guy and Dub in terms of business.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.160]   And I try to take culture.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.480]   We've had some amazing people in the show that Kathy Sierra is an incredible user experience
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   person.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.800]   We had last, last night, Adrian Chan, who created social interaction design.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.240]   We had, um, we had Ali Willis, who is like one of my heroes, creative heroes, who wrote
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.000]   September and Boogie went home.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   For both Wind and Fire.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.400]   Yeah, she's an amazing songwriter.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   And she really started doing social, um, social sites, like in the early nineties.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Like she got Intel, the back, a really early thing.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.080]   Of course, they made her use her, their technology.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.600]   And she told us that destroyed everything, but it's fascinating.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.960]   It's a new, it's a whole new idea, a whole new area.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.360]   And, um, it's a great smart show to listen to if you get a chance.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.640]   I'm going to have you move over because our next guest is ready to go.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   We got to keep on time.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.000]   I hope you're enjoying a Mac world live more to come in just a little bit, including Roger
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.680]   McGwin, Adam Savage and warp 11.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.460]   Before we go much further though, I do want to mention the folks at go to meeting, go
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.120]   to meeting.com slash Mac break.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   That's the place to go to get a great deal on go to meeting 30 days free.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.680]   Go to meeting is that wonderful program that lets you hold meetings online instead of having
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.560]   to, you know, boring old conference call.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   I do in a lot of travel.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.200]   You install go to meeting right now.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.760]   If you go to go to meeting.com slash Mac break.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.440]   And then the next time you want to meet with somebody, you just say, Hey, go to go to meeting
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   software, install like that on their system.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   It's just a little Java, you know, stub takes 20 seconds to install.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.840]   And then they can see what's on your computer screen.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.960]   They can see your PowerPoint, your keynote.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   It really is great.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.720]   We use it a lot here at the Twitcottage.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.920]   And I think you will enjoy it.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.000]   And that's why I'm arranged for a special 30 day trial.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Give it a shot.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.520]   Go to meeting.com slash Mac break.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   They're great people.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.680]   And they've been very supportive of all of our Twit projects.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   So we thank them.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.360]   Thank them for helping to underwrite our Mac world life coverage.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.640]   And now ladies and gentlemen, back to the stage at Mac world live.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   You know Roger McGwin.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.720]   I don't have to tell you Roger McGwin is he founded the birds before the birds.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.280]   He was with the Chad Mitchell trio.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.640]   And we found from 1962, this is a, is it the bell hour?
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.480]   This is some video of Roger McGwin when he's 19 years old with the Chad Mitchell trio.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.160]   If we can roll that video.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.080]   If it takes as long as it did.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:24:00.880]   And we can roll that video.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:10.040]   So great to see you Roger.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   Have a seat.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.600]   We'll see we can work you in here with all these mics.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.480]   Roger is a major geek.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.840]   In fact, I know Roger through a John C. Devorach because you and he kind of were gadget hounds
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.560]   together and he would always tell me stories about you'd have every gadget, the latest
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.120]   thing, the palm and whatever and you'd pull it out.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.800]   Yeah, he was one of the first people I saw with a smartphone and then they really improved
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   over the years.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.440]   I love my, I've got the original iPhone.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.840]   There's an interesting story behind that.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.640]   Yes, my sister-in-law had this particular iPhone.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.280]   She waited in the line and bought it when it was brand new and she took it with her to
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   a restaurant.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   She had had her purse and put it on the sink and the sink filled it up with water.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.080]   It was one of those automatic sinks.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.800]   So the iPhone kind of died for about two weeks.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.440]   In the meantime, she thought it was completely dead and bought a 3G and she didn't know it
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   but it came back to life and so she had two of them but she disconnected this one from
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.200]   AT&T and so I traded her a camera for it because her camera died in the purse too and
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.160]   I put it on T-Mobile.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.800]   So, all right.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.960]   The AT&T guy was here earlier to make sure that the signal was good in here but-
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.120]   Yeah, I'm getting pretty good.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.880]   I'm getting two bars on T-Mobile in here.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   There you go.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   That's great.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   Really?
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   It's a geek effect.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   You told us about the solar.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.480]   I would mention the solar cooler that you did.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.680]   Yeah, well, that started.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.560]   My brother gave me a gift certificate for, I think it was Backcountry.com and I'm not
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.760]   really a camper.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.280]   For me, camping is when room service is late.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.760]   So I looked through the site and I found a solar thing that folded out.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.680]   It was great for charging cell phones so I did that for a while and I thought, "What
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   else can I do?"
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.960]   I got a bigger one, a 15 watt and I charged my Mac with it and that was great and I said,
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   "Well, what else can we do?"
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   Well, we live in Florida and it gets really hot there and they have hurricanes knock the
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.720]   power out.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.280]   We thought it would be great to have an ice maker because then we could stay cool in the
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.160]   summer if there was no power running on the solar thing.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.000]   So we had four of these 15 waters running the ice maker, Solar Ice.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Wow.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.280]   You saw a little clip of that, the local TV guys came and shot that and they thought,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.480]   "What else can we do?"
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.280]   So I'd seen these electric, like a Vespa kind of thing and I got one of those but the four
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.320]   15 waters weren't enough to really make it run.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   So I got 265 watt panels and they were laying out in the driveway and they're kind of in
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   harm's way.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.960]   So I thought, "I'd love to get them up on the roof."
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.760]   And my wife and I talked about it and said, "Well, if we're going to put them up on the
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   roof, let's just do it right."
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   We did the whole roof.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.320]   So now we have a 6.2 kilowatt system that runs two refrigerators so the Solar Ice Maker
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.760]   is a sub-zero now.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   That's fantastic.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.160]   That's a big upgrade.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.360]   So lately, I know you still tour a lot.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.400]   Yes, I did two months in Europe last year and a couple of months in the States.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   And you have this Folk Den project which I think is a wonderful, spring folk music
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   back.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   Yes it is.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.160]   I started this back in 1995 when I realized that there was an absence of traditional music
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160]   out there.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.920]   All the new folk singers played acoustic guitars but they were singer songwriters like Joni
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.600]   Mitchell, Bob Dylan sort of thing.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   And I thought, "What's going to happen when Odeta dies?"
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.480]   Well, she did just pass away.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.440]   And Pete Seeger is 90 years old.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.160]   And I thought, "Who's going to hold up the traditional end of folk music?"
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   So I started putting songs up when I first started doing it there 11 kilohertz 8-bit
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.920]   files, wave files.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.320]   And then gradually I got into real audio and then we got into MP3s.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.720]   So there are about 175 MP3s on my site which is called the Folk Den at McGwin.com.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.560]   And you can download all the MP3s and I won't sue you.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   Isn't that great?
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   I love it.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   So you brought your guitar.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.320]   I hope you will play for us.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   Yes I did.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   This is my seventh string.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   It's got a little 12 string sound.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.720]   And I'm going to do a song we did back in the birds.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.680]   It was about an airplane ride over to England.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.880]   And Gene Clark and I were coming back from London and said, "How do you think this plane
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   is flying?"
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.680]   And I said about 36, 37,000 feet, maybe about six miles high.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.640]   The Beatles had a song called Eight Miles.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.680]   And they had eight days a week.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.600]   So we changed it from six to eight.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.360]   And got some John Coltrane influence, a little Robbie Shankar.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.120]   And I put in some Andres Togovia just for fun.

[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   -Thank you.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.080]   -Wow.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   -Whoo!
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   -Thank you so much.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   -Tell me about the guitars. You invented this?
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   -Yeah, I did. I was coming back from France on Air France,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   and they said they would treat it with kid gloves.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   -Yeah. -Well, not anymore.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   And you saw the video of United Brace guitars.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   Well, all the airlines, too.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   And it doesn't matter how well you wrap them up or anything.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   I got to New York, and the whole back end was caved in.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   -Oh. -And I thought, if I didn't carry two guitars,
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   if I carried a six -- I was carrying a six and a 12.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   -Right.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   -If I could get the best components of a 12 string built into a six string,
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   that would be great to just have one guitar to take,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   sort of the one guitar that does everything.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   So I went to Martin, and Dick Boke is the artist's representative guy there.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   And he and I drew out in a paper napkin,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   the arrangement of putting the extra peg head and the end pin,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   and they made it for me as a custom guitar.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   In the meantime, a couple of guitar players came in and played it
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   and said, "Hey, I like this, too."
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   So they made a run of them.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   It's called the Roger McGwin HD7.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   -It's really good.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   -And the best part of it is this --
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   [guitar playing]
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   Sounds like a 12 string when you do that, but then you can --
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   [guitar playing]
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   Band it or do the --
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   [guitar playing]
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   Things that are hard to do on a 12's because the other strings get in the way.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   -Right.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   -So that's what this is all about.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   -It sounds great.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   Is this all you play now?
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   -I still -- well, when I go on the road, I carry an acoustic 12,
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   a 7 string, a Rickenbacher 12, and a 5 string banjo.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   -Wow, that's great.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   -So we don't fly a lot.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   -I was going to say --
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   -That's why we take ocean liners and trains.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   -Well, Roger got here on the Queen Victoria --
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   -Yes.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   - --all the way around through the canal and up here.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   -Yes, it was really fun.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   When you invited me to be here, I went to Camilla,
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   my wife, who does all the logistics.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   -It's right here, yeah.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   -And she said, "Well, I could fly out there on frequent flyer points."
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   I said, "Ah, that's no fun.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   I'd like you to come with me."
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   So, 10 minutes later, this call -- this email came in from the Qunard line.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   They said, "We'd like you to be -- to do two lectures on the Queen Victoria
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   for a free passage from New York to San Francisco."
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   -Perfect.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   -I went bingo.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   Perfect timing.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   -I can't claim anything to do with that.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   -No, that's just worth it.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   -That's just worth it.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   -And this, I thought, was interesting.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   Camilla, tell me you're taking the train home.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   -Yes, we are.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.080]   -Back to Florida.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   -Yes.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   If it makes it, we tried to take a train from Florida to California once,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   and it broke down in Texas.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   We're helping this one makes it all the way across the country.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   -Train starts supposed to break down.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   -It never made it all the way across the country.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   -Yeah.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   -No, we've gone up and down the coast, lines, and so on.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   -Oh, I love trains.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   I really do.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   -We're kind of winding the clock back to the '20s as far as travel goes.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   And it's much more efficient.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   You know, you can take a ton of cargo, and if you take it in the truck,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   I think you get 12 miles for the gallon of diesel,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   and you get 100 miles on a train.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   -So it is.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   -So it's much more efficient.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   -It's a good way to travel.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   -Yeah.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   You use Macs yourself.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   Do you remember your first Mac?
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   -Yeah, my first Mac.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   This is funny.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   I went to the Senate in 2000 to talk about,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   it was a judiciary committee hearing on,
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.080]   "Is there an upside to downloading?"
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   And I said, "Downloading is bad for big record companies,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   and it's bad for independent songwriters,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   but for performers, it's not a bad thing.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   It's kind of like the new radio.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   -It's a hero.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   I just want you to know.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   I mean, in 2000 to say that, isn't that great?
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   -Yeah.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   -I think that's a bad statement.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   -Yeah.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   -It's a radio, yeah.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   -It really is.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   -It is, because if you get a viral hit,
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   you've got a hit and people are going to buy your merch.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   -So you're going to get into regular radio and out of anything.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   -Yeah.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   Radio's, well, I like XM in Syria.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   I listened to you on Channel 158.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   -On XM, yeah.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   -Oh, and I got that as far out as Bermuda on one of the ocean liners.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   -Oh, that's good, yeah.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080]   -Yeah.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   -Because the footprint didn't work too far south,
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   but it works pretty far east.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   Anyway, I said that to the Senate,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   and it got on the internet, and Steve Wozniak contacted me,
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   because he liked what I said.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   And we got to talking, and he said,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   "You know, I teach a class of fifth graders at my house."
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   And I said, "I'd love to show him how to record on a computer.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   Back in 2000, this was kind of a new thing."
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   And he said, "Sure."
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   So he flew Camilla and myself out to his house,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   and I did teach a class, and we got to be friends.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   And when I got back, in the mail was a cube, a Mac cube.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   That was my first Mac.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   -Oh, it's great.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   -Yeah.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   -That's great.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   Do you still have it?
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   -Yes, I do.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   -It was 9.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   -That's great.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   -It's really fun.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   I got it fired up every once in a while.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   And then I have subsequent Macs.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   I have like two or three MacBook Pros.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.080]   I stepped on Camilla's MacBook Pro,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   and fortunately, Macs can run from external hard drives,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   so I have it running as a media center on it,
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   because I killed the hard drive and the keyboard,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   but I've got it running on external USB stuff,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   and it works good.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   But I got the new MacBook Pro, the Unibody, and I love that.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   -It's beautiful, yeah.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   -I record on that.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   -So you're able to do what you would do in a studio
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   with Pro Tools and Mac.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   -Yes.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   -You've introduced me to the Samsung USB mics.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   -Yeah.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   I showed you that, but that broke.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   So I use the M-box now with some really good condenser mics.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   -Real mics, yeah.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   -Real mics, yeah.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   I've got some real good mics, so.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   -Yeah.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.080]   -But you can do it all on a computer.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   -You can.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   I mean, it used to be that you needed a million dollars to record,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   because the studio was expensive.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   It was like $6,000 a day, and boy,
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   we'd spend days and weeks in there,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   and they do a video, that'd be another half a million dollars,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   and all that.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   So now you can do it on Pro Tools,
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   or I am also a beta tester for Adobe Audition 4.0.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   -That's why you use 3.0.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   -That's on Windows, unfortunately.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   -Yeah.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   -We won't mention that.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   -No.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   But it's a good program.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   It started out in radio.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   I think a lot of radio people do that.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   -That's why I use it.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   -Yeah, right.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   -It was Cool-Edit Pro.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   -Right.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   I kept getting a lot of sessions sent to me by PBS,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   and I did a song for a Bob Dylan movie.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   I'm not there.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   It was another Pro Tools session.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   So I had to learn Pro Tools and record on that to send it back to them.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   That's where I got into the Pro Tools thing.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   -Can we get you to play one more?
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   -Yeah.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   I'm going to play a song that Camilla and I wrote back in 1991
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   about the rainforest, but what's happening in Brazil,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   people will clear it,
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   whole area of rainforest and grow cattle,
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   but they can only sustain it for one year.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   And then it's useless.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   They've killed this beautiful ecosystem,
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   and you can't get it back,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   and you can't even grow cattle.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   So what's the deal?
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   This song's called "The Trees are All Gone."
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   It was on my back from Rio CD back in '91.

[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   Oh, so great. It's nice to hear real music with a real instrument and a real person. I just love that.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   You know that's alarming because a lot of kids think they play guitar now because of like, you know, rock, bass,
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   rock band does it. A garage band. Yeah. But yeah, I think rock band. That's what I'm talking about.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   Rock band, yeah, because at least with a rock band you're making music. Rock band you're pushing buttons.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   It's a mouse. Yeah. It's a fancy mouse. All right. Your website.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   Maguind.com, m-c-g-u-i-n-n.com. And you're on Twitter. Are you on Twitter?
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   I'm on Twitter. I'm Roger Maguind. And you're at Heather without a me. I forgot to mention Heather like Flickr.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   I think Champ always beats me to Heather. So I'm going to get you to move down. We're going to get to the great stage
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   hands to move the mics because we're going to introduce our next guest.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   Hylie Olaport again, breaking into our Macworld live coverage. I hope you're enjoying it. Man, that was a really
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   wonderful day. We had so much fun. Wasn't Roger Maguind amazing for me to sit there and listen to him play
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   eight miles high right there. Yeah. Rocked my world. It was beautiful.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   We've got another couple of great guests coming up, Adam Savage of Mythbusters and Warped Eleven is going to play
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   for you. But before we continue, I would like to mention our friends at audible.com. Audible is a great place
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   where you can get audiobooks. Amazing. 70,000 audiobooks. A great selection of wonderful stuff. Anytime you're in the car
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   or you're walking, working out, washing the dishes, doing the housework, you can always have something to listen to
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   with audible.com. It's, to me, a lifesaver. I used to have a terrible commute. That's when I started listening to Audible
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   in 2001. And I have since listened to over well over 300 audiobooks on audible.com. And I'm always listening to
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   more, always finding more. In fact, one of the things we like to do is recommend audiobooks because you can get a free one
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   right now. If you go to audible.com/macbreakaudible.com/macbreak. This is the Audible website. And this is one of the fun
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   things about Audible. You go there and you can browse. For instance, Valentine's Day is coming up. And so they've got
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   a bunch of romance stories like Pride and Romantic, not romance, romantic stories like Pride and Prejudice and
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   Heart of the Night, Outlander. So that's one way to find books. You also, if you notice on the left, you can go to audible.com.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   And they have some great lists like The Best of 2009. They have New York Times bestsellers. Let's see what the best books
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   of 2009 were audiobooks that got the highest ratings from Audible listeners. A lot of these, I have to say, we've
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   already recommended on the show. You see how fun it is? You just browse around. You find a book. You listen to a book. There was a
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   book I wanted to listen to my wife's reading right now by Christopher Buckley. Let me see. He's the guy I wrote. Thank you
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   for not smoking. He's the son of William F. Buckley. There it is. This is the book I wanted to get. My wife's loving this. It's a
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   memoir about growing up with William F. Buckley. It's called Losing Mum and Pup, a memoir. And Jennifer said this is a
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   wonderful book. Christopher Buckley narrates it. It's going to make it even better. I'm going to add this right now to my Audible. Now you
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   can get it free. Just go to audible.com/macbreak. You see I have quite a few books I want to listen to. My goodness. Including
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   another Christopher Buckley book already in there. Wow. Audible.com/macbreak. That's the place to go to get great books. And your
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   first one is free. You can cancel at any time the book will be yours to keep. It plays on the iPod, the iPhone, the
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   Zoom, the Kindle, a lot of devices. Do check though in the device center to make sure it's going to play on the device you're
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   planning for it. Audible.com/macbreak. I can't wait to listen to Losing Mum and Pup a memoir by Christopher Buckley. All right, my
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:26.080]   friends. Time to get back to the stage at Mac World Expo where Adam Savage is about to join us. Enjoy. These guys are
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   old friends. Our next guest is a new friend to me. I know we've all watched him on TV and he's a true and utter geek. You've seen
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   him on Mythbusters. Let's give a warm welcome to Adam Savage.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:46.080]   [applause]
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.080]   So nice to see you. Thanks for coming. Have a seat.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   [applause]
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   It was so much fun backstage because there's just a bunch of geeks like all the other phones out there talking about stuff. The
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   Green Room was hot and happening. Let me tell you. So I'm such a big fan. Everybody's a big fan of yours. How long has
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   Mythbusters been on there? A long time. Seven years? It's amazing. A hundred and eighty hours of programming. The thing that
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   -- Yeah, pretty good. Now this is not your first exposure to TV though because I looked on Wikipedia. Yeah. Okay, you were
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   talking about the people's stock boy in a Charmin commercial. Is that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I told my dad when I was
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   15 that I wanted to be an actor and a good friend of his was somebody hired for commercials way back in the 70s, Charlie
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:40.080]   Kimbro, who ended up playing Jim Dine on Murphy Brown. Oh yeah. And Charlie got me my first agent and my agent sent me out on a
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   call and I got my first audition which was playing Mr. Ripple Stockboy. I played Jimmie the Stockboy.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Now we looked and we looked and we could not find a clip. I'm sure you have clips somewhere. Oh, you know it's out there. I think I just
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   sent somebody to it the other day. We did find this though. This is a billy --
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   [Music]
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   [Music]
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.080]   [Music]
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.080]   Here he comes. That's him. There you go.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   [Music]
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   [Music]
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.080]   And so that video -- And so that video -- By the way, you looked like you were dying out there.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:30.080]   It was freezing cold in November in New York. I love Billie Joel, but that video is so bad that halfway through my showing it to my wife.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.080]   She's like, "Are you in any more of this thing? Can we stop now?" Yeah.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   That's it. That's it. Right there. That's the starring role.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   That was -- Yeah, I did a bunch of commercials for a while. I actually went to NYU for a semester. I pretended to go to class in drama.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   I thought, actually, I was going to be an actor. So how did you get to be a model builder? How did you get to that?
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Well, the acting -- I had already been going out for auditions for commercials for about five years by the time I was at NYU.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   And I was -- I don't know. I got disillusioned and I got out of it. I was working graphic design in New York.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   I ended up moving out to San Francisco, working in theater. The facility with building things led to special effects.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:15.080]   And then, weirdly, the Mythbusters opportunity came up and it was -- that's when the maker of things and the performer come back full circle.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   Couldn't be better. Yeah. You guys work really hard on that show. I did not realize how hard you shoot all the time.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   We shoot 46 weeks a year. It's unbelievable. We don't have any episodes. We turn on about 21 episodes a year.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   So it takes you a couple of weeks. You know, actually, you can tell when you watch the show that you're really thinking about the stuff designed and stuff, but building it.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:40.080]   So you go in every day and you're doing that? Yeah. If you see something built on the show, we built it.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   Unless you're watching someone else build it. We don't take credit for stuff that's not ours. So we really are still -- about two years ago, we got someone to help clean up.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.080]   But that was -- [laughter]
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   A big improvement, I'm sure. We really do take pride that it's all of our hand-y work.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   And we've got our blood on all the tools. Where do you get the ideas for what you want to test?
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   There's a never-ending stream. There's a lot of myths. I just came up with one the other day, which I couldn't believe -- and this happens frequently.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   I can't believe I didn't think of this. Fat mirror, skinny mirrors.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:22.080]   I have a mirror in my bathroom. And I wish it weren't such a good mirror because I look so good in that mirror and I stand and I go, boy, I look good today and then I go out in the real world and it does not work.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   I'm a fan. I have the last mirror in my bedroom is this full-length mirror and it makes me look fantastic. And I like that.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   How can we get the world to look like that?
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   Well, so we want to find out because I have this other mirror in my house, the downstairs bathroom mirror, which actually makes me look like a hobbit.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   [laughter]
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   And I make sure to avoid it if I'm looking for something before I go out.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   You should have had that the last thing as you go out of the house.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   So I figured that we go to a department store, we'd actually start measuring the flatness of the mirrors and seeing if there's some sort of --
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   So there's distortion. Consistent distortion, laterally, horizontally, diagonally.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:05.080]   And then we'd do some experiments in the shop. And then I want to finish by setting up a hall of mirrors in Union Square and having people just go through and pick their favorites and see if there really is such a thing.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   This is true.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   Yeah. So you try to do a scientific method in what you're doing.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   That's actually -- that's the main thing we try and do is the method.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   We realize that our results are often bunk.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   The methodology is sound.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   The method is good.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.080]   If we had the time to do this a hundred times, we feel the methodology would yield something.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.080]   So you told me that the one you're working on right now is this slip and slide video.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   Yeah, yeah. You know the video.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   We have it.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   We have it.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   Okay. Let's show it.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   Let's show it.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   This is a video that was a viral video that was making the rounds of a slip and slide.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   And I fell for it. I saw this and I thought, "This is the most amazing thing ever.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   It's on YouTube.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   Here it is.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   This is the slip and slide video."
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   It's a huge one. And they put water on it.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   Now, it's not only so big, but look, there's a ramp.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   He's going to hit the ramp.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   He goes in the air. And look.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   It's a little cold.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   So.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   [ Cheering ]
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   And I watched that a dozen times. And I said, "How could they be faking that?"
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Well, so.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   It is, thanks.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   I won't spoil the surprise. But we are heading up to a location on Monday to reenact this.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   Who's going to -- who's doing the slip?
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.080]   Well, me.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.080]   Of course.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   You're kidding.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   Well, Jamie, we're both setting up to do it.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   We both have surfer wetsuits. We're going to wear latex jumpsuits on top.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   We sent our PA to Mr. S. Leathers today to get them.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.080]   And we've got this --
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   That might be fun to keep around afterwards.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   We actually figured out that our old ones are all used up.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   The thing is, looking at this video, is it's not about the distance that he flies or the
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   speed that he's going.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   Really, you could do that.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   You could do that.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   He hits that little --
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   He hits that tiny little target. So that's what we'll be really looking at.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   And there might be a certain point at which we no longer feel comfortable.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   Our friend Nick Plache, who's our safety guy at a Hollywood stunt coordinator, will be with us.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   We're going to ramp up to it.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.080]   But really, all next week, we're going to be flying through the air.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   I mean, it's a great job, but it's also crazy.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   You got to be nice.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   You use Max?
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   Yes.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   Okay, good.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   I should have checked before I invited you.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   No.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   That was your first Max.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   My first -- I was just -- so the other night I hosted EFF's 20th.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   By the way, thank you for doing that.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   Really great.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.080]   Really great.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   At the DNA lab.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   At that stage, talking to John Perry Marlow in Midge K.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   Poor, which was like totally intense.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.080]   And I tell them, I figured I'd drop some street cred.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   And I said, "Dudes, I read hacker crackdown on my Powerbook 170."
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   And they both were like, "Mm, nice.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   Yo, Jedi."
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   Yeah, my first Mac was at Powerbook 170.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.080]   I bought with a sculpture that I sold at Catherine Clark's Gallery in Hayes Valley.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Was that the one with the built-in track ball?
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   Yes.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   That little ball.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   It was gray.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   Yeah, little tiny.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.080]   Little tiny.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   But it was the active matrix screen.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.080]   It was.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.080]   It was color.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   Anyway.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.080]   We got to a blackbird to the 520.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.080]   520c.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   Do you use Macs in production?
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.080]   We're actually-
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   We're a solely a Mac shop.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.080]   That's great.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   I mean, there's a few PCs around.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   A lot of the scientific monitoring software we use only works on PCs.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   Right.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   But now we're- several of us are dual booting in order to manage that.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   If you decide you want to put a computer down the slip and slide,
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   you can use the PCs.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   Please don't use the Mac.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   Too painful.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   So what's- you're just going to keep doing mythbusters for the rest of your life?
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Until they locked the door.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   It's an awfully great job.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   It must be.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.080]   Amazingly, the success was totally surprising of the show.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   We never set out to make something that was educational.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   If we had tried, we would have failed.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   We really are just following our nose.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   That was the motto of Seinfeld.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.080]   No teaching, no hugging.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   I love that.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.080]   And you know, you stay true to what the formula is,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   which is me and Jamie like dogs with a rope battling back and forth.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   But for the last six months, we've been the highest rated show on Discovery.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.080]   And seven years in, that's-
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.080]   Rightly so.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   Rightly so.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   The show is doing great.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   [ Applause ]
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.080]   We have more of a sense of ownership over the material than ever before.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   You know, we have this great brain trust in the middle of me and Jamie
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   and our director, Alice, and our executive producer, Dan Tapster.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   And the creative, that creative bond between the four of us is really satisfying for all of us.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   And we argue all the time.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   That's really unusual in mainstream media that you get that kind of-
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   Does Discovery never say let's not do that one?
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:45.080]   Because we've done so many tasteless things in relatively tasteful ways.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.080]   They give us a fairly free rate.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   That's great.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   There's not the stuff that they get upset about are things that they think are going to be boring.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   I've been pitching a audio file episode forever.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.080]   I want to do high-end speaker cable against my board.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   Yes.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   Yes.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   I want to prove-
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.080]   You don't have to be great.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   You don't have to be 50 bucks on a goddamn HDMI cable.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   I get them at mono price for $3, right?
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   Exactly.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   The green around the CDs, remember that?
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   Right.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   I actually concocted, I thought this was a great finale.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   Not only record versus CD, but versus MP3 at different compression rates,
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   and also in your car, in your house, and in his concert hall,
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   because all three of those are going to yield different results.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   They're all going to yield different levels of satisfaction to different people.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   I had my eyes open.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.080]   I was walking in San Francisco by Dolby Labs one day, and that guy kind of said,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   "Hey, Leo, come here."
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   And he pulled me- I'm not kidding.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   He pulled me into Dolby Labs.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   I never met this guy in my life.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.080]   He said, "I want to play you something."
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   And they have an anechoic chamber, a perfect sound studio in there
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   with rebel speakers, very high-end.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   You know, $100,000 speakers.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   And he said, "Okay, listen to this.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.080]   One of these is an MP3, and one of these is the CD,
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   and I could not tell the difference."
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   Could not tell.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.080]   Do you agree, Roger?
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   I mean, you record your stuff as MP3s.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   The artifacts in MP3.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   You can hear?
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   Yeah, I can hear some stuff.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   It's not as good a CD quality.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   I know when I record the stuff for the folktant, I do it at 48 kilohertz 24-bit,
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   and when it comes out as an MP3, it doesn't have the presence or the organ.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.080]   It's not as clear.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:26.080]   I saw a study that said that real music has an emotional component that is
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.080]   emotional component that's stripped out.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   See, I don't know how you'd measure that.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   Somebody crying when you would measure it.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   Every time I see these like $25,000 turntables, or the sandbags,
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   inventing some new way to describe gold coding.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   I think the audio business has been...
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Done in a vacuum with virgins.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   In unicorns tears, you always have to have the unicorn tears.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   It's so great to meet you, Adam, and thank you for your great success.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.080]   Thank you for being here today.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   We really appreciate it.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   Also, thank you for speaking out, like at the EFF forum, for freedom on the
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   Internet and in music to Roger.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   I mean, that's one common thread here today is freedom.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   Absolutely.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   Yup.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   Power to the people.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   Do you like rock 'n' roll?
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   Okay.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   So I wasn't sure...
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   I thought it was either you or Kiki that was going to be in the latex,
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   but I think it's Kiki stock hammer.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   So I want to bring Warp 11 out here.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   Warp 11 is a rock 'n' roll band.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   They're known as America's favorite sci-fi band.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   But Kiki, come on out, guys.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   Kiki stock hammer is the lead.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   Who they are, Warp 11?
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   You can stay there because they're going to stick to stand here.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   They're going to come from the way we can put it through.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   I think she's wearing the latex and all the camera, guys.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   This is a mild model of what he'll be wearing soon.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   And if you decide you don't want him anymore, you know, where you can go.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   Kiki, you are famous as a Demogoddus.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   I can remember so many times sitting and watching you with the Amiga and the video toaster.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Yes.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.080]   And doing that...
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   There was a Kiki wipe.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   There was, you know.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   At the time it freaked a lot of people out.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.080]   Carl, her husband is getting in the shot here.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   I was loving hate at the same time, but I tell you, all it took was going to a big giant Sony
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   party and all the head echelon of the Japanese.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   Oh, Kiki wipe.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   Kiki wipe.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   Well, the switcher we use for Twit is a Tri-caster, which is basically the grandson of that Amiga
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   video toaster for so many years.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.080]   Yeah, Tri-caster is basically the smallest live portable production device that rocks it.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.080]   It's really cool.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   It's really cool.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.080]   Do you want to tell us anything about anything about Warped Eleven before we begin?
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.080]   We play songs about Star Trek.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.080]   Really?
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   Yes, all you Star Wars fans?
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   You can get out.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   There's no songs about Jar Jar.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Jar Jar did ruin it for Wesley kind of ruined it, but Jar Jar really ruined a lot of things.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   Warped Eleven, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   This is a song about drinking and Star Trek, and it's called, yeah, did I mention that part?
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   Mostly about drinking and sex in Star Trek.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   It's called Red Alert.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   [Music]

[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.480]   They have to clear the hall
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.960]   so that the next event can go in.

[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.160]   So he doesn't have any CDs.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.560]   But I hope you will go over to,
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.680]   there's a music pavilion on the show floor there,

[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.240]   kinda go so that we can talk to you.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.040]   I'll be glad to hang around and talk to everybody
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.840]   and do that, but we're not allowed to do it
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.800]   out here or out in front.

[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.560]   She's amazing.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.400]   Colleen!
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.480]   You know, Colleen, you should come out here.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.800]   Come on out here, girl.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.040]   Colleen is our chief engineer.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.240]   She's way back there, I know,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.560]   but she's our chief engineer and she,
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.880]   is she coming out?
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.720]   Come on!

[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.960]   (audience cheering)
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.840]   She's our Sulu, or is it Chekhov?
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.640]   I can never remember.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.160]   But she built all the gear that makes fit possible.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.240]   (audience cheering)
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.640]   She's the greatest.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.320]   And you can thank her for the live stream.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.160]   Yeah, she is.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.520]   We're not worthy of Colleen.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.480]   And we're having a meetup at the Marriott Marquis
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.760]   at 5.30 to 8.30.
