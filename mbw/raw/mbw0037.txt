[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.180]   Kung Fu Grip.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:49.020]   A little late, but better late than ever.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.300]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.620]   The breakers are here.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.620]   Breaker Breaker, 1-9.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.540]   I have Scott Born on Channel 9.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.580]   Hello, rubber ducky.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.780]   Go ahead.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.460]   Hey, you got to smokey on your bandit, on your tail,
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.580]   on your pipe, and all that can is deathly.
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.620]   How's everybody doing?
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.940]   We should do this whole thing in CB lingo today.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.940]   Oh, please.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.020]   I'll pay you $100 if we don't have to.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.740]   I got a weasel of Womp Red in my side there.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.820]   The air, product windpipe, rumble, rumble.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.420]   That is, Merlin Man, the king of the Kung Fu Grip.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.780]   At KungFuGripee.com, g-r-i-p-p-e.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.980]   He spells it that way because he's French.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.220]   Maybe it's your ivory branded.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.420]   Yes, I won't lie to you.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.420]   KungFuGripee.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.140]   Now, how many-- you've got fives, which is the number 5ives.com.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.260]   You've got 43folders.com.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.060]   You've got the MerlinShow.com.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.220]   That's right.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.420]   And now you have KungFuGrip.com.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.100]   Yeah, that's a revival of an old web blog or blog
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.300]   that I had in the early part of the OTS.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.220]   You know, it's funny because I remember that blog,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.180]   and I love that blog, and I just didn't even know it was you.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.020]   Oh, you're just saying that.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.100]   No.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.860]   But you know, it's funny.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700]   I got to say, of all these funny little kind of web 2.0
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.620]   things you play with, we started playing with Tumblr.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.260]   You know, whatever.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.700]   Love Tumblr.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.900]   You introduced it to me, and I think it's so cool.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.340]   And you know what?
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460]   It's just so lightweight and fun, and you can just
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.780]   throw up a photo, and I'm really enjoying it.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.340]   And I think it seems like it's caught on--
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.620]   Scott Simpson, by the way, who is about the funniest man I
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.420]   know, has a fun one.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.860]   Oh, does he?
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.300]   Oh, I'll have to add it to my list.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.500]   But a lot of people, I've just noticed,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   it's kind of where a lot of people
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.780]   seem to be moving a lot of their--
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.260]   Scott's the iTunes guide app.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.340]   Well, one of the iTunes guys.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.700]   And a gentleman.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.460]   But you sort of talked about how you've got the very lightweight
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.300]   stuff you do with something like Twitter or Jai Koo.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.500]   You've got the kind of medium-weight stuff that you do
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.620]   with a tumble log.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.140]   And then you do a longer post, something like Vox type
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.580]   pad.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460]   That's what I do.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.380]   And you have a new site, BowlMover.com, which we don't know.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.620]   It's going to be some sort of web 2.0 meets the outhouse
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.180]   kind of thing.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.860]   Yeah, actually, I'm really glad you brought that up.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.620]   This is something where we're seeing a lot of dynamism
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.660]   around this space right now.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.460]   What I've done is I've gone and I went down to Sandhill
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.740]   and I really drilled down with some people.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.940]   And they feel like there's a few things
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.220]   that everyone has in common.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.780]   Net, net, fat part of the curve is going to come by being
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.180]   able to kind of monetize with what a lot of people would just
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.740]   consider leavings.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.380]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.060]   Did they open the kimono for you, Marn?
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.660]   Well, you know, just friendier, yes.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.220]   OK.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.460]   And so the sexy witches, I noticed also.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.220]   Oh, man.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.140]   That's sexy witches side.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.420]   I spent like half a day there.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.180]   But here's the thing, Merlin's decided that 43 folders isn't
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.660]   enough, so he's going for 43 blogs.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.540]   I think so.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.540]   I think so.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.140]   I think so.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.860]   And you make fun of me for having lots of blogs.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.740]   Well, I was going to say you're not exactly a lightweight
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.820]   in this field.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.300]   Well, I don't have as many as Merlin.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.620]   I got podcastingtricks.com, podcastgeargag.com,
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.020]   applephoneshow.com, iLifeZone.com, and then Padango.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.820]   Fine, that's it.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.660]   That was subtle, Scott.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.740]   You kind of just kind of subtly worked that in.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.980]   It's actually becoming a problem with some of people
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.500]   like the three of us.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.340]   I guess it's because it's so easy to do.
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.780]   As create a website, you just keep making them.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.820]   We need a master blog for our blogs.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.460]   Well, that's what Leoville has become for me.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.020]   It doesn't really have any content on its own.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.020]   And you radio is where you pull together all your podcasts?
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.900]   TechiLabs.com is the radio show.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.260]   Leoville.com is kind of the all-in-one.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.220]   I don't want to go on.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.580]   I think it's kind of neat that this is an amber.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.660]   How about just jumping us straight into a rat hole to start?
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.060]   But Amber asked me about this a long time ago.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.100]   Like, how can you talk to clients and stuff and have a site
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.180]   like Fives and have a site where you could have something
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.300]   like Balmover?
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.740]   And although the truth is, I kind of like that,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.140]   because then just the 43 folders productivity stuff
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.180]   goes on 43 folders for the most.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.260]   You can point people to the site that
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.180]   represents you in that space.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.420]   Yeah, I mean, you're right.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.300]   There's probably too many.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.700]   And it is kind of too easy in some ways to start a site.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.780]   But I do kind of like the way that there's lightweight tools
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.580]   for the different parts of your personality or life.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.580]   I think that's kind of cool.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.140]   I like those five things besides your ride
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.860]   that you might wish to pimp.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.260]   Your sideboard.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.500]   Your clergyman.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.740]   Your thoughts on transubstantiation.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.740]   Where do you come up with this stuff?
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.060]   Your hypothalamus or your ranch dressing mix?
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.740]   I'm pimping my ranch dressing mix right now.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.700]   There's your title.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.140]   Hey, what's going on in the world of Max this week, Lou?
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.700]   Well, Scott Bourne bought a quad.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.220]   And that was good news for all of us,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.500]   because the next day, Apple announced the 8-way Mac Pro.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.060]   Actually, Scott's not the only one who bought a quad.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.500]   I think it's safe to say I'm not.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.460]   No.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.420]   Other people we know bought quads.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.300]   It wasn't that I bought a quad.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.460]   It was that I bought a quad with you in tow.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.220]   Was it that me that triggered the whole thing?
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.700]   I think my--
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.500]   Well, it is called the Curse of Leo for a reason.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.300]   Boy, now it's spreading to my friends.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.300]   That's kind of bad.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.780]   This is an awkward moment where everyone in the Apple Store
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.820]   is pointing to tomorrow on the calendar
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.020]   and shaking their head now.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.540]   No, no.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.500]   But you know, you did the right thing,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.020]   because you just told me Pro Tools doesn't run on the 8-way.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.660]   Yeah, see, I really--
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.500]   by the way, it's nice to know you got friends.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.860]   Looking at the comments section on the blog,
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.380]   everybody knows lots of--
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.180]   There's lots of hahaha, Scott.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.060]   Well, here's the thing, oh, you hahaha,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.580]   are you?
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.500]   So the hahaha is on you, because actually, I
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.260]   bought this computer for a very specific reason.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.660]   It does only one thing in life.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.780]   It runs Pro Tools in my studio.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.460]   And if you call Digit Design down there in just south
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.380]   of San Francisco, you can ask them.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.460]   They'll tell you, it doesn't run on an octo.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.900]   And probably won't for a year.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.420]   So it wouldn't have done me any good at all.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.820]   However, the Curse of Leo effect
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.380]   did impact me slightly, because the 223-inch Apple
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.340]   Cinema displays I bought went down $100 in price the next day.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.180]   Now, they haven't announced new displays,
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.500]   but I would presume that the reason the price is going down
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.020]   is because they've gotten new displays in the works.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.420]   That's what the rumor is, of course.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.060]   Yeah, with more than likely an eyesight camera built in,
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.060]   once again, that's not going to impact me,
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.420]   because this system sits in my studio.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.980]   I have other computers for other things.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.900]   So do we--
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.420]   Do we move over this eight way?
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.100]   Is there any-- I mean, I don't really.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.300]   I mean, I've been--
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.540]   Alex-- well, Alex needs it.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.060]   Alex about it.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.220]   He's thrilled, because it's going to impact what he does.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.420]   But 99 out of 100 people you know
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.900]   don't even own a piece of software that'll take advantage of it.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.980]   I wasn't going to mention this, because I'm afraid even
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.460]   mentioning it on Leo's show will cause some kind
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.300]   of blowback in terms of a new one being released tomorrow.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.540]   But I, after waiting a very, very long time, bought a tower.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.740]   So I got a macro.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.260]   And I waited until after Scott had bought one.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.180]   And to say the truth, I didn't buy the Octo,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.020]   because I don't think I need it for what I do.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.820]   And my main thing is I was telling a friend,
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.220]   I kind of just wanted to make sure
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.140]   that there wasn't going to be a $500 super octo mini beer
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.660]   tap version that--
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.660]   And then mainly I was satisfied that, OK, the Octo,
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.180]   that sounds great.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.940]   There's no way I'm going to spend that kind of money, though.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.420]   Right.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.860]   Just it wouldn't monetize for me.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.140]   It wouldn't amortize in terms of the--
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.100]   I just said monetize.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.300]   It wouldn't pay back.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.220]   So what you're saying is the ROI isn't sufficient on the--
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.940]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.220]   I think really at the end of the day,
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.660]   when we look at what this thing is capable of.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.900]   There we go.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.380]   Let me ask you something, Scott.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.580]   Is there a reason-- do you like the Apple cinema displays
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.820]   over like I got a Dell?
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.500]   The Dell's are cheaper and they're better, I think.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.940]   And I'm just curious, though, because is it a--
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.100]   is it because they're pretty?
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.140]   I mean, I thought there was anything wrong with that.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   I just want to say, don't only tar Scott with his brush,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.940]   because I did the same thing about the Apple 30
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.540]   instead of the Dell 30, which was--
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.660]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.100]   Beautiful.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.980]   I've purchased probably more than a dozen of the cinematists
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.820]   plays for the various systems I have.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.500]   I just happen to like them, and maybe there is something better.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.140]   But I figure I can get the Apple care with it.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.780]   I can get it all at the same place.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.340]   My times were something.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.500]   No, it wasn't interesting.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.500]   I wasn't trying to criticize.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.940]   I was just curious, because-- and there
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.820]   are nice things about it.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.100]   Like you get that nice-- don't you
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.260]   have to get kind of a cool sort of all-in-one cable out
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.180]   the back that plugs straight in and everything?
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.860]   That's kind of cool.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.420]   You get a built-in firewire and USB hub
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.620]   as part of the deal.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.220]   And there's no getting around the fact
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.820]   that they're gorgeous displays.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.500]   Now, with the price coming down to the point that it is now,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.460]   I have to say, I probably-- even if there was a competing
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.220]   product that I liked, it would lean me even harder
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.260]   towards getting the Apple, because it's just nice to have
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.980]   everything match.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.020]   And two of these 23-inch cinematists,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.020]   place side by side, looked awfully nice sitting
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.300]   over my console running Pro Tools.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.580]   One thing the Dell has, though, is a lot more connectors,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.700]   including a HDMI connector in.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.820]   And if you were going to buy one big screen display
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.660]   and want to use it as a TV and a computer,
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.700]   it would be a better choice.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.300]   My friend-- I was inspired-- my friend, Mike Montero,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.500]   over at Mule Design inspired me to get this,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.780]   because I just saw his.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.540]   And I was like, wow, you can plug in--
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.900]   let me look.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.980]   Compact Flash.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.420]   You can plug in--
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.260]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.060]   --like the SD cards, like little camera parts.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.180]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.660]   It's not as pretty-- also it flips around.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.420]   It does that totally--
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.940]   What is that?
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.340]   --early '90s vertical mode.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.460]   So what display did you get?
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.820]   What display did you get, Marilyn?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.660]   Oh, I've had this one for a little while.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.300]   It's not the ginormous one.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.460]   It's the 2023.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.340]   Is that right?
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.420]   It's not the crazy piece.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.860]   The cinema.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.820]   It's not the EV Williams-sized one.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.900]   It's the--
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.540]   First time I ever saw a 30 was at Ev's house,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.380]   and I just couldn't even stop looking at it for an hour.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.300]   It's funny you get used to it, and then it's just--
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.580]   well, it's just another display.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.420]   Really?
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.220]   You get--
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.260]   I have two 30s at home, but I couldn't fit them in my studio.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.060]   So I went to 23s, and frankly, now that I'm using the 23s,
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.180]   I think I like them better.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.300]   They're wide, which is kind of nice.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.100]   I got a Dell 23 for the Dell we use,
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.020]   and I have to say it's a beautiful monitor.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.980]   It's a-- or what 24, I guess.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.220]   But anyway, I mean, there's nothing wrong with buying Apple.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.860]   We've got to keep Steve--
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.460]   Oh, God, no, not at all.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.980]   But I do want to make my friend Derek's story happy,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.500]   because every single Apple computer I've ever bought,
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.540]   I bought maxed out RAM at the Apple store,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.940]   and he always chides me.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.740]   What you doing?
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.500]   You can get it to me anywhere.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:42.900]   You know, this time--
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.980]   Anywhere.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.340]   This time I didn't do that.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.740]   Oh, you're going to buy your RAM somewhere else?
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.180]   I went to dealram.com, and this is not my pick of the week,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.180]   but it could be, because dealram.com has made a site
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.020]   that lets you see all the great RAM prices.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.220]   And it's just literally--
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.660]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   If you're a RAM--
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.740]   They don't sell themselves.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.100]   They--
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.580]   No.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.100]   No.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.580]   No.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.100]   That's a good--
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.620]   But if you're a--
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.460]   Apple care, if you buy outside--
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.340]   No, as long as you have at least one gig of Apple RAM.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.860]   Oh, OK.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.940]   And I have two gigs of Apple RAM, so I'm cool.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.060]   So the other 14 gigs are from--
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.540]   What?
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.100]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.100]   Say that again.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.380]   How many?
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.020]   The other 14 gigs are from Micron.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.940]   You have a 16 gig machine.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.700]   That's all I would let me put in.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.180]   That's a lot of RAMs, right?
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.740]   I'm running Pro Tools, Leo.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.580]   Does it use all 16 gigs?
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.420]   Pro Tools, Will.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.620]   Another reason not to use Pro Tools.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.100]   Holy cow.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.100]   So--
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.980]   You don't need that, but I added it.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.060]   Speaking of a bloatware, John Foster put up a link saying
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.300]   that the Apple Creative Suite--
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.220]   I'm sorry, Adobe Creative Suite 3 for web and production
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.180]   is absolutely huge and bloated.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.500]   And Dreamweaver CS3 is bad, InDesign CS3 is a disappointment.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.180]   It sounds like this is a review from ITinquire.com.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.580]   It sounds like there are some rumblings in the Adobe camp.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.780]   People are unhappy about the new CS3.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.900]   Have you heard anything?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.980]   No, I haven't heard much.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.340]   It hasn't been out for very long.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.860]   But the main thing I heard was just the chatter
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.620]   that I hear is people saying, gosh, it's kind of a little bit,
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.820]   I don't know, weirdly PC, Microsoft
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.020]   like to have all these bizarre combinations of things.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.780]   It seems just confusing to some consumer people.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.780]   For people who are enterprise buyers, I said enterprise.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.700]   You just said that, Mo, you know why he was just consulting?
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.900]   He was consulting for the last two days, and he's kind of in that mode now.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.980]   And so that's all I've heard about it.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.660]   No, this is interesting.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.460]   I'm just looking at this article now that, huh, I hope they sped up Dreamweaver.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.460]   Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.380]   It's just been-- it's part of the problem
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.060]   is this being a program that goes so far back in Adobe's commitment
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.780]   to try to keep everything backwards compatible.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.300]   There's no doubt that the code is going to have to be spaghettied all over the place
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.580]   so that you can still open a Photoshop one document.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.460]   I mean, Thomas Knowles said publicly way back when, you know,
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.460]   well, you'll always be able to open your Photoshop documents.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.860]   And I think they're trying to stick to that, but it's got to be--
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.380]   Right.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.380]   It's got to have a heavy cost.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.500]   It has to have a very heavy cost on the programming side.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.620]   Right.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.940]   Does anybody still use Dreamweaver, Merlin, or--
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.220]   I mean, that's kind of old school to do static pages in Dreamweaver,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.380]   although now they have this spry framework for Ajax-y stuff.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.140]   Well, it's a funny thing.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.500]   I still actually-- excuse me.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.340]   And I still kind of maintain a few sites in using the Dreamweaver sites tool
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.620]   just because I was too lazy to ever do PHP includes four of them.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.020]   But it is-- I mean, one thing it is nice about it-- and this goes all the way back
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.260]   to those products, kind of like, you know, like Go Live and stuff like that.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.500]   It does make it-- for people who are-- who have pretty modest technical skills,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.980]   it makes it pretty easy to administer a large site with common features.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.780]   But you're right.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.860]   I mean, a lot's changed.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.820]   It's got old school web design.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.340]   It is.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.660]   And so much has changed.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.340]   I mean, I think about-- we've talked about this before,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.220]   but I think about when I was first getting started in the web stuff
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.380]   and everybody was cutting stuff up in Photoshop and opening it in ImageReady
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.180]   and outputting all those GIFs and spacers and standard space design
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.660]   and the ubiquity of lamp as a way to run all your stuff has--
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:15.300]   I think that's really put a dent, as I would imagine, into stuff like Dreamweaver.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:15.900]   But--
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.740]   Do you use it?
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.020]   It might be good for a CSS tool.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.220]   You know what I like it for is--
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:22.900]   this is weird.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.340]   I think I can do this in BB Edit, but I kind of forget how.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.900]   I like that you can just drop in a big chunk of text.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.820]   And then it makes it very easy to kind of grab.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.140]   So grab the table that's surrounding where the cursor is right now.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.140]   And it'll grab all the HTML around that.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.420]   It has nice little tools like that.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.140]   Yeah, that's handy.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.620]   It feels a little slow to me.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.660]   And then there's stuff like, is it like, Skedit?
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.020]   And there's like all these kind of like, you know, shareware apps out there
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.980]   that are, you know, making pretty good strides.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.780]   But you're right.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.180]   Wizziwigs just aren't where they were in 1997, you know, page mail and stuff like that.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.100]   Right, right.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:00.380]   Aperture, you'll be glad to know, has a new free trial, or at least that seems to be
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.100]   with the case according to this website.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.700]   Is this new?
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.060]   The free trial for Aperture.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.980]   The trial's been out for a while.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.340]   Oh, well, why does-- OK, somebody just put this on here.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.220]   Snuck that in.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.220]   Troy.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.260]   It wasn't me, by the way.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.220]   It's not new, Troy.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.900]   OK.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.820]   Troy also gave us the Mac OS X kernel panic screen saver.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.980]   It looks like trouble.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.980]   From the unofficial Apple wed log, just in time for, well, too late for April fools.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.100]   But it still would be kind of cool to have lying around.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.340]   You never know.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.180]   Here's an interesting rumor.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.180]   This is from Mac News Network, MacNN.com.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:40.420]   Apple considering subscriptions on iTunes, according to the intent media works research
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.900]   group, discussions with Apple staffers have led the company CEO to believe that the iTunes
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.500]   store will see a subscription service within six months.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.580]   Hey, this is Satan calling.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.580]   I'm pretty ticked about hell being frozen over down here.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.940]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.860]   I love the fact that it's the main reason to get a zone.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.580]   There were any reason it would be because of the subscriptions.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.740]   I'll tell you why.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.980]   You get-- and this was kind of an eye-opener for me.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   I had a Zoom.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.140]   I obviously had nothing that would play on the Zoom because all my stuff is from iTunes.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.420]   Or, you know, or even if I bought stuff on Microsoft's site, I couldn't play it on the
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   Zoom.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.620]   But for a subscription, $15 a month, you could look at anything, drag it over, and it's there.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.380]   So you fill your Zoom up like that.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.340]   Basically, for one low, flat, monthly rate, the subscription model works so well.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.060]   It doesn't seem like something Apple would want to do.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.620]   They've had such success.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.980]   This is what Alex has been ad nauseam requesting for forever.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.220]   And we talked before about stuff like Rhapsody and how well that is.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.860]   But I wonder what that would look like.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.820]   What do you think that looks like on the iTunes store?
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.980]   Do you think it's its own little area?
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:54.060]   I think they're talking about it being a separate, almost like a parallel iTunes experience.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   Yeah, that's how Microsoft's doing it essentially.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.860]   You can do it the old way or the new way.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.900]   I haven't thought much about it just in the two minutes that you've been talking about
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.900]   it.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.660]   I can't envision it personally.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.780]   I have to admit, I would probably do it.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.780]   I would totally do it.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.580]   I would do it in a heartbeat.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.420]   That gives you a chance to experiment with some music that you might not be willing to
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.780]   buy otherwise.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.020]   One in four teenagers say they'd pay $500 for an iPhone.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.220]   What did three and four say?
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.220]   No.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.380]   Three and four said they wouldn't.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.660]   But that's the way that's basically how Scott is spinning this story.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   One of it.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.660]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.660]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.300]   If you knew the size of that market, you would understand why Piper Jaffrey says $200 is a
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.740]   target price for Apple stock.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.420]   Because these teenagers, not only said they'd buy it, but they said they'd pay $500 for
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   it.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.580]   And if one in four teenagers, that is a huge market.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.900]   If one in four did that, the numbers that Mr. Jobs quoted at the keynote are quite a
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.740]   bit lower than what they'll actually be.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.580]   And I do want to make the disclaimer.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.900]   I am an Apple-incorporated stockholder, but I'm telling you, with Piper Jaffrey, not exactly
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.020]   a liberal group coming out and saying that $200 is not an unreasonable target price for
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.180]   this stock, you got to ask yourself, where's that coming from?
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.020]   Well, I don't ever look at the news reports to find that out.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.620]   I actually read the documents from the analyst.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:27.060]   And one of the things that they were talking about is this story.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.980]   Is it one in four teenagers would spend dads $500 on the iPhone?
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.220]   Well, obviously, since one in four teenagers are unlikely to have that much money of their
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   own.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.220]   It's an easy thing to say.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.220]   Well, would you spend somebody else's money?
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.220]   Well, what percentage of your kids would spend your money on that?
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.420]   50% of my children would spend dads' money on my phones.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420]   Sure.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   Why not?
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   I think actually it might be 100%.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.180]   Henry just has an event in interest.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.540]   But my daughter, my 15-year-old, is absolutely adamant.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.700]   She's got a junk-yill beat-up phone.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   She wants to get rid of it.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.700]   She won't.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.940]   She won't let me buy her phone until June.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.940]   Guess why?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.940]   Wow.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.580]   Can I have her as a guest on the Apple phone show?
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.580]   Yeah, sure.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.340]   She's totally expecting me to get her an iPhone.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.380]   One little problem, we're Verizon customers for the family system.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.380]   So I don't know what.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.980]   I do have a singular account for a review.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.980]   But I pay for a singular account so I can review singular phones.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.020]   One suggestion, Leo, just because I know you care a lot about your family.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.100]   If you don't want to break your daughter's heart, if Scott promises to buy her a phone,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.100]   that's how we go.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   Oh, here we go.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.900]   Don't believe that because he'll come up with a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.020]   And legally, he's on now a guest after.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.860]   I should come up with something like that.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.700]   I'll tell you.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.780]   We're not far off now, a couple of months off now.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.900]   June 11th is what people are saying.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.340]   I think that that could be wrong.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.940]   But that's a date that seems to now be floating around June 11th.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.380]   Just to give that, lend that some credence, I just plunked 750 smackers down to buy the
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.980]   new Nokia N95.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980]   Whoa.
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980]   There you go.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.180]   I guess there's no iPhone in my future.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.300]   But wait a minute, I thought that the iPhone was the most expensive cell phone ever.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.500]   That's what I've seen on many blog posts.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.900]   How could you possibly spend some?
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.300]   Well, it's unsubsidized.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.540]   It's an unlocked phone, so it would be cheaper if we're subsidized.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.940]   But I like the unlocked phones.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.380]   I'm really liking what Nokia's doing.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.180]   I've always liked Symbian.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.460]   This new one has 640 by 40, 30-frame video.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.460]   It's got a 5-2-minute-2-man.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.260]   So what are you going to do if you fall in love with the iPhone?
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.340]   I'll get it from my daughter, I guess.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.340]   OK.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.660]   No, where do you see this?
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.020]   Where do you see this N95?
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.020]   You might change your tune.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.820]   Does it sync to a Mac?
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.020]   Beautifully.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.180]   I can't get the site to load on Safari, which is not a good sign.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.140]   No, no, it works very well.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.020]   It has a beautiful browser where it's Flash built into it.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.140]   That's a lot of money.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.940]   It is a little-- it's a computer.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.740]   It's a 5 megapixel camera.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.940]   It's a video camera.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.020]   It's like that with a--
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.380]   Oh, GPS built in.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.180]   It's a slicer.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.740]   It's a dicer.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740]   It's got GPS built.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   It's not part of what else does it do.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.980]   And for $10 a month, you get turned by turn signals.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.900]   But it has maps, world-mind maps, and GPS.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.660]   When I take a picture on and upload it to Flickr,
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.900]   it will automatically upload the GPS coordinates.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.220]   I mean, there's some neat stuff to it.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.900]   Which--
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.820]   Does it only work with Verizon?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.500]   No, no, it's a GSM, unlocked GSM.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.340]   So it works with T-Mobile and Singular.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.700]   That's probably a good investment.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.460]   Yeah, if you're spending that on an unlock phone,
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.420]   see what Sprint.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.500]   Sprint has like a 700p that you can buy out
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.980]   right for like $699.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.300]   Yeah, phone is expensive if they're on--
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.340]   They've got all this like really Byzantine rules
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.020]   about which discounts you get and how long you've
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.540]   been with them and so on.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.580]   I like unlocked.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.820]   I'm a fan of unlocked.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.940]   And I've become a fan--
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.740]   I got a loner of the Nokia N93 from Vox.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.700]   And I become a fan of these Nokia phones.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.740]   I've always liked Symbian.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.820]   And I just think they're really--
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.540]   I think they're really nice.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.580]   And it supports Jai-Koo because it has this Jai-Koo
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.580]   presence built into it.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.740]   So I, you know--
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.300]   Maybe I'll go test one of those out.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.380]   I'll tell you what, I'll show you.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.300]   And you could take a look.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.980]   And then you know what we could do a head-to-head
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.780]   comparison with the iPhone.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.500]   Because you know, while I'm obviously somewhat excited
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.540]   about getting an iPhone, if it ends up sucking,
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.780]   I'm still going to need another phone.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.940]   There you go.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.420]   Wow, I've never heard the possibility of equivocation
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.660]   on the iPhone matter from you.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.860]   I'm getting this guy.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.460]   I'm getting this guy.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.660]   Here's the thing.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.060]   I just wanted to do something to balance the misperception
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.500]   that I'm going to say it's good if it's not because I'm not.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.700]   No, that's right.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.380]   If it sucks, I'm going to say it sucks.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.220]   But I'm anticipating that it'll be like all the other Apple
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.020]   products I enjoy and it won't.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.660]   Like God.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.140]   OK.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.700]   So you wanted to suck, don't you, Merlin?
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.500]   I don't want to.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.140]   I have a question.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.660]   I have a question.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.140]   There are a lot of people who wanted to suck, though.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.860]   Or sitting there waiting for Apple to fall into space.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.260]   Oh, God.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.260]   There's a lot of people.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:43.460]   Let's--
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.060]   --voract.blogspot.com or whatever.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.540]   What phones are out there that will sync contacts easily
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.380]   with a Mac?
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.140]   I mean, the trio--
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.340]   The Symbian works beautifully.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:55.660]   Really.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.380]   And with a trio, I do that with Missing Sync.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:57.900]   And--
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.820]   OK, now stop right there.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.500]   I do it via Bluetooth with my Nokia.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.860]   Only person on the planet I know, Merlin, that can make Missing Sync
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.380]   work the trio phone with a Mac.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:05.700]   So let's just--
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.260]   Don't jinx me.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.180]   I have had no problems ever with that.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.060]   I've never--
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.500]   --six trios trying to do that with no luck.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.060]   Wow.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.340]   I've been very happy with the--
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.620]   I believe her and how that uses iSync.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.060]   And it does it via Bluetooth.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.940]   It does it very quickly.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.100]   It does it very effectively.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.900]   It does iCal.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.380]   It does the contacts.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.020]   And so the--
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.580]   --is the phone you just bought, Leo?
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.620]   Yeah, well, no, this is the N93, which I've had.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.380]   I just upgraded the N93 to the 93i, which is working beautifully.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.820]   But I'm waiting for the '95.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.940]   I bought the-- the '93 was a good experience for me.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.540]   The '93 looks like a camcorder.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.380]   It's kind of a funky, weird phone.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.780]   The '95 is a little smaller.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.300]   It's got a slider interface.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   You've got as many cell phones as Merlin has blocks.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.380]   You know, it's a business--
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:48.860]   I know.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.060]   And it's a business--
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.340]   unfortunately, it's kind of a hazard of doing the radio show.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.580]   One of the topics that is most popular,
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.900]   kind of in the mainstream gadget, arena, is cell phones.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.020]   Because that's what that's the computer most people have.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.620]   A billion cell phones a year are sold.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.620]   I mean, that's much more popular than the PC.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.020]   So that's what people want to know about.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.380]   So lately-- and I don't really enjoy it.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.820]   I don't start to enjoy it, actually.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.620]   But lately, I've had to become a cell phone whiz.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.500]   It's been a lot of time on cell phones.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.180]   This is pretty.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.340]   So it's got a little sideways, slidey, outy thing.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.900]   Wow, that's really cool.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.540]   And it's got a little--
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.460]   Can I buy one at the Verizon store?
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.980]   No, it doesn't work with Verizon.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.380]   It's GSM.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.140]   Oh, it won't work with Verizon.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.140]   That's right.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.700]   GSM's a little hard thing you put in.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.620]   Yeah, it's the same card.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.860]   You have to have-- but that's what-- see,
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.780]   unlocked phones basically are for GSM,
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.700]   because you have to be able to take your card
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.380]   and put it in the new phone.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.140]   So will it work on singular then?
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.820]   It will.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.940]   It will, unfortunately.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.820]   And this is a sad thing.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.940]   It supports HSDPA, the new very high speed.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.820]   Much better, the third generation network.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.500]   And singular has HSDPA in San Francisco.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.340]   It's a different frequency than the N95.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.140]   Oh, it will not support singular's USHDPA.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.820]   I know, that's a shame.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.260]   Well, that's it.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.620]   I'm not buying it then.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.820]   That's his edge.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.500]   But it does Wi-Fi, and you could put a SIP phone on it.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.620]   In fact, there's a site you might want to check out called
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.380]   Fring.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.380]   I wouldn't.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.660]   It sounds like Fring.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.180]   I need a Fring.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.380]   Fring, fly even.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.020]   Haven.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.420]   That Fring and phone.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.380]   Fring is a mobile VoIP application
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.620]   for cellular handsets that will interface with your Skype
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.020]   or Gizmo or whatever you use.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.060]   And it works on the Nokia phones.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.220]   And it says it will work with 3G networks
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.620]   as well as the Wi-Fi networks.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.380]   That's that I'd like to see.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.580]   We'll have a shoot out.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.060]   As long as we're pimping sites, I
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.460]   like to pimp a site my friend Eric does called Phone Scoop.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.300]   Have you ever been there?
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.260]   No.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:43.660]   It's really cool.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.980]   Phone Scoop.com.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.580]   Anytime I want to go learn about phones, that's where I go.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.660]   It's a really terrific site for just catching up on the latest
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.180]   stuff.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.020]   It's got a little community stuff with reviews.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.820]   And adding it to my bookmarks is just--
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.700]   If you're in the market for--
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.020]   and the thing is if you're like me,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.420]   and this just makes your eyes glaze over to hear all these--
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:00.940]   I know.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.860]   It's very hard.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.940]   It's a good way to go in.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.220]   And even phones that are brand new,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.420]   he'll have a sneak preview sometime.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.780]   So yeah, Phone Scoop.com.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.820]   Our friend, Rail, used to do a mobile whack.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.660]   I guess he sold that.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.420]   But that was a great site for the same thing.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.300]   I loved mobile whack.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.860]   But Phone Scoop--
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.420]   That was Rail?
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.060]   Rail did that?
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.180]   God, he's such a Renaissance man.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.100]   He is, isn't he?
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.100]   He is.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.700]   But I think he-- I understand he sold it.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.460]   Yeah, the Phone Scoop has a good review of the N95.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.940]   And speaking of pimping and speaking of Rail--
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.140]   Quick-it-stick-it.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.380]   Quick-it-it-silver-stick-it.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.300]   Quick-it-stick-it.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   I'm downloading it right now.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.100]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.740]   Disclosure, I am on the advisory board for Stick-it,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.180]   but that doesn't change the fact that it's an awesome web app.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   Oh, a web ticket.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.580]   Quick-silver, everybody's favorite application launcher
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.700]   and manipulation tool, has just come out
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.380]   with a really cool--
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.780]   Did it come from Quick-silver from Stick-it?
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.420]   It came from Alcor.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.220]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.380]   So Alcor uses Stick-it.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.260]   I begged him to go make it.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.100]   Oh, it came from you?
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.740]   Is it a game for--
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.580]   Well, indirectly.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.300]   No, I mean, I just said, he loves the challenge
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.420]   of coming up with something that'll
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.820]   make the best use of whatever he has access to,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.180]   in terms of an API.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.460]   So it's really cool.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.540]   My favorite thing-- I had this on 43 folders today.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.380]   My favorite thing is you can set up a proxy trigger
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.180]   where you can basically select a string of text
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.860]   and hit one key, and it'll create a silently
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.180]   create a stick-it based on whatever you selected.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.660]   Oh!
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.740]   You can also edit your stick-its right inside a quick-silver.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.380]   So instead of Google Notebook, I could use Stick-it
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.380]   to paste all my stuff into.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.740]   You could-- I mean, again, there's
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.660]   so many of these kinds of tools.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.740]   I'm not saying go cancel everything, go cancel your backpack.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.980]   But it's kind of a nice--
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.300]   yeah, I mean, to me, this kind of changes things.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.100]   If really, with the API for Stick-it's pretty powerful.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.580]   And I think this is a good example of what you can do
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.700]   with that kind of access.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.780]   Cool.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.540]   So yeah.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.420]   Anyway, close pimping tag.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.180]   100 million iPods sold.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.980]   It only took them five and a half years
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.380]   making it the fastest selling music player in history,
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.820]   faster than the Walkman, faster than the Rio.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.700]   Five is-- November 2001, and they've now sold--
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.260]   is 100 millions a significant landmark, I would say.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.140]   Yeah, and there's still people out there saying, yeah,
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.460]   that iPod thing's never going to go anywhere.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.660]   What-- here's the question.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.020]   Is anything-- what-- something, eventually,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.140]   will replace the iPod.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.780]   But what's it going to be?
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.860]   iPhone.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.620]   Yeah, it might be.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.540]   No.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.420]   You know what's-- that's a good question, Lea, because I think
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.700]   one thing we kind of see this oscillating between two poles.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.540]   You know, we see this with every kind of technology.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.140]   Do we want a really like a Swiss army knife all in one?
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.820]   Or do we want like the best of breed,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.100]   Unix-y kind of single purpose tool?
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.020]   And I don't know.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.460]   I don't know what that-- what that looks like.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.300]   I mean, one thing that's interesting about the iPod
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.420]   is as much as people come up with these cute little hacks,
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.460]   you can put Wikipedia on your iPod and stuff like that.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.900]   It's not-- yeah, Scott's kind of right, I think.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.460]   I mean, the iPod is pretty much a music and video player.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.900]   You know, I think it would be interesting to see what happens
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.580]   next with the technology if you can come up with someone
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.500]   that's even smaller.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.740]   Now, we should say it's the fastest-selling music player
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.260]   in history, but not the best-selling.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.060]   The Walkman actually has moved 350 million units.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.220]   The Walkman family.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.980]   The family.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   What does that include?
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.820]   Which shows you that--
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.420]   Just cassettes?
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.540]   Just cassettes or something like that.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.860]   No, I'm sure it's the whole product line.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.300]   Well, that's not fair.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.140]   But that goes back to 1980 something.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.980]   Yeah, 1979.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.420]   Right.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.900]   I mean, no, I think you could pretty much
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.260]   say the iPod has supplanted the Walkman.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.580]   I guess my point is that the Walkman isn't what it used to be.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.820]   It eventually got supplanted.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.740]   Right, right.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.380]   Well, clearly, you know, holographic technologies
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.820]   that are being worked on right now--
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.220]   The One Apple be right there.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.300]   I mean--
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.420]   Yeah, and what-- but you know, if it
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.980]   will fit within the confines of an iPod, they'll use it.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.100]   But it could be that they'll supplant something else.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.220]   Merlin has said it.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   Alex has said it.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.980]   You've said it, Leo.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.780]   I've said it.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.460]   It's not about the iPod.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.740]   It's about iTunes.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.220]   Well, that's the reason the iPod sells.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.100]   It's about the environment, the ecology, the iTunes system.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.540]   But you know, it's not just the anti--
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.140]   I don't want to say anti-apple people,
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.700]   because they have every right to dislike Apple.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.740]   But it's not just those people, though.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.620]   They're kind of waiting for the other shoe to fall.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.260]   I got to say, I'm kind of myself surprised
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.380]   that they haven't--
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.020]   I don't know.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.020]   Anybody who lived through the mid '90s
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.500]   kind of has to wonder about some of that Apple DNA still
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.140]   being around.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.860]   But they seem to-- I don't know how they keep coming up
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.140]   with winners like this.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.620]   Well, we'll see if the iPhone is a winner.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   But the iPod certainly is a success.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.620]   Did you see the Apple TV commercial that--
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.220]   And we can talk about that.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.980]   Yeah, it was a good commercial, featuring School of Rock.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.100]   But I mean, they nailed it in there.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.900]   And I'll certainly mangle this quote.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.180]   But it's something like, you know, it's your music.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.020]   It's on your computer.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.780]   It's on your iPod.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.380]   It's your stuff.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.100]   And now it's on your TV.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.500]   And I think it's-- once again, they
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.860]   seem to be making these concentric circles in kind
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.940]   of smart ways out around iTunes and around the Mac.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.380]   And I mean, like today, the first thing I did when I got my tower
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.140]   set up was to go do the N enabler.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.940]   And I set up a separate N network.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.460]   And I'm not doing sync anymore on my Apple TV.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.100]   I'm just doing straight streaming.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.580]   You're not having any buffering issues.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.980]   I'm having major buffering issues.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.540]   But I think it's because the main computer is not an N
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.540]   computer.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.660]   And to be fair, I haven't watched-- I haven't set and watched
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.620]   all heroes or anything.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.180]   But I pulled up-- I was very quickly
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.740]   pulling a video podcast off my tower.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.460]   I have major buffering issues.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.580]   But I think--
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.220]   Do you ever lose the connection?
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.580]   I sometimes--
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   All the time.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.780]   See, that makes me crazy.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.380]   I keep-- I don't know if it's a lease problem?
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.500]   Yeah, I think it's the 802.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.340]   It's Wi-Fi.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.500]   But I wonder if it's a DHCP lease issue.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:34.700]   Is this--
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:34.700]   Is this--
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:34.700]   Is this--
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.220]   Is this--
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.220]   Is this--
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.720]   --expiring?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.220]   Or something.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   Because I just--
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   Why does that just--
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.220]   And if you're in a crowded neighborhood as you are,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.420]   I'm sure there's lots of Wi-Fi base stations
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.460]   in your neighborhood.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.100]   Well, not in the sunset.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.220]   But my hack for that is to just go in and tell it
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.340]   act like you want to go look for a new iTunes.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.100]   And the numbers come up.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.300]   And that, for some reason--
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.500]   And then menu out of that.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.340]   And for some reason, that seems to help it refined.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.300]   It's good enough.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.380]   And there actually, as I found today,
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.820]   there's a pretty good helper doc on the Apple site
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.580]   if you're having trouble getting hooked up.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.060]   This is why I'm waiting for 2.0.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.180]   Yeah, but I got to tell you, Scott,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.580]   it's pretty polished.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.380]   I mean, it's-- and just to be a completely be to dead horse,
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.420]   the funny thing is the best looking content on there
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.540]   is podcasts right now.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.980]   Oh, listen, I'm excited about all that.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.940]   I think that is what's the cool thing about it.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.180]   But I don't want to wait--
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.620]   I don't want to have all these problems.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.380]   I just want it to work.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.020]   So I'm going to wait for--
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.380]   Well, I mean, you can also--
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.140]   Your points will take.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.540]   And you can also do things like hook up.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.100]   I think I'm very close to being ready to try some
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.060]   of the surgery.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.740]   Because at this point, I've waited.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.380]   And it looks like nothing's blown up yet.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.380]   So I think I'm ready to try some of that.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.660]   You're going to do the hack?
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.700]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.620]   Has anybody come up with a way to do X-Vid
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.260]   that doesn't involve pulling the dog out?
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.380]   You know, I'm surprised.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.540]   When we did that Mac break, which, by the way, probably--
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.340]   that's why Alex is probably not here.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.020]   I'm sure he's working on that right now.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.100]   I hope he's working on throwing it away.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.540]   But when we did that Mac break, that was one of the things
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.380]   I thought I predicted at the time,
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.020]   was that these hacks where you have to take the thing apart
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.340]   would be quickly supplanted by a hack to an external drive
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.020]   that you boo from.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.100]   And I haven't seen that.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.620]   I'm actually surprised.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.020]   Well, yeah, that's right.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.060]   And we thought that the USB service port
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.620]   was going to end up being the key to everything.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.020]   But the thing is, at the heart of it,
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.940]   if I understand this correctly-- and I could be wrong--
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.140]   but at the heart of it, what you're doing
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.780]   when you pull the drive is installing basically a little door
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.020]   that lets you come in via Unix.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.100]   And once you can do that--
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.100]   You don't do anything you want.
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.980]   And incidentally, Apple has said, we don't have a back door.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.180]   We don't plan to disable these features effectively,
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.540]   given people permission to go ahead
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.700]   and hack the Apple TV, which is great news.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.700]   And that's what I find really interesting,
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.340]   because that just seems counterintuitive, the Apple culture.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.420]   But maybe they're learning.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.260]   Well, especially for them to--
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.660]   I could see in private them thinking that.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.420]   But to say it in public is you're right.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.260]   It's very surprising.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.100]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.500]   Next thing you know, they'll actually
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.820]   be talking about products before they release.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.220]   No, never.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:00.820]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.460]   Didn't they do that with the Apple TV?
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:02.820]   Maybe--
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.140]   They kind of did, exactly.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.500]   I mean, that's why I'm saying, I got this call from Satan.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.140]   He goes, hell, it was really cool.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.060]   We've got no DRM on music.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.460]   We've got some kind of scheme where you can download the music
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.460]   and not have to pay for it.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.700]   Now we're talking about products before they release.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.620]   Heck, I mean, they're going to relocate international falls
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.300]   Minnesota to hell.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.780]   The world is changing very rapidly,
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.820]   and it's making me extremely uncomfortable.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.140]   Maybe we could do a little bit of what most of us
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.860]   are terrible at, which is a little bit of the predicting
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.540]   the future stuff.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.660]   So we've just gotten a big rev-- not a big rev.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   I got a pretty big deal.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.980]   The Octo's coming out.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   So what hardware do we see coming out in the near future
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   as we're coming up next?
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.300]   UIMAC.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.980]   Yeah, well, they're due, but what would they do differently?
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.300]   They're very due.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.100]   I think we're going to see the interface, the iPhone interface
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.740]   on the UIMAC.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.860]   We're going to see pinch.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.580]   Here's what I predict.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.980]   Everything is waiting on Leopard.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.820]   Well, that's for sure.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.780]   And waiting.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.780]   And waiting.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.340]   And waiting.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.300]   But we'll see Leopard.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.460]   Don't you think we'll see it at WWDC in June?
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.260]   And when that happens--
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.100]   We better.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.500]   That's when you're going to see it.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.000]   Really?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.740]   You don't think so?
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.540]   What do you know?
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.580]   Tell us what you know.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.820]   I don't know much, but I hear things.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.500]   I don't know much, but what I know is--
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.100]   Well, I mean, you know how the funny thing about software,
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.740]   if I could talk out of my butt for a minute,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.020]   the funny thing about software is it's a really weird curve.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.500]   You're watching something, and it just
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.820]   looks like a bunch of rafters with no walls.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.380]   And then you turn away, and the next minute
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.020]   you look, and it's a beautiful mansion.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.500]   So I mean, the software does not work on the kind of curve,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   like building a bridge.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.900]   Having said that, what I hear from a lot of different folks--
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.060]   this is not one person, this is not three people--
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.220]   is that it's not--
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.220]   whenever you say stuff like June, they're kind of like, oh,
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.500]   well, maybe.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.620]   In other words, it's kind of far off.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.700]   I guess people are saying it maybe--
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.140]   It's not quite ready.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.900]   So what are we going to talk about at WWDC?
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.660]   We're going to say, hey, remember that thing we talked
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.980]   about at last, WWDC?
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.740]   We're still working on it.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.500]   Well, maybe they can--
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   Well, the developers have--
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.980]   Well, please, if you're in the ADC,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.060]   you get a release of this.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.740]   So you can load that up and be testing your software.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.900]   It's not like developers are starving for that.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.420]   Those updates are coming out.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   But as far as having it--
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.020]   so you guys think, do you think there
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.060]   are products that are hanging on--
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.700]   Well, we know the iLife Suite is.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.300]   The iLife Suite's completely hanging on it,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.980]   because remember we saw stuff during the keynote
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.140]   in Steve's presentation.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.940]   It's not presently in the iLife Suite,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   and he was running on a little leopard shell.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.420]   And if you're of the opinion that we're
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.260]   going to see major enhancements like pinch,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.020]   well, that's not going to happen unless you get a new--
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.140]   Totally.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.020]   Does it have a reputation for having kind of surprising
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.620]   last-minute stuff get put in?
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.060]   I mean--
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.820]   Vise for a second.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.180]   I think it has a reputation for last-minute stuff not
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.940]   happening.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.900]   Oh, like falling off.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.780]   I just hear things.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.620]   Well, I think we're in danger of the perpetual--
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.380]   this is going to ship any day status on the leopard here.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.060]   Right.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.580]   It's not-- Apple's not saying that, are they?
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.820]   I mean, it's not like they're going--
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.900]   we swear it's almost ready.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.820]   I mean, there's-- is in their relative radio
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.220]   silence about the status?
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.460]   Well, except for promising when it's going to come out,
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.140]   then that effect of having it take forever is still wet.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:13.980]   Did they say spring?
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.860]   Was that what they're--
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.740]   That was what they said originally.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.300]   And what's the last day of spring?
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.540]   Yeah, that's what we're all trying to figure out.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.540]   Well, with the last--
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:22.900]   What's the last--
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.860]   I don't mean--
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.060]   I think it's-- you know what it is?
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.180]   I think it's metric spring.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.220]   We're on Imperial Spring.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.580]   But I think they have a--
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.660]   No, it's spring on Venus is the thing.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.340]   It's the Venusian spring.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.700]   Well, it's not-- you know, it's somewhere around June 22nd.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.220]   I'm looking-- it's not--
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.060]   I don't see it anywhere in the ICal US holidays calendar.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.420]   But I think it's around the equinox is around--
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.620]   or what do you call it?
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.340]   Spring when ox is around June 22nd, I think.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.580]   So when is WWDC?
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.860]   It's earlier than that.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.540]   It is.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.340]   June 11th is-- that's why everybody thinks
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.820]   that's when the iPhone's going to show.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.260]   Well, I don't know.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.820]   I don't know.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.140]   What other predictions might you have?
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.860]   I would still-- I mean, now I'm not
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.980]   going to go out and buy this now after all this crap.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.860]   But I still wish-- I still think--
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.940]   I wish and think that they should do something with a smaller--
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.100]   if there's some way they could put out a 12-inch again.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.380]   You know, we talked about this a few months ago.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.380]   12-inches are still retaining the value like crazy.
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.260]   I'd love to see it.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.740]   Because I mean, you just-- you can't beat it for portability.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.540]   And this is one way in which PCs are just eating their lunch.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.820]   You can get a fairly inexpensive PC laptop
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.420]   that's-- you can put in a bag without breaking your back.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.500]   I would like to see--
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.860]   I don't know why we haven't seen Blu-ray support.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.100]   I think we're going to see that.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.900]   There are now terabyte hard drives out there.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.260]   I know anybody who would buy 16 gigs of memory probably
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.620]   would like two or three terabyte hard drives.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.740]   Well, here's what I did get just so you'll know I
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.940]   got those new G drives that Alex is always talking about,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.100]   the 1.5 terabyte raids.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   And they are fast, fast, fast.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.780]   Somebody called me on the radio show and said,
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.220]   well, I want to buy an external drive.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.300]   Should I get a G drive?
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.740]   And I said, well, I have a friend who has like 12 of them.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.740]   But I don't know if it's been the extra money for normal use.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.420]   Would you?
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.020]   Do you think?
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.700]   Well, you know, in this case, these are drives
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:23.740]   that you haven't seen yet.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.740]   These are brand new ones, Leo.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.860]   These are the 1.5 terabyte versions.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.820]   And they are very-- the throughput is the big deal on them.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.740]   And they are fast enough to capture HDMI video direct.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.180]   Wow.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.020]   And I bought them for this multimedia purpose.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:38.860]   So that's different.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.460]   Yeah, that's different.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.860]   And the other G drives you saw at my condo,
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.220]   those G drives are fanless.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.180]   And since I used to use them in my studio,
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.500]   the fanless portion is why I spent the extra money
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.580]   because they don't make noise.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.260]   OK.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.860]   Did you just-- just on our last topic.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.060]   Did you see this post on boing, boing via slash dot
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:02.140]   about the top 10 Blu-ray discs?
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.860]   Did you see this post?
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.580]   Well, the number one is Casino Royale, which sold a hundred--
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.700]   Casino Royale.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.660]   Well, so they're saying here Casino Royale came out
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.460]   to March 13.
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.940]   And in this one week, this week ending--
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.700]   I forget where here-- sold 28,000 copies.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.140]   OK, that's number one at 28,000 copies.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.260]   What's number two?
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.620]   Number 10 is Babel, which sold 880 copies.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.220]   Yeah, that's--
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:24.700]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.700]   Nobody's coming in.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.180]   Nobody's coming in.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.300]   I actually have the Babel HD DVD on my desk.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.660]   It's a beautiful disc.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.460]   As we know, part of the problem is you can't find this stuff
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:34.820]   anywhere.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.460]   I was in borders yesterday, before trying to find--
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.620]   I walked around to the two or three clerks and said,
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.820]   you got any Blu-ray discs because I have a Blu-ray player.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.900]   And they're like, what's Blu-ray?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.700]   I went to the warehouse in town and I said,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.900]   do you sell any high-def discs?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.300]   I said, no.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:49.780]   Wow.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.620]   No.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.900]   At least they knew what it was.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.140]   Sorry, Merlin, what did you say?
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:55.740]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.180]   I interrupted you.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.540]   I walked past a blockbuster video the other day
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.220]   and I just thought, man, that's a job I would not want.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.940]   It's having to be a blockbuster at this point.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   And figure out how you're going to keep,
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.740]   with the incredibly long tail of the way DVDs work
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.820]   and how Netflix is able to serve that kind of need.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.660]   How would you even stock a blockbuster at this point
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.980]   with DVD's HD?
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.580]   Well, you don't put an HD disc in.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.460]   I'm going to be unhappy.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.380]   Although, as you point out, the dirty little secret
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.820]   of these high-def discs is a lot of them
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.580]   are selling fewer than a thousand of items.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.580]   Tell you what this feels like.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.820]   This feels like about 1978 and where we were with,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.900]   what came before laser discs, what was this called?
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.580]   The--
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.300]   Oh, those interactive--
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.900]   But those huge ass, they look like LPs, those big--
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.300]   Well, those are laser discs, yeah.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.540]   And then before that, there was CDI.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.660]   There was actually VCD or something.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.420]   VCD, yeah.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.260]   The video CD.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.020]   There were those.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.500]   And then remember, back in the day before they got everything
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.020]   squared away, and if you wanted to buy a copy of MASH in data,
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.620]   it would be like $100.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.860]   That's what this reminds me of, because--
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   So get this, though.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.620]   Again, this is from that Boing Boing post from April,
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   I think, 9th.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.100]   So number one is Casino Royale at $28,000.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.220]   Number two is the departed at $3,050.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.820]   That falls off very rapidly.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.340]   Wow.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.460]   Now, that's one week sales.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.100]   And in fact, Casino Royale did end up
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.500]   selling over $100,000.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.060]   The first high-def disc to sell over $100,000.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.060]   But those numbers are not sufficient to sustain a business.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.300]   I can tell you right now.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.900]   You don't think that'll pick up, Scott?
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.460]   I think it'll pick up what I'm just saying.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.180]   If it doesn't, you can forget about all this high-def disc
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:28.660]   stuff.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.900]   It's not going to be around for long,
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.300]   because these people, the marketing budgets
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.180]   that I've seen associated with these products,
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.420]   I mean, they're losing somewhere on the line of $800 to $1.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.500]   Well, and frankly, this is the problem.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.340]   They created this problem themselves
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.420]   by having two competing incompatible formats.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.780]   I have no security.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.620]   And one of the worst retail distributions
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.780]   I've seen of any new product.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.540]   I mean, there's poor training, obviously, at the borders,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.340]   because the people don't even know what it is.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.540]   I did eventually find a single Blu-ray disc
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.780]   hidden on a rack, so they have some.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.940]   But I mean, this kind of sea change
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.780]   requires a total top-down approach
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.780]   in how you're going to get things out from the district
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.460]   of your own model.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.660]   Because so many people have high-def televisions.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.740]   And on the guy that is the best way to look at high-def TV.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.580]   I'm standing there going after Alex ruined cable HD for me.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.700]   Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.820]   Now I can no longer stand to watch anything,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.060]   except via my high-res stuff.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.500]   So I'm over there with my $60 sticking out
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.980]   of the top of my shirt pocket going,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.900]   I want to buy this incredibly, stupidly priced disc.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.660]   And they don't have them.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.940]   Is that what they cost?
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   $60?
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.300]   Well, not always.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.140]   No, no, no.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.580]   That's the ones I bought so far, $60.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.580]   So I don't know.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.100]   I still don't have some--
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.420]   I thought they might just see you coming in.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   I think it's just the sky.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.660]   I'm stopped.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.020]   Listen, stop it.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.660]   I bought--
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.580]   There's a man who put 16 gigs of memory in his machine.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.180]   Quick, triple the price.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.100]   Listen, I spent $60 because that's what they told me it cost.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.660]   Are there some of them cheaper?
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.740]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:00.260]   OK.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.260]   The price is only--
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.020]   So "Sinner Royale" is 38 MSRP.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.380]   This is an interesting fifth element is number nine.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.580]   A movie that if memory serves from about what, 96 or 97?
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.820]   But it's a really good movie.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.100]   It looks really good.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.700]   Well, if I paid too much, then somebody who sold it to me
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   cheated me and I'll find it.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.260]   The departed is $27.95 on Amazon.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.180]   Batman because his 1995.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.180]   Children of Men, which is the one I want desperately,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.940]   is $27.95.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.020]   I just got it.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.860]   Yeah, that's supposed to be a great HDD.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.340]   Oh, such a great movie.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.780]   1995 for "Serenity."
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.820]   This is Amazon prices.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.860]   Well, see, I'm talking retail prices.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.540]   So I don't know.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:37.980]   Maybe--
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.900]   You got to get on the Amazon.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.940]   Get on the Amazon price.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.700]   This is 40 bucks.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.180]   OK.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.340]   Well, I paid too much, then I'll find it.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:44.820]   Which movie?
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.700]   But in any event for which movie?
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.140]   I'm trying to remember what it is.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.060]   The 40 bucks, 60 bucks or so.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.060]   It was one that was long.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.020]   I can remember that.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.780]   Oh, it was probably.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.380]   It was probably "Pocalypse Now."
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.020]   The director's no cut version, which in fact--
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:58.860]   I swallowed a bug.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.380]   The horror.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.820]   The horror.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.220]   So "Sinner Royale" was two discs.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.820]   Well, the one I've looked at, I bought two
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.100]   and I've only watched one of them.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.460]   And I can't remember which one it was.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.140]   But all I remember is being enthralled with the video quality.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:15.740]   Yeah, they looked--
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.740]   I've been telling you, that's why I'm surprised these things
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.460]   aren't selling better, because if you have an HD TV--
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.020]   and I guess because a lot of people
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.500]   don't have the HD players.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.460]   But you know, I mean, if you get a PS3,
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.500]   or you get a-- if you have an Xbox 360,
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.180]   you spend 200 bucks for an HD DVD player.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.100]   That's what I did.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.820]   And it really makes that screen shine.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.380]   If you wanted to buy one of these--
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.540]   they're like, well, like 400 bucks for a Blu-ray player.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.700]   To stand alone, there's a $300 Toshiba.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   The dual formats are $1,200.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.740]   You can spend six and get a PlayStation 3,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.460]   and it includes a Blu-ray player.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.380]   Right, right.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.020]   And that's probably the way to go.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:53.580]   That's what I did.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.900]   200 bucks to add one to your Xbox 360, which is the cheapest.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.460]   But Toshiba's HDA2 on Amazon right now, $309.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.860]   Well, let's do one of those things we do,
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.980]   where we ask the audience to help us and say,
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.020]   if you have a great online or San Francisco-based source
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.540]   for Blu-ray discs, let us know.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.020]   Well, I get them on Amazon.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.380]   That's what I basically just-- in fact,
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.100]   they just ordered children to men,
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.540]   because you said it was so good.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.740]   Hey, let's wrap this sucker up with our picks.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.180]   We only have three guys on here.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.700]   Alex couldn't make it today, so it's going to be pretty quick.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.060]   We've got a number of people on our MBW ideas on Delicious.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.260]   By the way, if you've got an idea of Storyforce,
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.300]   that's the tag to use on Delicious, MBW ideas.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.940]   A number of people put sticky windows on here.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.740]   I saw it on Dig as well, and I downloaded it.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.660]   You remember in OS-- I guess it was OS 9,
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.140]   where you could tab windows down to the bottom of the screen,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.500]   and then just be a little tab?
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.180]   Of course.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.380]   It's back.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.820]   Only these sticky windows, you could put them
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.660]   on any part of the screen.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.900]   And they minimize, they go back up.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.420]   It is just a great way to organize windows.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.220]   And I missed it when it was in OS 10, and now it's back.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:10.780]   And I think it's $15 shareware, and it's really a nice little piece
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.300]   of software.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:15.260]   I bought the family pack for $40, and got it on all my systems.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.660]   So it's sort of a little bit like when you send it down
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.940]   to the dock, except it's just a little tab that pops up.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.260]   It's a tab that can be any side of the screen.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.820]   Is this the one-- I remember back in the day,
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.460]   there was one where it was almost like minimizing
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.300]   a good on the bottom.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.660]   You get a folder tab, and when you click it,
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.940]   it'll kind of slide up like a drawer.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.540]   Kind of like that.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.020]   When you mouse over, is that what it does?
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.380]   Not when you mouse over, you click it.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.820]   You can have it do what you would like it to do,
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   which is automatically when you open one,
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.220]   hide all the other windows.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.820]   So you would love this with your clear screen effect,
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.620]   because with a black screen, no menu bar,
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.260]   you just see the tabs for the windows you want.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.420]   You click the tab, it zips up.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.180]   You would love it for the ADD.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.940]   I am sure I don't know what you mean.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.300]   Anyway, it's from Donaleski.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.940]   It also has one of the most pretty, I think,
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.100]   system preference paints.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.380]   They've got a pink butterfly.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:00.860]   It's pink.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.300]   The big is very big gun pink.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.580]   I guess it's a moth, not a butterfly.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   But I thought this was really great.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.820]   D-O-N-E-L-L-E-S-C-H-I, Donaleski.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:16.060]   And it is free to try to give you a little nagging,
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.740]   but that's all.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.180]   I think this is a very nice little tool,
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:25.780]   Donaleski.com, sticky windows, sticky windows.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.700]   And Mr. Scott Borne, you have a pick for us, I know?
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.180]   Business card composer.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.460]   I wanted not to make some business cards.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.740]   I wanted to make some little business card size
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.300]   promotional things, because we're opening the production
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.940]   studio here in San Francisco.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.540]   And I was talking to printers, and they wanted zillions of dollars
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.740]   to do something pretty basic.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.860]   Somebody had mentioned to this program to me before,
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.180]   so I thought I'll try it out.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.500]   It's $35.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.460]   And you can perfectly interact with all your own stuff
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.500]   from iPhoto and everything else, and make these cool little
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.820]   business card size promo things using Avery stock,
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.460]   or print on anything you want.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.700]   When you print these out, they always have that little rough
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.900]   edge on it.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.220]   But no, see, that's the cool thing.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.020]   The Avery ones don't.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.100]   You can get the ones that don't have edges.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.340]   So if you needed to make business cards that looked pretty
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.380]   legit, and you use this for that, they looked very real.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.180]   But more importantly, you can use this for all kinds of other
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.180]   things where you just want to make a small little card
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.020]   to promote something.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.260]   Like federal bikini inspector.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.900]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.260]   I have that card.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.820]   I've been scotching this tonight.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.980]   Actually, when we start to do the non-clean version of
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.340]   Macri-Gree, I'll probably--
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:39.900]   Yeah, that's not true.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.460]   Anyway, the thing is, is that I got the looking at this, and
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.580]   everyone says, well, yeah, there's other ways to make
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.300]   business cards.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.500]   And yeah, there is.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.100]   But this is so easy that it just doesn't pay to do it any
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.180]   other way.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.500]   What I really like about it, incredible ability to
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.380]   interact with all your other stuff like iPhoto and just
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.820]   make it really seamless.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.700]   It's the way Mac stuff is supposed to work.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.100]   It's from Blight, B-E-L-I-G-H-T software.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.460]   I have no relationship with these people.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.100]   They don't even know I like their program, probably, but I
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.260]   did buy it.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.820]   Very cool.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.620]   And finally, Merlin Mann, your software pick of the week?
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.660]   Well, I'm going to do that thing John Foster hates, and I'm
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.580]   going to suggest something that I have not spent a lot of
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.460]   time with.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.420]   But I am really impressed with the look of it so far.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   You guys go look at ubercaster.com.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.580]   I know all about it.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.220]   Have you guys seen it?
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.580]   Have you tried Ubercaster?
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.460]   I've been with the alpha and then the beta.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:45.340]   Ubercaster is an all-in-one audio podcasting tool that I
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.700]   didn't have time to spend a lot of time with it, but you open
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.140]   it up and it's got different modes.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.540]   It's got a mode for preparing your podcast, the mode for
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.580]   recording your podcast, and so on.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.100]   And I'm just, for folks who want-- and it's really, really
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.820]   good looking-- and it has these templates that work a
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.180]   little bit like, I guess I assume like Pro Tools, in my
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.180]   experience, something like sound capture programs that let
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.100]   you go in and process.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.540]   You can drop in MP3s of music.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.100]   It has ducking, so they can turn the music down for any
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.340]   speed.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.020]   It's got automatic duck procedure.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.780]   But this is a really-- I want to spend more time with this,
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.100]   but it's a really neat looking program.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.460]   And I mention it also because I see here that it's got a
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.140]   bundle with another wonderful program that's a previous
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.620]   pick of mine called Feeder.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.820]   And it looks like you can buy these two apps together for
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.820]   15% off right now.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.460]   Wow, that's a good idea because then you'd really have
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.100]   everything you need to make your podcast, right?
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:35.980]   That's right.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.620]   Feeder, I got to say, I'm using Feeder to make-- oh my
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.380]   god, I'm using it.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.860]   Of course, Ben laughs at me because he writes, I don't know,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.020]   he writes all of his own XML by hand or something.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.540]   But I love it.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.580]   If you've got to make your own feedies, it's great.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.580]   Anyway, check it out, ubercaster.com.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.020]   I'm not sure what the price is, but--
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.860]   Here, let me clip the big buy now.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.260]   Wow, it's 80 bucks.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.460]   OK, never mind.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.340]   That's right.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.300]   I just want to point out that GarageBand is free and has
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.140]   most of these same features.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.380]   Yeah, but GarageBand--
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.380]   That's right.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.940]   It also breaks a lot.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.580]   Well, as long as you don't go over 40 minutes, it doesn't.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.660]   Well, here's the thing, though, Scott.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.340]   I may agree with you.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.540]   And GarageBand, I think it is--
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.060]   I don't love GarageBand for recording podcasts, to be honest.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.260]   No, it isn't that great for recording.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.460]   It's better for assembling.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.180]   I have used it, yes.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:26.180]   I have used it for editing.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.420]   And I really like the ease of compression and stuff like that.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.820]   I tend to record in Sound Studio or Amadeus 2,
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.780]   or just a capture program.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.100]   But anyway, I thought this was kind of neat.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.900]   There's a lot of people out there who are interested in
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.940]   starting podcasts, but they obviously don't want to become
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.540]   a complete dork like us.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.460]   So I think it's nice that there's something like that out
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:43.780]   there.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.180]   I have a mini tip if you allow me.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.500]   You know how big fans of TextExpander?
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.260]   Yes.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.580]   I smile on my neck.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.140]   Yes, I know what you're going to say, go.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.980]   I love this.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.700]   I just had a post on this yesterday.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.100]   So TextExpander is a program that lets you add little
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.580]   shortcuts, little you type a little shortcut, and that
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.620]   explodes into a big bunch of text.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.300]   So you could say, like, in my case, I type any W-C-E-L-L,
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.980]   and it types out my new cell phone number that I refused
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.780]   to remember.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.780]   All kinds of great stuff like that.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.900]   Well, you'll never learn it that way, Mr. Man.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.700]   Well, this is the future, Leo.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.420]   And so they previously had this wonderful bundle of snippets
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   you can add that has all of the most popular or unpopular
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.220]   corrections for spelling errors.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.340]   They just added a new one this week that has really cool
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.420]   little snippets for HTML.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.060]   So if you're somebody--
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.660]   I'll put it immediately.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.260]   It works pretty great.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.860]   So if you're somebody who spends a lot of time typing,
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.500]   especially in web forms, it's future time--
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.900]   You have to remember the little abbreviations.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.740]   It's the only negative, but it is nice to have.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.060]   They're pretty transparent.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.100]   And they all begin with comma, so they've got their own
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.980]   little namespace.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.340]   So if you type comma h2, it creates paired h2 tags, for
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:50.660]   instance.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.860]   So anyway, that's @smilemymac.com.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.740]   I'm sure you can find it where you can see the post on 43
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.420]   folders.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.180]   So anyway, tip and a half.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.940]   And then it's got also dot, like,
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.620]   dot for all the HTML entities.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.060]   You've got dot amp or dot bu or dot c for the copyright.eu
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:06.700]   for your own--
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.700]   Yeah, that's a good trick.
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.300]   People who are--
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.180]   I haven't gotten in this.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.620]   But people who are serious text expander ninjas will use
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.300]   some kind of a meta character or--
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.300]   It's created namespace.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.380]   It's got a lot of commas for, like, the HTML and dot
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.980]   is for the entities.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.180]   It's like the old days when you put spaces and underscores
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.140]   in front of file names.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.140]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.580]   Well, we're out of time, but I'm glad we could get together.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.900]   Now, I think we're going to take next week off, because
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.700]   it's NAB.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.780]   So a lot of people are going to be at NAB.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.620]   You probably want to listen to TWIM.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.100]   And who knows?
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.820]   Apple may have some announcements at NAB.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.300]   It's not unheard of that they would announce pro products
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:39.780]   at that.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.380]   It's a national association of broadcasters
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.580]   shown in Las Vegas.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.420]   Alex will be there.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.900]   Are you going, Scott?
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   No.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.700]   Nor am I.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.460]   And I guess you're not going, Roland.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:54.300]   I'll be having lunch with people who are going to Web 2.0.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.220]   Oh, that's right.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.300]   Web 2.0 is this week.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:56.660]   Is next week.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.980]   Oh, yeah, we're going to be drilling down all day.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.020]   It's a big story there.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.780]   And I'm going to be in Vancouver doing the TV show.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.980]   So we're just going to take next week off.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.700]   But we'll be back a week from Tuesday
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.860]   with another episode of Mac Week.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.260]   Thank you.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.300]   Have a great Mac Week.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.100]   We'll see you next time.
