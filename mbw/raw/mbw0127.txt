[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, Episode 100.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And this episode brought to you by Andy's Hat.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times, wearing his
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Colorado University hat.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   What are those?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   The University of...
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Are those bison?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   The mighty buffalo, Leo.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Is that what you like to do?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Well, I go to school there every year for the past 12 or 13 years to speak at the conference of World Affairs
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   on the Boulder campus.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They have not rewarded me with an honorarium yet, but they have
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   rewarded me with a 10% discount on all CU logo merchandising.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   That's a good deal.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'll take what I can get.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Anything to beef up that'll CV.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Also here from upstairs, it is Alex.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I walked all the way down the stairs.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He lives up here now, which is great.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We love having you.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   You should have an ocean.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   You should introduce it by just leading out the window and shouting,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "Naughton!"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "Naughton!"
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   "Naughton!"
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   "Naughton!"
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "What a wealthy boy.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   What do you got?"
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "We're doing a show."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "Hey, Norton.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We're doing a show down here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm coming down."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now, we were going to have Bobby Llewellyn.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   He's got a new podcast, which is such a good idea.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's called Carpool, where he drives famous British people around in his car and interviews them.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But I don't...
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I think he's...
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   He may appear at some point.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Of course, he's the former star of Red Dwarf.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He played Criton.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   The rubber-faced robot on Red Dwarf and has been on the show before.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We love having Bobby Llewellyn.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   But before we...
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And Scott is taking the day off because his truck is being towed.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Or Scott.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   He didn't...
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I think it broke down.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He didn't sound that he parked it in the wrong place.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He broke down.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Very important.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Make that distinction.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, you know, I'm kind of surprised.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I would expect him to have a brand new truck that's really big and shiny and starts itself.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He probably does.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Toes itself.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.760]   I expect him to have like...
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.240]   In the back pickup of the truck to have one of those smart cars just in case of emergency.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.000]   So we can just sort of drive it off the truck when it breaks down.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Go get gas.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Drive back.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Drive it back into the ramp.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   Scott's car is so big.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   He's got a smart car in the back.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.720]   Just in case it breaks down.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.120]   That's a great idea.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920]   So the top stories on the Mac Break Weekly list.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.440]   By the way, if you want to ever contribute stories to us, just bookmark them on delicious
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.680]   d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.com with the tag m-b-w-i-d-s.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.840]   And then you can go to m-b-i-d-i-d-s.com, which I think Merlin Man owns.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.280]   And so I don't know how much longer it's going to last.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.960]   That's Merlin to give it to us.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.160]   And you'll see a link to the stories that we are talking about today.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   Apple stock going up, which is kind of a surprise.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.920]   Despite the bad stock market in general and despite the news about Steve Jobs, I guess
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.440]   the market liked the quarterly report.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.240]   Well I think that the issue is that Apple's making money when a lot of people aren't.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   So everyone's doing losses.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.200]   It's not just that they made money.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.480]   We talked about this previously is that they had their best quarter ever.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.360]   Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever in the middle of a recession.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320]   Did they give an advisory that they might not be doing so well next quarter?
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.240]   Because that's what companies, companies either have abandoned the advisories or are
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.880]   starting to say, "Don't count on much next time."
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.120]   Well that was sort of an odd purview that Microsoft did during CES.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.360]   They took the time out to say, "You know what?
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.480]   We think that our wonderful success over the past 10 years was due not to our vision
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.160]   and our products, but due to a fluke of exuberance in the market."
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.560]   And so please, that profitable ever again.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.760]   Cut to Apple where they're saying, "If you check under your seat, you'll find a bag
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.680]   of $50 bills.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.960]   Just take whatever you want.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   We've got too much now.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.280]   I'll cut and say they're blocking the fire exits and the fire marshals will shut us down
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.680]   if you don't get rid of some of this money cluttering up our offices."
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   Actually, as we record, they have gone down, but so did the market as a whole.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   The whole market's been way, way off.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.000]   In fact, it's a big sell-off right now.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.920]   But they were up on Thursday, Friday, Monday, and now down a little bit today.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.160]   I do think I was doing some searches here and I can't with some good news that is from
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.600]   a little bit in the past just to remind us of how far apples come.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.400]   This is amid rumors that there may be a buyer interested in Apple.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.840]   The troubled computer maker's share price has soared 14% today in extremely heavy trading.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.040]   Apple closed at 15 and 3/16 share, up 1 and 15/16.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.560]   The number of shares trading hands was 6.4 million more than four times the average trading
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   volume.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   Rumors that Apple take over-
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   Well, I didn't wait by then.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   Why?
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   Well, here's the worst part is that back then there was some...
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   We were sitting looking at this stuff and a guy at Lucasfilm and one of the guys there
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   was saying, "Oh, I got to sell all my Apple stock.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   It's not going to go under."
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   They're just going to go under and I was like, "Oh, you should buy more.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   You should buy more.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   I didn't have any money."
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   But you didn't.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   Well, I didn't have any money.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   I worked...
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   What was that?
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   What year was that?
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.640]   1997, that was July 11th, 1997 that that news came out.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Wow.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   Yeah, they've done okay.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   They've done all right.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.400]   They've not been too shabby.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.520]   They've done all right.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   So what else is in the Apple?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.760]   Are you guys going to buy a Kindle Kindle 2?
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   Kindle 2 is the next?
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   I don't know yet.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.320]   I'm a big Kindle fan.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.880]   They're going to be sending me one as soon as it ships, so I'll have a chance to play
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   with it for a bit.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.720]   If I didn't own one already, the fact that a friend of mine as good as Andy Anato was
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.440]   so enthusiastic about it would make me want to buy one.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.320]   It doesn't look like a revolutionary new articulation of it.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.680]   It looks like they gave it a better screen.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.000]   It has more shades of gray, which means that even if you just use it as a book reader,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.840]   it'll give you nicer edge definition on those tiny bits of text, more memory, faster page
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.440]   turns, longer battery life.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.800]   It doesn't look like something that you would basically be used as a murder weapon in a really,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.160]   really bad 1977 Sean Connery science fiction movie.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.360]   It has a little bit of smart design to it.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.920]   It's got round buttons.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   It's got round buttons.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   It's got round buttons.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.000]   I mean, the first thing I saw, I just saw it and I was like, well, it's got round buttons.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I mean, come on now.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.040]   I mean, they've now moved out of the 80s.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.560]   It's not such a compelling thing that if you already have one, you might want to buy one.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   I did order it, but just so I could review it.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.600]   I do like the metal back.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   That looks nicer.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.960]   If God, all they have to do is have a back that doesn't pop off in my hand every third
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.760]   page turn and I'll be very, very happy with it.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.520]   The back of mine, I'm actually very pleased that I have the old Kindle that they've had
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.640]   for the past year and two months to show off because people will believe me when I show
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.920]   off how baffed up, taped up, smudged and everything this thing is.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.080]   I tell them that I love the Kindle and I take it everywhere.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.920]   It's just like a regular book.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.680]   If someone tries to lend you a book that they say they've read 50 times and it's nice
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.080]   and you hear that crackling sound when you open it, you know, it's probably not a very
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   good book at all.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.400]   But if it's all the food stains and dog-eared it, it's like, oh my God, I got to buy me
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   own copies.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   And that's my Kindle.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   I've got Velcro holding that little piece of plastic on the back now.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.160]   Mine's held up pretty well, but I don't take it mine in places.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.720]   It's really just by the bedside.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   It's where my reading material is.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.640]   This is an Apple story because Amazon has said that they are going to make Kindle books available
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.440]   on other platforms, including the iPhone.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.200]   Well, I'm still holding on for my tablet.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.080]   Well, I mean, iPhone, it might even be tolerable.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.400]   And I think that still the killer app connected to all of this is still the iTunes Music Store.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   That if suddenly all of those digital books were available in the iTunes Music Store,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960]   people would be buying them.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.000]   They buy a lot more from them than they're buying on Amazon.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.440]   And I just, it's so painfully easy to order on the iTunes Music Store that I spend way
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.160]   more money than I should just because all I have to do is hit one little button and move
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   on.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.200]   Well, the thing that's cool is that Amazon is pushing hard to get every book ever published
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   on these things.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   So if they get it on other platforms like the iPhone, I mean, already I think it's a
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.320]   quarter of a million books.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.920]   There's a lot of 150,000, something like that.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.360]   They say it's 230, 240,000.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   But that's exactly the sort of buying experience that makes the Kindle so compelling that there
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   are so many times when I'm just not in the mood to spend, you know, $10 times three buying
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.120]   a whole bunch of books for a flight.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.800]   But you know, during the next 20 minute delay, when I'm in the terminal, I'll just, you can
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.440]   download the first chapters of just about anything you're interested in and get three
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.720]   or four hours worth of reading on your belt for free of like good commercial current books.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.680]   And time and time again, I get to like the end of the first chapter of something that
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.240]   I didn't think I'd be terribly interested in.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.920]   But I thought I was just going to be, you know, sort of stealing this first chapter from Amazon.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.400]   And then I'm like, Oh, damn it, I'm going to be clicking this link saying, please purchase
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.120]   this book immediately and have it available on my Kindle in the next 60 seconds.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.320]   And that the thing that I would have missed the most about electronic books is that ability
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.600]   to just walk into a bookstore, leaf through books, read for a bit and find out what strikes
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   my fancy and then then in there, take the book to the counter, decide, yep, this is good.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   This is a keeper.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.160]   I'm going to take it.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.880]   And Kindle really did mirror the experience very, very well.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.360]   It's very, very browsable.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.800]   And then of course, it's just way too easy to buy the book after you're done with the
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   trial.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Right.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   Well, imagine this on an iPhone.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.120]   Would it be as compelling an experience?
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.240]   If they have this, if they had tried before you buy, yes, I'm sure they would.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   I'm sure they would.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.000]   And I think the screen is just a touch small for me to sit there and read it for.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.120]   I mean, I have read, I mean, I have stanza and classics, which are two ebooks for the
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.680]   iPhone classics is pretty legible.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.880]   I see it though, as more of the same sort of advantage we get when we buy movies on the
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   iTunes store where I'm not going to, it's definitely a bit of a pain to watch a full
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.040]   movie on an iPhone screen unless you're in an airline seat.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.120]   But the ability to watch the first hour of a show at home on your Apple TV and then,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.280]   oh, but I got to leave the house right now, merely grab the iPhone out of your dock.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   And now not only is that movie synced to your phone, but it also remembers where you left
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.280]   off.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.560]   And it's the same ability with the Kindle where the Kindle would remain actually, no, I'd
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.720]   actually have a three sort of a three utility thing going on because a MacBook turned on
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   its side gives you huge, brightly illuminated, colorful, crisp pages that are a delight to
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   read.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:16.320]   If I could go from the MacBook to the Kindle to the iPhone in my pocket and always have
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.960]   a book that always remembers where I left off and all my notes and my bookmarks are
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.760]   the same from document from from from.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.800]   So that's one of the features of the new Kindle, right, is that it has a bookmark syncing.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   Yeah, that's a, I mean, I think that's, you know, what they're really saying is you're
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.240]   going to have more than one Kindle.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.040]   But now if they're going to, if they're going to do that, then please have more than one
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.360]   Kindle, please buy another one.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.440]   You'll, they'll sync.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.280]   You can't, you can't enjoy this feature unless you have multiple Kindle's.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.760]   But if they did it with iPhone, you know, if they made a Kindle app for the iPhone and
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.880]   a Kindle app for other platforms and they had similar syncing, man, I mean, then you
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.720]   read it on your iPhone, you get home, you open up your Kindle, it's at the same spot.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   That's pretty, that's pretty.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.280]   It would be a huge win because I often, I usually have my Kindle with me if I have my
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   bag with me.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.120]   Also it fits in the back pocket of my internet pants very, very nicely.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.040]   But the iPhone is the only device that I've built.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.680]   You put your Kindle in the back pocket of your pants?
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.200]   I got, I got my net book in the other back pocket.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.400]   No, it's a big, big butt pants.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.600]   They're tactical pants.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.400]   How many times do I have to explain this to you?
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.200]   They're for tactical operation.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.520]   So it wasn't, it's the Uzi pocket, but you're now using it for the Kindle.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.080]   That's where you used to keep the jaw bones of your quarry so you can claim your bounty
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.480]   and prove that you killed them.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   But you can repurpose, they're for other uses too.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   But you know what I mean?
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.400]   I mean, there are books that I've downloaded that I only read like four pages at a time
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.640]   because I had no idea that at 2.30 in the afternoon, the post office would have this
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.840]   big of a line.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.240]   And so for 10 minutes, I'd get a little bit deeper into an novel that probably wouldn't
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   have sat down and read other books.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.080]   I certainly do that with audio books.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   I mean, my preference is audio books.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.560]   But now I'm showing, this is the classics application that Philip Ryu and his gang wrote.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.200]   And I think it's just, it's very legible.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   You could, I'm showing it on camera for those who are watching it at home.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   It's very legible.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.560]   The page turn is much better, frankly.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.360]   That's one thing, you know, the E-ink screen isn't as crisp.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.800]   It doesn't have that white background with black text.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.560]   And the page turns a little flash.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   And I don't like that.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.280]   But what I keep explaining to people is that an annoyance in a piece of technology is not
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.520]   bad in and of itself.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.000]   What I need to ask the manufacturer is, okay, so you're taking from me the annoyance of
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.560]   having a little flash every time I turn a page, what am I getting in return?
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.720]   And when they say, well, you get an e-book reader that you can basically go for two weeks
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.480]   without recharging, that I can say, okay, I will take that.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   That's a fair trick.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Right.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.160]   Well, yeah, but I'm charging my iPhone every night anyway.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.040]   I mean, the big thing that I get into when I think about my iPhone is that how many devices
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.760]   do I want to carry around?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.040]   You know, that's the, I mean, I'm already, I have a backpack with, you know, three hard
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   drives, a laptop, two cameras, a video camera, and my iPod.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   Yeah, you've got it.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   As an up.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.000]   I'm kind of like, I don't need to have another, you know, but, but I think you keep your internet
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.360]   pants up with my internet belt.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.520]   You get free with every purchase of the, you know, it's like, is it like an ethernet
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.520]   cable?
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   Is that like an internet belt?
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.200]   I'm not some sort of internet okey or something.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   I don't need a cord.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.600]   You've got 40 pounds holding in your pants.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.920]   That's quite a load in your pants.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.520]   How do you, how do you, I mean, you know, sometimes the listeners know when you're trying
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.920]   to manufacture the title of the show.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.520]   It's like the American said, it was a joke.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.120]   That was pretty blatant, wasn't it?
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.480]   And he's pant load.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.520]   Is the name of this show?
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.600]   Oh, I mean, seriously, I have, even if I have a wall in their keys in my pants, I have,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   they start falling down.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.320]   I guess I have no hips.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.000]   You have, I have that contour chisel physique of a professional technology columnist.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   That must be it.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I'm just missing.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Well, I know you wear your pants up under your, under your man chest and over your belly.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Is that it?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.360]   I think I'm just going to sit down.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.680]   I'd over.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   Let's call the next four minutes.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.280]   And just have a 20 row.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   There you go.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.200]   Last Google not to use multi touch in Android, citing a developer who supposedly worked on
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   Android.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.880]   Venturebeat is saying Apple said to Google, please don't put multi touch in Android in
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.840]   the G one.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.440]   The weird thing is Google said, Andy's reading a book, final cut by Stephen box.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   Stop it, Andy.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.120]   I'm not mocking you anymore.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.800]   I'm asking you a question.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.280]   I'm in, I'm in the penalty box.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.880]   It's up to you and me, Alex.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.200]   So Apple asked and Android don't do multi touch.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.360]   Further, the Android team member went on to say they were relieved that Google didn't
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.640]   go against Apple's wishes given the legal storm that appears to be brewing between Apple
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   and Palm.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.680]   Palm is using multi touch in the pre.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.040]   Even if Apple ultimately decides not to pursue legal action against Palm, it's not clearly
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   how likely that is.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.080]   I'm reading for venturebeat right now.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.760]   I'm just reading M.G. Seagly writing, but Apple does have an impressive array of patents
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.800]   on this multi touch.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.720]   Now the question is really that people are starting to bring up is whether that the patents
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   are too wide.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.360]   Well, we talked about it that didn't seem.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.800]   I mean, we've seen this kind of technology before Apple right even patented it.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.160]   Of course, there's also the issue of how many former Apple employees are now working
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.520]   at Palm, right, which kind of opens another can.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.440]   Well, not in California, though, because you don't have the same.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   It competes in California.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440]   That's it's very difficult.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   Okay.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   And he's done with this book now.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   That's too.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   And that's too.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.600]   And you're out of the I'm at a little penalty box now.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.880]   It was the team goon.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.600]   He's sent on the ice to draw that penalty, but get out the lead score.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.120]   I got you out of the game.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.880]   That's all accounted.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.960]   So do you think Apple threatened or asked?
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.280]   I guess that's really the question.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.000]   It sounds like the asking had a little threat behind it, which is, hey, we own this.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.720]   Which is a shame because it's multi touch.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.720]   Everybody ought to have multi touch.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   It's great.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   I had micro stuff.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   Why Apple patented it?
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.480]   I mean, what about the surface?
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.640]   And that's actually technology that works extremely well.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.480]   And it sort of shows you what can be done with this in a more abstract way.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.760]   I mean, it'd be a damn shame if the only thing they'd have more than one contact with a
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.520]   control surface had to have an Apple logo on it.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.920]   I hate patents.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.840]   Well, it's only for 16 years.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.720]   I hate them because I don't have any, but I'm sure that if I invested X millions of dollars
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.280]   into developing something that is actually practical and let's give Apple some props
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.680]   there, they're the first company to make a really practical and useful multi touch interface.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.040]   And the other thing is that their business is based on innovation.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.880]   So that being able to get some being able to.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   Yeah, but multi touch, according to even Wikipedia dates, and maybe the patent office
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.280]   doesn't read Wikipedia.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.320]   It's back to 1982 as the first multi touch device.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:11.080]   I mean, in 83 Bell Labs published a comprehensive discussion of touch screen based interfaces,
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:19.760]   which included multi touch in 19, a 1991 Pierre Wellner published a paper on his multi touch
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.160]   digital desk, which supported multi finger and pinching motions.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   91.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Right.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   If, if, okay, who's the lawyer?
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.200]   Who's the most literally here?
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.920]   If Apple has a patent, which they applied for just a few years ago, but there is prior
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.160]   art and Apple goes after you ensues you.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.880]   Can you defend yourself by attacking the patent and saying, here's prior art?
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.680]   That's what you'd want to do.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.120]   Or is court assume the patents good?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.600]   No, no, you would you would attack them.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.520]   You would attack the patent as that there is prior art.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   And the question is, is then is how overturn the patent or is it depends on how specific
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   the patent is.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.840]   So just because it's multi touch, it may not be all, you know, it may.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.440]   And it also doesn't mean that it just because there's prior art, it can say that there is
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.920]   prior art, but this is what's different about what we're doing.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.680]   And this is why our solution is different.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.320]   So just because someone's done multi touch doesn't mean that someone can patent a certain
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.920]   way to use multi touch.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.680]   So apples, and I haven't looked at the patent.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.760]   I haven't looked at Apple's patent.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.080]   Well, here's now here's the deal.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   Okay.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   Apple was in 91.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.480]   He had a product called digital desk.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:31.720]   Now, 1999, this is again from Wikipedia, a company called Fingerworks.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.000]   A company started by University of Delaware academics, John Elias and Wayne Westerman produced
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.520]   a line of multi touch products, including the iGestor pad and the touch stream keyboard.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.680]   Westerman had published a dissertation on this in 99.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.200]   In 2005, Apple bought Fingerworks.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.320]   So the patent was probably based on that 1999 product, which Apple owns.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.000]   So it goes back to 99, but there's still this, I still think there's prior art.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.920]   I mean, I'm not arguing this in court, but well, I said that it can be prior.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.560]   It doesn't mean that there can't be.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.280]   It's just that if it acknowledges that prior art and says, but this is what we've changed
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.360]   about that, then that becomes a patentable process.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.920]   And so it's not, you know, just the fact that it, there's someone had a multi touch before
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.240]   doesn't necessarily negate the fact that Apple can patent a certain way that it's being used.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.960]   And in fact, we all saw Jefferson Hans Ted talk with the multi touch system that was so
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   cool.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.360]   And I thought that, you know, predated Apple as well.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.920]   Well, if they had the 1999, it probably did.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   They're clever.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.800]   Well, there's a difference between a demo and a product.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Right.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.600]   Well, is there from the point of view of a patent?
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.680]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.600]   I mean, I got, I mean, the three of the two cameras in this, in this little production,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.280]   one of us is broadcasting from a sumptuously wood paneled office.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.120]   And the other one is in a T-shirt and a baseball cap.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.920]   So I think, so I think on that basis, you have better legal authorities than I do about
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.760]   how that I look like a lawyer.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.680]   My office looks injured in an axis.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.400]   Let's Leo and his team of attorneys tell those insurance companies, you mean business.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.880]   Well, and I think that really the 800 pound gorilla here is going to be Microsoft, which
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.440]   has got the surface and they're going to put multi touch in Windows seven, they said.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.680]   So I think that's the real question.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.440]   Yeah, I mean, it really is key.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.320]   I mean, I was there's a company that always most most pronounced their name, ASUS, a SUS,
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   I think they call it.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.360]   I always want to say ASUS that they showed they have a multi they have a touch base,
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.640]   sort of like a kitchen imagine a kitchen version of the iMac that costs well under $1000 has
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   a nice.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.560]   It's like a 15 or 17 inch wide screen designed to be a really good useful media computer.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   It's like one of their netbooks scaled up as a desktop computer as a desktop and it has
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   a touch interface that is one touch only.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.760]   And that's pretty useful.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.280]   But then you sort of imagine what if I could simply use one finger one finger on the screen
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.400]   to hold something to keep a selection another finger to basically move things together.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   And you realize that single touch interfaces are really holding this use this UI back.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:19.080]   I mean, if Apple had a patent, did Apple ever buy a patent on the basic concept of windows
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.560]   and menus and icons and mouse control because they didn't they licensed it from Xerox part.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   Right.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.480]   And if you can imagine if the Mac OS was the only computer that was ever allowed, it would
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   be horrifying.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   I still I still say that Apple has the best user interface anywhere, but you need other
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.120]   people to have the ability to explore this in other directions.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.960]   And we wouldn't have had Linux in the form and that it's now taking.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.760]   We wouldn't have had windows in the form that's now taking.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.320]   That's just a bad, bad thing.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.640]   Bill Buxton, who's at Microsoft Research, worked on the surface, wrote a really good
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.120]   white paper on his website, Bill Buxton.com.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.240]   He says, I've been asked a lot about multi touch since the iPhone came out and rather than
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.560]   answer all these individual questions, I'm just going to write this paper.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.080]   He says, multi touch technologies have a long history to put it in perspective.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.440]   The original work undertaken by my team was done in 1984, the same year the first Macintosh
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.760]   was released and we weren't the first.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.040]   He says during the development of the iPhone, Apple was very much aware of the history of
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.280]   multi touch dating at least back to 1982 and the use of the pinch gesture dating in 1983.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:30.080]   He says he refers back to that Wayne Westerman PhD, the guy of Fattock finger works and an
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.360]   Apple employee.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   So I guess if you wanted to contest this, I mean, here's the guy from, here's a guy from
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   Microsoft.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.680]   Well, once again, it doesn't mean that they can't, it's a specific, they had to
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.120]   ask you when they do it.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.360]   And the thing is, and now here's the one thing that, but it would open the door for others
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   who are doing an implementation like this earlier work.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   Okay.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.000]   So, Apple had to do it a specific way of doing it.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Exactly.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But you could do it differently.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.560]   You could do it differently and you just have to make sure that you were going around
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   that.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.080]   People failed to list all of the prior art related to what they're doing.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.040]   It would leave, it would leave their patent open to being invalidated.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.560]   So if someone can find stuff that wasn't listed in that prior art, you know, to make
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.680]   that work and, and you, when people start digging this up, they may, there's been some,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.000]   some people have bouncing around saying that Apple may be infringing on multi touch patent
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.360]   zone by University of Delaware.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.000]   So the, the thing is, is that, that there's other pot, there's all kinds of possibilities,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   you know, as this unwraps.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's just going to be kind of a legal.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.320]   And by the way, Buxton points out in his paper that, you know, if you think about it, multi
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.960]   touch originated with, with typewriters, because shift A to make a capital A isn't too touch
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   gesture.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.600]   But there, but there very, you know, that's, I think he's grasping a little bit.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.440]   Well, he's just saying, I mean, he says, I know it may seem a long way for multi touch
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.800]   screens, but it really does start with keyboards.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   Right.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:56.640]   And, but I do think that Palm is, I think the biggest issue is that Palm has put themselves
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   out if they win, it'll be great, but they really put themselves out.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.440]   They really put themselves out on a limb because if they lose, it's over.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.840]   I mean, they now have a tire.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.560]   And that's why, I mean, and you're leaving that up to the legal system, which is not
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.360]   rather than your own ability to implement.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.560]   So it's a, it's a, they're, they're really swinging for the stands, which I think Palm
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.880]   has to do in some ways.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.720]   It is telling though, the Google when asked by Apple not to do multi touch said, okay,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   yeah.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.320]   And also because I don't think that that was their goal to begin with.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.000]   I think when you use a G one, you realize that it has one of the greatest clicky interfaces
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.400]   of any mobile device ever.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.880]   I think that touch is a nice feature that they have, but they weren't really going for
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.440]   multi touch.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.320]   You say it has a nice clicky interface.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.480]   Meaning, meaning in the age of the iPhone, you tend to think that any user interface that's
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.000]   based on tactile physical mechanical controls like like a thumb, like a thumb board or,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.240]   a thumb wheel, things like that is by its nature, less efficient and less advanced than a touch
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.600]   interface.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.120]   I was having problems with the G one when I had it for the first day, because I kept trying
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.320]   to use it like an iPhone.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.240]   I kept holding it in portrait mode.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.800]   And I kept trying to, you know, swoosh my fingers around, trying to call up a keyboard
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   to make things happen.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.400]   Of course, there's no on screen keyboard.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.480]   It wasn't until I decided to sort of forget that I own an iPhone and forget about the
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:27.080]   whole idea of using it in a race position and instead make sure that I just get used to
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.880]   holding it like this, that I really started to appreciate how slick the interface is.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.040]   When you hold it in your hands, a little bit like a game controller, and you have the
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   thumb boards underneath the the the the the uh, alpha and Americanes underneath your thumbs,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.400]   you have this really very, very cool.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.200]   I'm trying to rear image myself as I'm most people are listening anyway.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.520]   So describe what you're doing because everybody can see it.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.040]   I just I'm just adjusting myself some behind the microphone as I showed off.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.800]   Um, if you can imagine holding the iPhone in your right hand and having your having your
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.120]   right thumb over the home button, imagine that instead of a home button, you had a little
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.920]   bit of little track ball and a raid in a nice graceful little arc around that button where
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.000]   the four most critical and important buttons to navigate through the user interface, uh,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.680]   holding it like a game controller in both my in both my hands like that, I really was
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.280]   able to zip through the interface very, very quickly and very, very efficiently and I
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.480]   gained a brand new appreciation for how well thought out it was.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   I mean, there are ways for people who are who prefer that kind of an interface who like
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.640]   to have physical buttons underneath their their hands at all times, you can really fly
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.920]   through this interface, especially if you're signing keyboard shortcuts, which is obviously
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.200]   something that the iPhone, uh, will never be able to take advantage of.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.320]   Right. So that's what that's why I say that this, the the interface of the mechanical buttons
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.480]   and the thumb with the thumb, the, uh, the trackpad track ball. I get what is the word for that
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   tiny, tiny little samples. Yeah. Well, they call it a pearl on the blackberry phones.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.360]   It's the pearl. Yes. Um, but anyway, that was so well thought out that I found it. Now,
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.680]   this is just guesswork on my part, but I found it very, very easy to believe that they were
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.280]   going to do multi touch and they were having some problems trying to figure out how it worked.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.320]   And when they saw, wait a minute, we can cut a whole bunch of development times,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.040]   solve a lot of problems by simply saying, Oh, well, Apple, our friends will, we will show our
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.200]   friendship to you by not developing this technology that we were never really interested in and was
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.920]   going to cost us a lot of money and time to develop. Yeah. Somebody's telling, Poops Tech is telling
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.560]   me in the chatroom that in fact, multi touch is in the, uh, Google phone, but they've just side
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.120]   faster side barded, uh, for the G one, but it is an Android now they're going to have a lot of
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.200]   Android devices. And you know, you're, you're right. You don't really need it on the G one,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.400]   but you might want it if, uh, if Google makes a tablet like kind of device, which I imagine they
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.160]   will. They're talking about netbooks with Android on it. You're talking about their plans or the
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.760]   guy who actually installed it on a netbook. Well, no, I know that they haven't shown it with a
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.000]   netbook, but the rumors are that they're planning it. Yeah, that Google's planning it is. And there's
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.720]   a guy who's done it. It makes sense. I mean, Android is, is an eyes a full fledged operating
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.800]   system. You know, the days when Google denied that they were making an operating system or long
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.640]   gone now, they clearly have, you know, made a full fledged operating system.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:17.960]   Well, and hopefully between between the competition, uh, between Android and the iPhone and hopefully
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.520]   the Palm pre, we're going to see a lot of new new innovation. Yeah, if they don't, if Apple doesn't
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:29.160]   kill the pre, right, that would be very upsetting to me. Although they're being very, very, they're
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.760]   showing Paul a very, very great compliment in that they're not just allowing the company to kill
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.480]   and screw up the project, the product on their own, which is usually the safe bet. The fact that
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.600]   their Apple is being active and trying to kill the product means that they don't believe the
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.680]   Palm still has the ability to kill a product. And I think that some of that might, might point,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.000]   some of that might relate back to the, uh, the fact that that Palm has so many of the iPhone
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.720]   engineers. Yeah. And more to then they just acquire another iPhone engineer, uh, or another Apple
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:04.440]   employee to work at Palm. It's, it's kind of it's almost like an exodus, which seems odd, but I guess
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.640]   if you thought the next big thing was going to be the pre or the web OS was more of you got a big
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.920]   paying jump, somebody gave you a billion dollars. I mean, you know, they doubled. We will double
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.600]   your pay and you're, you know, it's good point. Yeah. I think there's a fair enough chance that
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.320]   the reason why they moved is that they realized that, oh my God, Steve, I just found out Steve
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.480]   Jobs knows my name. This will not work out well. I better get out of here. I'm gone.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:41.560]   In the, uh, in the Merlin man, a memorial segment on the program, the Beatles held hostage day 573.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   Paul McCartney in a recent interview for entertainment weeklies pop watch blog.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:53.000]   Says it, it's the record companies. It's, it's negotiations are going on, but it's still a sticky
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.600]   issue. We wanted to happen. Sid McCartney. We should have, uh, Don McAllister. He's the
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:06.360]   liver puddly and we on for the DAGLY and Bob. We he means me are presumably him, Ringo,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:13.240]   Yoko and Olivia Harrison. Um, they all gave the thumbs up for the rock band Beatles game,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.920]   but the record company was taken over by new people quite recently. So there's a gridlock of
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.560]   sorts. I don't know what's going on. We couldn't get away with this sort of stuff.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.800]   If we weren't here, no, he'd kill me. That's why I'm doing it now. What I'm just waiting for.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.280]   What accent is that he would say? You know, the, the, the thing that I'm interested in this is
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.520]   whether this, uh, whether the copyrights and run out for the Beatles, you know, you know,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.200]   do they run out of it? No, they never, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, cause it was, that was the
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.080]   thing is that they said that by 2014, you know, for some, some of their songs would start,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.560]   would start running because they're in because it British copyright, not Americans 50 years.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.320]   And I'm not sure if that is, that has changed or not. I know there's been some push back and
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.480]   forth, but it would be interesting to see, you know, see what happens in that, in that room.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:05.880]   Uh, one of our chat room fellas web nuts for you too, which makes him very credible.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.640]   It says one of the main programmers on the pre worked with me writing code on the Apple
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.160]   platform for several years. I think that's enough to justify patent infringement.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.400]   It's a good point. The pre was not developed in what we would call a clean room environment.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.000]   Yeah. We know that Rubenstein and others know how it's done.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.400]   Right. And that makes it so much harder for them to say that they're doing it some different
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.400]   way when they have a bunch of people doing it the same, you know, came from the same company.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.320]   And so that that's, that's what makes it hard.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.840]   Yikes. And again, Apple can, Apple can, uh, it's the independent claims that Apple has in the
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.200]   patent, not the dependent claims, all the prior art and everything else that, uh, that, that Google,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.920]   that Palm has to work around to make sure that they're not getting themselves into infringement.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.360]   So the guy that was hired at Palm, actually, is an old friend of mine, Chuck Van Rosbach.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.520]   He, uh, he is, uh, I've known him for years. He and I used to fight when I worked at KGO.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   I was, uh, it was during the dim, dark hair spindler years when I was very negative about
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.080]   Apple because I thought, uh, spindler wasn't doing a very good job that the operating system was
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.480]   long and the tooth and they knew something. And you were right. And I was right. And they
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.760]   needed something new. And, uh, I think, uh, so there were Apple employees who weren't happy about
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:21.640]   me at the time. Uh, Chuck is a great guy though. I love him. And, uh, he is now a developer community
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.480]   manager for, uh, WebOS for the Mojo SDK.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:32.600]   He will bothers me about, about the pre is that I understand why the G one was made because
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:39.000]   it's a unique beastie and it addresses a lot of things that people don't like, uh, about the iPhone.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.800]   I don't necessarily understand how the pre is going to justify its existence in the marketplace,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.520]   especially against three or four different handsets that own like 94% of the market.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.520]   I don't know. It's a, it's a hot market. I think diversity is good for us as users. Don't you think?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:00.040]   Diversity is good, but I like, I just don't think that a product, I think that you can,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.640]   you can compete in the phone market these days by doing two things and two things exactly,
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.560]   doing something better than the iPhone. And there are a lot of ways to do things better than
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:15.960]   you do the iPhone or make the best damn phone you could make that can be sold for $99 or $49.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.160]   And there are a lot of people who are doing great things like that. I was at the phone store,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.840]   just the other day, just to look at a good cheap phone. So I was curious as to what the bottom
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:28.120]   of the market was like. And now the best smartphone you could have bought three years ago has now
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.360]   been made a lot more rational and a lot more relevant and a lot more affordable. 49 bucks will
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.640]   give you a really good web enabled phone with all kinds of great media features. If it's on the
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.040]   Verizon network, for instance, you can cut, you can do things with your home cable box that you
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.960]   cannot do with any other phone because of that sort of, uh, I guess the polite word would be synergy
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.320]   between the cable. So you're saying they should just not do it? I'm not saying they should not do
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.440]   it. I'm just saying that the number the first thing you write on that whiteboard on the first day
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.560]   of that project development is what will this do? What will this deliver at that? Right. You can't
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.720]   see you can't simply say you instead of spending, well, you can. I mean, people do it all the time,
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.680]   but you're thinking palm is a big enough company and important enough company. They should be
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   thinking that well, not only that, but they keep well, actually, it's almost the opposite where
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:22.840]   a company like a company like a Blackberry can afford to do a hand set product. Well, they can
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.520]   do a product that's like, well, we can we we we've heard a lot of our users say that we love our
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.200]   Blackberries, but we want that big screen. We want to be able to watch movies. We want a good
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:38.440]   media experience. And so they can get away with making a device that is touch, ish, and large
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.640]   screen ish, but still a Blackberry. They can they can stick that in their product line and still
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.680]   do well with it. Palm, this is their Hail Mary pass. If this if the pre does not take off,
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   palm is done. They are absolutely done. They have to resinately and reassuringly tell the entire
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.360]   world that we are a great company capable of innovation and capable of doing great products.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.800]   We can't simply say we have something that's a lot like the iPhone only it's incompatible with
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.360]   everything that works with the iPhone. Well, and I think that the the issue is I think palm had to
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.560]   do this. I mean, where where else are they going to go? I mean, they had to go into the smartphone
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.400]   market. They have they don't have a choice. I mean, this is it's a long bomb. But for them,
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.960]   I think that they're in the last 45 seconds of the football game, and they're gonna they're
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.920]   thrown it for the end zone because I don't think that there's any other they don't have another
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:33.400]   play. And I need I need to be very, very clear that a lot of this is my own confusion and my
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.640]   own ignorance. I still have my experience with the pre still is limited to just seeing the videos
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.480]   and seeing the demos. Right. So I've yet I've yet to hold one in my hands. I've yet to get
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:48.440]   information that's beyond what's publicly available. And as I try to learn more about this device,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.320]   that's the number one question in my mind. If someone comes in this, this is this is a big question
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.800]   that I like to ask myself with any product because this is a situation that always happens to me.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.640]   Someone comes up to me or someone emails me or tours me and says, hey, I'm trying to decide
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.160]   between the palm pre and the iPhone. Why should I get one instead of the other?
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.760]   I don't know what I would write in the pre column. Well, I know that if someone, you know, for me,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.160]   it would be tempting if someone had an iPhone that was it was close to what the iPhone did,
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.000]   but it had a video camera, a higher resolution still camera, a camera that could focus. That
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.560]   would be awesome. You know, it's cut and paste and more storage. You know, those are the kind of
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.200]   things that I think are are that the iPhone is those are those are kind of chinks in the armor.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.560]   Yeah, but those are all things easily remedied by Apple, right? But they haven't well,
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.080]   cut and paste seems to be much harder than I expected. I don't think it's hard. I think I
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:43.480]   doesn't want to do it. I can't think it was I would have to be so totally on that damn fence
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.800]   to be swayed by the lack of cut and paste or the lack of or I would have to I would have to have
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.560]   camera camera could be important for some people though. No, I'm saying it's not going to it's not
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.840]   functionality to apps. You know, I mean, some of these store apps, things like that. I don't think
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.840]   that I don't think that it's something that is going to pull an iPhone user away from their
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.880]   iPhone. But I do think what you what you have to do is if you have if you had those things,
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.000]   if you collected those things and put it into a phone that had a great interface,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.840]   it's when the new person is looking at their first smartphone or their next smartphone that
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.360]   and they haven't gotten into the the new the the iPhone or whatever. You got to you know,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.600]   that muddy is the water. They're like, well, I like the iPhone and I've seen it and someone
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.640]   who hasn't experienced it yet or hasn't owned one yet. But you know, I think this might be
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.400]   interesting and being able to carve off just a little bit of that market would be very
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.760]   lucrative for them. Get ready because according to Businessweek, Microsoft has decided to really
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:43.240]   ramp up its I can't even say this with a straight face is getting ready to ramp up its mobile
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.840]   strategy because it was going to be the zoom the zoom phone the zoom phone Microsoft CEO Steve
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:57.240]   bomber will unveil the my phone. It sounds like an onion article is not a new service that
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.400]   allows anyone with the phone running Windows Mobile six to automatically access their photos,
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.760]   context calendar items and other data hosted on a Microsoft website. The service automatically
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:12.600]   uploads photos taken with the phone. This is so this is so 70s too little too late to the users
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   my phone site each day, allowing them edit viewer share the photos later from a PC.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.200]   I bet the first draft of that press release said now in the not today, but in the near future,
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.920]   your Windows mobile phone will be able to do everything that everyone else's phone has been able to do
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:36.600]   since 19 since 2003. According to we finally get it according to senior vice president Andy
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.240]   Lee's who's in charge of Microsoft's mobile effort. This is the first in a series of announcements
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:47.800]   over the next 18 months designed as seamlessly. Oh, I can't even read this crap seamlessly connect
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:55.080]   Microsoft's web offerings with Windows based PCs and phones. The strategic goal is to why is my
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.680]   phone sounds so much like mobile me. The strategic goal is to transform Windows mobile phones into
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.960]   a new category of phones that is distinct from other so called smartphones.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:14.520]   So called Steve, Steve, you're right. The iPhone, it's just a big popularity contest.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.480]   You're right to stay out. You're better than that at Microsoft.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:26.520]   So called those other guys, smart phones. They're not so smart. We're going to connect you to your
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:33.160]   desktop. If it was, if it was there once a Microsoft Microsoft like high VP who responded to either
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.760]   an Apple product or another like really good slick product by saying, Hey, if I'm paraphrased,
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.400]   if the iPhone is so great, why does a Microsoft make it?
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.960]   And then realizing 10 seconds later. Oh, I just threw this right up there with, I know you are,
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.040]   but what am I? That sounded so much more authoritative in my head, but in earth atmosphere now,
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.760]   I have to stop by the grocery store. My way to work tomorrow and pick up some empty boxes,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.680]   I think. Oh, man. Microsoft never really has been a great innovator, but this just just
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.800]   just seemed like they're I mean, to me, it just seems like they're running out of
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.640]   running out of steam. Yeah, I mean, everything is, you know, they I've always believed that they
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:20.040]   were in the right place at the right time once. And that's when Apple got rid of Steve Jobs in 1986.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   I like this last sentence. I this has to be a typo. This is from Business Week.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.360]   Okay. Peter Burroughs writing in the tech beat column and Business Week magazine.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.680]   This has got to be a typo in here. Please, please, please parse this sentence.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:40.120]   If all those owners of Windows PCs decide they want a Windows PC to go with it,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.600]   it might be the company's best chance to leverage its PC monopoly to resuscitate its status in the
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   boat booming mobile sector. Okay, the problem with that is that he didn't get the words scalable,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:59.400]   social, or enterprise or synergy, other, other exactly. Otherwise, it would have been the perfect
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:05.400]   piece of PR gobbly gook. We've got some synergy here that we've sold millions of machines. If
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.360]   they don't buy a Windows mobile phone, we'd be rich. If we let it leverage the synergy between
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:17.880]   the Windows mobile to what the thing is, we have scalable multiplex for producers for both
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.960]   so-ho and enterprise. This will allow this synergy will allow social marketing, social
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:31.080]   networking within our phones. But Alex, is it available in a blade configuration?
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.960]   No, but you get it in brown. But we are thinking of connecting it to MySpace and Facebook.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   In fact, we're going to create our own MySpace and Facebook because only it will be called Micro
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:48.520]   Space. And now I will release the killer bees that have been affected with the famous brain
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:56.760]   of malaria. Only four people should have to endure this. Okay, our new business plan is we're
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.000]   not in the antidote business. You've got to know we've got to believe there's a lot about this
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.400]   new product in the next three months. I don't want to tip my hat. If Apple is the disease,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:13.000]   we've got the cure. Well, anyway, my luck, you know, good luck, Microsoft, we do need,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.160]   you know, we do need a strong Microsoft to keep Apple from running away with the game.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.040]   Let's give them their due. I've always thought that their brilliance as a company has not been
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.160]   an innovative new products, but figuring out how to sell basically figuring out when to put their
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.680]   money in and how best to sell something that other people are already selling very, very well.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.920]   I mean, not innovators. They're there. They're successful.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.680]   So I mean, there's their business. Yeah. All right.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:48.920]   Innovators dive typhoid on the typhoid. Excuse me. What is it? The explorers dive typhoid in a
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.160]   mountain pass. It's the settlers who get the land. Good point. You don't want to be there.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.760]   No, they off they used to said, you know, the first mover advantage first mover hasn't had
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.280]   an end in years. The other thing they say is that if you're if you're one step ahead of the
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.520]   crowd, you're a leader. If you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:08.120]   Good point. All right. Let's see. Any other stories that we
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.800]   look a little by little with all these buzzwords and these nice phrases. If we keep this up for
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:17.240]   12 more minutes, we could have a best selling business book. It's true. It's true. First,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.040]   we'll make all of our money through the seminars. But hey, I'm ready to be rich.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:25.160]   All right. That's that's what we're going to call it. Are you ready to be rich? Who has the antidote
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:32.840]   to your killer be? Do you? Do you? How about you? Well, by the end of these 90 minutes,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.160]   you're going to have that antidote and we're going to give it to you. Right, Alex? Exactly.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:42.760]   We're going to make money for you. You're going to make money for you. We're simply going to
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.160]   point you in the right direction. Everybody's set up on a powerful direction. Now, here's a story
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.600]   you're going to like Andy Inako. Marvel is going to start selling digital comic books and iTunes.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.880]   What do you think about that? Well, see, they're not digital comic books. They're, I think they
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:04.520]   call it motion comics. DC has been doing this for a little while. On the set of The Watchmen,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.160]   they've been the actual production team of The Watchmen got an extra
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:15.800]   X millions of dollars to produce a series of animated, I suppose you could say animated versions
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.520]   of the scenes that they're shooting and other and extra scenes that they're shooting, which you can
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.720]   buy on DVD or buy on a subscription basis. And those are kind of cool because they're simply saying
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.640]   that this is something we're articulating The Watchmen in as many ways as possible,
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:33.080]   now that our money is all on the table. But I've always thought that cartoons are cartoons
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.800]   and great cartoons are great. Comic books are comic books and great comic books are great,
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:44.280]   but you don't make a comic book into a cartoon just by animating key panels. You don't use
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.320]   flash animation to do camera pans across static panels and decide that, well, this figure in the
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.480]   background is going to be unsheathing his claws. And this figure in the foreground is going to be
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.720]   blinking hard. And we're going to make that into a valuable way of experiencing a comic book.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.560]   So is it a video? What is exactly? Is it a PDF? What is it?
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.400]   It's, I don't know what the format is, but it's essentially, if you look at kind of like
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.480]   flash animation, I think we don't think you're looking at the, yeah, that's through what you're
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.280]   looking at right now. Where they are, this is on the Marvel site. This is a video that they
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.600]   distributed. So it looks like it's the comic book, but they're kind of somewhat animating it.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.240]   Meaning where if there's a figure crouching on a table, then again, this is like regular
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:30.600]   production art for a comic book. And so they can simply say, well, what if we, while this
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.680]   character is saying this dialogue will go into Photoshop and will warp his face. So it looks
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.560]   like he's slightly turning his head while he's delivering this dialogue. And we'll basically
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:46.040]   mask out this guy's arm and will rotate it like over 12 frames over two seconds. So it looks like
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.440]   he's actually emphasizing his, the download would be, I still don't know, is it an application that
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   you're downloading? I mean, I believe, I believe it would be a video file that you would, you would
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   purchase. They say they're going to put it on YouTube. Okay. Then it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.400]   something that they're just offering as a video, as a podcast or anything like that. I mean,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.520]   the weird thing is that everything comes full circle. Back in the 60s, they did some really
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:14.200]   awful cartoon versions of Spider-Man and Thor and the rest by doing almost exactly the same thing
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.400]   that would simply. Yeah, it looks like speed racer animation kind of. Exactly. It's more like,
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.960]   it'd be more similar to like Terry Gilliam cutout animation, where they would take the actual
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.440]   artwork from the comic and just say, well, what if we slide this figure, we put this figure on one
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.840]   sheet acetate, this background figure on another sheet of acetate, we simply slide one over the
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.000]   other. So it looks like he's sort of running from left or frame to right to frame. The thing is,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.600]   it just doesn't work. I think that if they are going to take the effort to go into digital,
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.080]   they should go all the way, just allow me to purchase a PDF. If you want to find a way to put
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.400]   DRM on it, fine, just give me a PDF. Don't even give me any tricky camera moves. Don't give me a
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.640]   special flash embedded viewer. Right now they have a digital Marvel digital comics online,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:00.760]   which is a service that you can subscribe to that will give you static page, turny, you know,
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.600]   versions of comics that are like three months to like 30 years old. Just give me a file that I
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.280]   can download an experience. Anybody who's ever turned their MacBook on their side or turned
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:18.600]   their their netbook on their side realizes that in many ways, watching the reading these comics,
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.040]   one page at a time as static pages is even a superior experience to actually reading them in
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.280]   print because the pages are larger, they're all brighter, the colors, the colors are more saturated,
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.000]   the images are sharper. It's just the way that it's the way that you would get me to spend 12
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.960]   bucks a month for a subscription to these things. As it is, I just think that this is a slow,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:43.720]   sloppy and clumsy way of trying to sell me a quote digital version of this piece of artwork
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.640]   that you've already paid your artists for. I'm just not impressed. I've seen it a hundred times
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:54.840]   before and a hundred times it's failed. Interesting article on Apple Matters by Chris Seabold,
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.200]   something we've talked about in the past is Apple neglecting the Mac.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:06.360]   Mac world, there were no new Mac Pro, no new Apple TV, no new Mac Mini, all these things that
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:13.640]   needed to be updated. All they had was a 17-inch MacBook Pro that really wasn't anything great and new.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:24.200]   He's saying at this point, Apple is ignoring the Mac. It's focusing on consumer electronics.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.480]   Well, if they're going from the keynote, we all know that there are a lot of reasons why Apple
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:35.400]   was well-motivated not to show anything really cool at the keynote. Also, historically, or at least
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.080]   for the past couple of years, this January keynote has not been the place where they show off the
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.240]   new iMac or they show off the Reelco through the Mac. Well, they introduced the iMacs there.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:49.640]   Any other year that might have more credence, but this year I'm convinced that if they have
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.920]   something really, really... I almost think that if they were going to show off the new
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.440]   Mac Pro in January, that would sort of mean that, look, we don't really care. This isn't important
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   enough to have it on our stage and try to get the full buffet for the press in for the unveiling.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:09.480]   So here you go, take what you get. It's a year and a half since the Mini was updated. Doesn't it
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.080]   need to be updated? Well, it depends on what you're using it for. I mean, I guess that it's...
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:19.000]   I have a Mac Mini that I use for as a media server and I have to admit, I don't feel like it needs...
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.680]   This is the issue for a lot of computer companies is that I don't feel like I need to upgrade it
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.000]   anytime soon. It's doing what I needed to do right now fairly effectively.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.080]   I have to say there's a new ION platform from NVIDIA that I'm sure Apple will have
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:36.840]   dibs on that really is an exciting platform that would be kind of an interesting choice for the
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:43.960]   Mac Mini or an Apple... an upgraded Apple TV may be more sensible. I think they kind of lost the
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.360]   Mac Mini when the price started entering up. They did. It's got too expensive, didn't it?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.680]   I think that if, again, you get back to that one sentence that they put on the white board
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.560]   when they're deciding what they want to build and they should just put in four letters from left
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:03.640]   to right a dollar sign, $4.99. Do anything you have to do... How do we get there? Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:09.080]   We cannot sell this for $1 more than $4.99. And by the way, there's a $5,000 bonus for each and
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:15.640]   every one of you if we can sell it, build something great for $3.99. I mean, a $6.99 Mac Mini is just
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.840]   not a compelling purchase. Simex says in our chatroom, "I don't think this has to do with Apple wanting
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.960]   to be a consumer company. I think they're waiting for a significant platform or processor upgrades."
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:31.160]   Does that make sense? Also, I would like to think that they're also trying to figure out
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.840]   where they should be going with the Apple TV and the Mac Mini. If it's time to create a $399
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:41.480]   consumer video device that essentially takes place of both of these devices in the product line.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:47.400]   Right. Yeah, I like the Apple TV and everything, but it didn't take me very long. Once I tested
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.880]   a Mac Mini, I immediately moved my media center to the Mac Mini and away from the Apple TV. It was
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:57.240]   just... It had a lot more of what I wanted. The ability just to switch over to Hulu if I wanted
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.600]   to or watch the stuff that I had downloaded or all those things were available on the Mac Mini
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.440]   and weren't available on the Apple TV. The ability to sit there and rip stuff, if I need to.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:11.720]   All that stuff is stuff that I could do with the Mac Mini and not with the Apple TV.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:18.280]   Absolutely. I want the same things too, but it all comes down to how much I'm willing to spend
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.000]   for it. The Apple TV is exactly in the butter zone for what I would spend for a device like that.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   It has to be in the same realm as a Blu-ray player or a good DVD player. Once you start getting to
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.320]   the realm of, you're going to be spending the same amount of money that you would on a good
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:40.120]   netbook or even an okay tower machine that would run on Windows, you start to lose me.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:47.800]   I guess, and I think it depends on the consumer obviously. For me, once I've gotten used to the
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.120]   idea of having a Mac Mini as this media center that holds all my photos and holds my movies and
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:58.360]   holds my... All these other things, the idea of going back, I think it was the best $699 that I spent
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.080]   on any computer. Plus now, a $50 USB stick will buy you enough upgrades for the Apple TV that I can
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:11.480]   get most of the stuff that I would want to use with a Mac Mini as a media server. Given that I've
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:17.240]   got two terabytes worth of video and photos and music on a central server here in my office,
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.720]   I don't necessarily need to duplicate that kind of muscle on a second computer that's underneath my
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:28.680]   TV. We're going to take a break and come back with your product picks of the week in just a second.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.920]   And I also have a couple of announcements I'd like to make. Announcements. Well, one is,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:43.080]   I can mention this right now, the Twistable is coming up on Friday. The Tweet charity drive.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   There's a Twistable events all over the country. T-W-E-S-T-I-V-A-L.com. Not "twestical."
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.680]   Don't miss spell that. It's "twest-devul.com." Is that Thursday? It's Thursday. I'm sorry,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:04.440]   Thursday, the 12th. 175 cities, they're going to be Tweetups, but they're to benefit charity water,
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:11.880]   which is a really great cause to bring potable water to Africa and other areas. And we've made a
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:16.120]   little donation with the help of Jason Calicanis. We're going to donate, I think we're actually
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   going to do two of them. We're going to donate an ad on Twitch. Jason will read it. You'll be
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:30.200]   heard by 175,000 geeks. And we really would love to get those bids up if people are interested in
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:37.800]   doing that. You can bid on that. Let me get you the address to do that because that's pretty
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.120]   exciting. We'll take the ad even if it's just like 60 seconds of him saying the word bum.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:50.840]   It could be any? Yeah. I don't care. If you've got a cum, bum, bum, in 18 different voices,
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.120]   I don't care. Botox.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:55:02.200]   Cosscast.org is the place to go. And that's where the auction is going on. And we would love,
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:06.520]   if you'd love to get a free ad, well, it won't be free, I guess you'll be paying for it. You'll be
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:11.880]   paying to benefit the charity water, of course, but you'll also get an ad on a Twitch as a real
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.200]   salt of it. So I think that's going to be kind of fun. Wonder what happened to Bobby Lou?
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.960]   All right, we're going to get him on here. We're going to get Bobby Lou on here right now here.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:27.080]   Snow. Snow. What kind of wimp? They had the worst snow they've had in Great Britain in,
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:32.920]   I think, several hundred years. Hello. Bobby Lou. You got snowed in?
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.120]   I'm deeply and profound in Barrisosonia and Englishmen could be.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   We had phenomenal snow over the last few days. And I live in a very high area where we had
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:51.080]   really, we had serious snow, like two foot. The roads around here are completely clear. I was
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:56.920]   getting my daughter back from school. Our driveway, which I'd love to show off and say we have this
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:01.720]   huge long driveway to a stately home. It's not very long, but it's about three feet deep in snow.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:08.920]   Our car got stuck. Everything, we got stuck in a pathetic pile of snow. Anyone who comes from the
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:15.080]   midwest or anywhere where it snows properly, like Canada, would be in hysterics, laughing at this
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.040]   pathetic Englishman trying to dig his stupid car out of what is really no more than about four
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.880]   snowballs worth of snow. No, but they get a couple of feet in London. I know it's been a real.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.040]   No, we have had, this is the first snow we've had like this for 25 years. No one knows what to do.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:33.960]   The county I live in, Gloucestershire has no grit or salt left. They're using cooking salt from
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:40.120]   schools to try and salt. It's tragic, but it's just when the people think, and then I was in a sort of
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.880]   panic knowing I had to get back and then I thought, oh no, I've got the time wrong. It's not that bad.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:49.160]   And then I looked at the time when I got back, I went, oh no. So I am really apologetic and I'm
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.800]   really looking forward to it. I've even prepared a list and picks of the week and audible things.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   You can, I'll tell you what, we'll do an audible thing and we're going to do a pick of the week
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.960]   with you. Have you got that far yet? We're just about to get there. So we've done the news and
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:10.040]   we're about to go to the audible and the picks. But I also wanted to mention your new carpool
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.760]   podcast because that is very cool. And Andy and I were talking about that before you got here.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.560]   Tell us what that's all about. Well, I mean, it basically came about when
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:24.680]   quite a few years ago when I was given a lift by another comedian in England, a guy called David
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:31.480]   Baddiel, very funny man who's been on the TV here a lot. And I had a little digital camera with me
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:37.000]   and we just started being, you know, showing off and being silly in a car and in a traffic jam in
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.920]   London. And I stuffed the camera in the corner of the, by the windshield with an old T-shirt and
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:47.560]   just forgot about it. And we just talked. And when we were showing, we were like doing scenes from
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:52.280]   lock stock and two smoking barrels. I love it. So first of all is we're going to do a flag.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:56.520]   We're going to go over there and love the fact. Well, that's not. I mean, we got bored of that
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:01.480]   very quickly. And I forgot, we both sort of forgot the camera was on. And it ran for like an hour,
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.920]   likely, we do want to tape. And it was amazing. Our conversation was that tape now resides in
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.320]   my safe, because neither David or I would ever don't want anyone releasing that one.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.000]   Yeah, definitely not releasing that. But I recently did him on a couple. So anyway,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.840]   what that came about was that's what you do when you're stuck in a car with someone for a long
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.720]   time is you talk. And then I thought, well, if I had my friends and people I know and people I've
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:28.200]   met are interesting, I'll give them a lift somewhere and we'll talk. And it's not an interview. It's
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:34.280]   just two people rapping in a car like you do. And that's all it is. And so I've now got little
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.520]   bullet cams, which I'm constantly upgrading and trying to improve the sound because it's definitely
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:43.720]   the sound is the problem to record sound well in a car. I mean, I drive a Prius, which is, you know,
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.640]   a noise, a lot of petrol heads, but it's very quiet car. So it lends itself. Well, yeah,
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:51.800]   wait a minute, you were driving a Tesla with it. Well, I also, and then I've also given a Tesla.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.480]   Yes, I did two carples. I did one with a comedian called Ruby Wax and American comedian. And
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.040]   also Jonathan Ross, that was in a Tesla. And believe you me, recording two people in a Tesla
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.160]   is not easy because they're not big cars. So the cameras took a bit of lining up for that. But
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.480]   that was fantastic fun. And the Tesla people here have been fantastic. They're very keen to support
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.520]   me. I'm getting a Tesla again. And I shall do a lot more in.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:22.760]   That is on iTunes. You search for carpool and you'll find it in the podcast. It's a video podcast.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:27.240]   There's four so far, but are you going to plan to do these more often? Yes. No, I've recorded
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:32.520]   16 so far. Whoa. And I've been doing them a while and I didn't want to start releasing them
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:37.560]   until I had enough to keep going because they're kind of, you know, in contrast to this show or
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:42.760]   the shows that you do, you kind of have you need a bit of backup. Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm just about
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.080]   to start shooting red dwarf like a remember when I came to talk to about it. We actually start
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.400]   shooting next week. So there's two weeks when there's no way I can give anyone a lift anywhere.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.680]   So, you know, I needed the kind of the backup of material. So I'm releasing them one a week.
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:05.000]   I've got a total of 20 planned. I mean, where I've got people who agreed to do it. So I've done
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.680]   yes, I've done 16 and there's four other people who agreed to do it and I've got them booked in.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.000]   So, you know, at least 20 weeks. I'll do. So that's it. Yeah, Alex, that's a little bit of
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.680]   a little bit about getting things in the pipeline before you start releasing podcasts.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.520]   Always a good, always a good idea to have some. Yeah. Well, that's exciting. Hey, tell us about
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.160]   red dwarf because you, you knew that this reunion was going to happen, but you didn't know much
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.600]   about it when you were in here. Yeah. So you're shooting in two weeks.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.840]   It's shooting in two weeks. Well, no, sorry, we're shooting for two weeks. We start on Monday.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.680]   We've actually done one day is filming. So that I should explain for the American audience who
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:49.080]   may not have seen it. This is a very funny sci-fi, sci-fi sitcom, really, that
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.000]   sort of a sitcom, sort of a sitcom in front of a live audience. Robert played Creighton,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.440]   who is a robot with a rubber face, but a wonderful character, very funny character.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.720]   And how long has this since it's been off the air? Oh, we last one we did was nearly 11 years,
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.320]   1998, the fall of '98 was the last time we shot one. So, yeah, getting on for 11 years. So,
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.680]   the cast have aged, all except for me. No one can tell. You can age. You can age. It's beautiful.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.880]   I've just had a bit of WD-40 and a bit of a scrub down.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:25.000]   You think that after so many years, they would have given you one of those Johnny Ive makeovers.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.560]   You'd be all like, "Whose white sight and smoke glass?" Oh, yeah, you could look like Eve in
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.080]   Wally, you know, all, all the smooth curves. So is the whole cast back?
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.360]   Yeah, it's the main cast exactly the same. I mean, these ones, we're basically making
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:47.080]   effectively, I think, tryouts to say we're doing four episodes and really only,
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.640]   it's a very confusing setup. But we're doing two episodes like we always used to, like proper
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.120]   half-hour sitcoms, lots of gags. Very, they're very, very funny. The scripts are historically
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.000]   funny. And then there's a behind the scenes making of and how Red Dwarf came to be typed,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.440]   like a comedy documentary. And then there's a kind of a hybrid clip show of some sort,
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.280]   which we haven't quite heard the details of yet. I don't quite know what that is.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.840]   So there's really four half hours we're doing. That seems to be just a bit, but we've shot some of
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:20.520]   it already, which was amazing. And we, because I heard about this on, on, on, on
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   twin this week in media, the red camera, we're shooting Red Dwarf on Red Camera.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.960]   Oh, you're kidding. Oh, cool.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.920]   No, it's amazing. And I mean, they are, when I saw the footage played back on that, and they had a big
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.360]   monitor on this, on the set. It's quite scary. I mean, I'm very glad I'm covered in rubber,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.960]   because it's a cruel camera to a man of a certain age.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.840]   Now, who is our Rob Grant and Doug Naylor back writing or?
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.680]   No, no, it's just Doug Naylor who's done it for the, you know, he's done the last.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.160]   Right.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:51.640]   Okay.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.560]   We did all of them effectively, but mostly with Rob. But Rob is very supportive of it,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.800]   but he's not involved anymore. He now writes books, so he doesn't, I mean, he left because he was
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   sick of writing sitcoms, which I can imagine you could get. You know, he did quite a few of them.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.120]   Right.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.760]   Right. So Doug is amazing. So Doug has written the scripts, which are just brilliant. They are
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.240]   so clever. And is the plan to just do these four or do more down the road?
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.760]   I think, I think it's sort of up for grabs. I mean, we were all really surprised by it. And it's
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.040]   been a real battle to find the gap in our schedules, so that we, which match up, because we're all
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.440]   doing other things, you know, so, but we finally managed to do it. And we're all, and once we,
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.800]   you know, we've had one day on set together and it was like we'd never been away.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.480]   That's the same, the same old jokes, the same tricks I fell for the same practical jokes immediately.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.440]   Great fun. I mean, it's easy to trick a guy in a rubber face. It's not that hard to
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.000]   robot suits. Or the sets a lot are the sets similar to what they were in the originals show.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.760]   Because I've got to be really careful because I've signed an NDA.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.680]   Oh, but I think, well, I have to say that. Yes, I think I'm allowed to say that the way it's
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.400]   green screen. It's really interesting. Oh, interesting. Fantastic. Really cutting edge stuff. I've seen.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.000]   With the red camera, you can do, I'm sure Alex could weigh in on this, but
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.200]   we've done a lot of green screen. The higher quality of the camera, the better the green screen.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.760]   Is that right? Yeah, I mean, you could definitely do it all. I mean, that's the way I would do it
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.840]   nowadays is to do it all green screen. So it's, that's fantastic. And what channel is it on in the UK?
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.960]   It's on Channel Dave, which is a cable channel, which has become amazingly popular and has shown
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.720]   repeats of Red Dwarf a lot. In fact, shows just about every TV show I've ever worked on
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.240]   is on Dave. It's the kind of boys channel, I suppose. Right, you could call it.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.880]   And it's becoming this amazingly popular channel. It's extraordinary because I think
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.520]   I'm trying to be very diplomatic here, but I've talked to people in the TV industry and they
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.440]   said channel day is very important when you don't want to watch a program. When, when there's, if
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.120]   there's someone watching TV who doesn't want to watch a program about what you should wear or how
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:55.000]   big your bum looks in something, you need. And there's, we've got a lot of those programs, how
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.040]   you cook what you cook. There's about 5000 celebrity chefs in England. We're just the whole every
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:05.720]   time you go out shopping has 10 celebrity chefs in the store, you know. So there is a kind of
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.280]   quite a thirst for something other than cookery and clothes and interior decorating.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.080]   But you know, I've gone too far really.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:22.760]   And I'm seeing on, if you go to Dave.uktv.co.uk, you can see the first image of the Red Dwarf cast
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   back together again. And there you are in your suit. You look exactly the same.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.000]   It doesn't look much different, does it? No.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.680]   It's quite shocking. Is it the same suit? No, it is a new suit. I think the, because I've
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:43.160]   actually slightly lost about an inch around my waist in 10 years. Oh, I hate you. Oh, I know.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:49.000]   And I've been, I have to admit, I've been trying recently. I've been trying to lose it. So,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.080]   but only an inch, not that much. So, but yes, it's a pretty much the same.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.880]   A new slimmed down suit. Well, very, yeah, you wouldn't really notice. But there are some very
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:04.680]   cruel pictures of Creighton in his slightly porky mid around the mid 1990s when I was having a lot
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:10.440]   of lunch. And two shows, there's a slightly more porky Creighton, though, tended not,
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.840]   I never wanted to stand sideways in front of the camera.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.320]   All right. I love it. So let's do the audible and, and since you've prepared a pick,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.840]   Robert will, we'll, we'll let you do a pick.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:31.240]   Yeah. And lutube, by the way, is L L E W T U B E comments, another place to see carpool,
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:39.560]   right? That's right. So audible brings us this fine show, this interlude with Bob Llewellyn and
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.000]   the entire cast and crew of Mac Break Weekly. Audible is a great place to get audio books.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.680]   It's available in the UK, but usually the books we talk about are US only or the US versions,
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:56.600]   audible.com/macbreak. But I know there's a big contingent of audible fans in the UK.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.880]   Did you, have you read any books up for Audible?
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.920]   Yes, I have. There's quite a few of mine on there that I've done.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:08.520]   Some reason I'm only allowed to do children's ones. I've not been allowed to do a grownup
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.760]   books yet. Oh, is, I'm, because when I record them, I record them with, through the BBC,
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:18.600]   that the BBC has a sort of audio book section. And then when I, you're all in these little
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:24.680]   studios, a big row of them. And Stephen Fry recorded Harry Potter there, you know, so they do all
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:30.440]   those books, all the big, rich. And there's these wonderful old Thesps who are reading, you know,
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.360]   Jane Austen and things like that. And we all have lunch together.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.320]   What is fun. And they say, what are you reading? Well, I'm reading Jane Austen. What are you reading?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.480]   Oh, I'm reading Harry Potter. What are you reading, Bobby?
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.600]   I'm reading, I tell you what I'm reading. I'm reading the, the, the, the, the dummies of
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:55.240]   Alistair Fury, which are very funny, which are aimed at sort of 11 to 14 year olds about a snotty
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.640]   English school boy who hates his brother and sister and his mum's a TV chef and he can't
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.400]   stand the food she cooks. And they're very fine. Wonderful writer called Jamie Ricks,
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.800]   who I've been friends as many years. So I've done, oh, 10, 10 of his books. I think, and then
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.600]   loads of other different children books. I think I've done 25, 30 books altogether over the years.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:17.240]   Wow, I really do. Oh, that's. They're not, they're not all on audio, but they're audible. But I know
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.000]   these are all on a book.co.uk. So they may not be available. No, I'm looking on the USA and all
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.320]   the Alistair Fury books are. Yeah. Alfonso Bonzo is on there. Alfonso is fantastic. Yeah. The
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:34.520]   Ratistroft catastrophe or the, the Ritasophy catastrophe, the ill more chronicles book one.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   Very funny book. Yeah. Well, that's cool. Well, so, so we have six of your books on Audible US.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.160]   We unfortunately do not have Stephen Fry's version of Harry Potter. We have Jim Dale,
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.520]   who's quite wonderful. But he's very good. You know what I did? I have to confess on the last book.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.920]   I'd been listening to Jim Dale all along. I, I went somewhere to download and managed to
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   download Stephen Fry's version. Is it, is it a, oh, it's marvelous. No, why can't we have that?
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.200]   Because, and this is, this is what we talk about a lot on Audible. Every country has different
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:09.560]   publishing rights. So Scholastic publishes Harry Potter in the US. They contract with Jim Dale.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.640]   And if you're in the US, you have to have the Jim Dale version. It's Penguin in, I think it's
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.480]   Penguin in the UK. And so you, and they contracted with Stephen Fry and you have to get the Stephen
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.440]   Fry version. Have to. It's not the right word. The Stephen Fry version is as good as Jim Dale is.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.320]   You can't beat Stephen Fry. Can you help him get, can you help us get Stephen Fry in one of our shows?
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.120]   Bob. I mean, I can, I can certainly try. I'm doing, I'm carpooling him in April. He's all out.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.440]   He's going to be out of the country here soon. Yeah. He's doing a movie, I think. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.040]   Pabble so much. So, but he's agreed to do a couple. So if not before then, certainly then,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.960]   I'll go goodness sake. Tell him, tell him about Twit. Because I don't think he knows what Twit is.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.960]   And if he may not know, because I think he's getting a lot of Twitter saying you should be on
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.360]   Twit. And I think he's taking it in the wrong way, frankly.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.800]   But it was also when he, because I don't know him at all, I met him a few times and we in fact,
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.080]   Red Dwarf used to rehearse next to Blackadder. Oh, how far? When they rehearsing the last series
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.840]   of Blackadder, you were in the next room. Oh, to be a fly on the wall and that's to do.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.760]   Yeah. Oh, I never did go in, but I mean, I did used to look through the window and sneak a look in.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.280]   Because I mean, I was very, I've been friends with Ben Elton, one of the writers of Blackadder for
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   years before we used to do stand-up comedy together. So there's a lot of people in that show I knew.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.320]   I didn't know Stephen, but I met him at that time. And I met him a few times. He's such a
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.640]   fantastic leader. I love him. Wonderful man. I'll tell you what I was listening to while I was
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   plowing through the snow was his, he just recorded this recently, which I think is going to,
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.840]   he's certainly on iTunes, is him, I think that they do the Apple Store in London called Meet the
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.920]   Author. And that's, I've just done only that. And it's just him telling the history of
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.960]   computing. He bought the very, one of the very first Apple wax in England.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.360]   Yeah. He got the number one with Doug. He got number two, Doug's Adam's got number one.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.000]   And he bought it, the one, the first laser printer he did buy. We had to have just
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.720]   heard this just for a K-men, just seven and a half thousand pounds.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.520]   The first laser printer. I had one of those and it was, you know, it was good fun to lift that thing.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.720]   Yes, it was huge. Anyway, so I've just been hearing that. So that's all actually very funny and very
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:20.280]   knowledgeable. Even if he talks rubbish, you believe it because he's just got that accent.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.320]   It's that accent that does it. Well, I want to recommend the Robert Llewellyn readings of
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:32.920]   Alistair Fury or Alfonso Bonzo or the Ritastrophe Catastrophe. Those are unaudible and those
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.520]   could be our audible picks. We'll make those our audible picks for the week since Bob is on with us
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.320]   right now. Audible.com/MacBreak. Get your free book when you sign up. And don't forget,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.840]   this is the last few days to get the seven habits of highly effective people, the Stephen
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.280]   Covey book. That is free, absolutely free to Audible members past and new, but all you have
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.000]   to do is go to audible.com/twithabits. And that's only good through the 15th. So you have
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.520]   just a few more days to get that audible.com/twithabits. Good through February 15th, absolutely free.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.960]   So let us get our picks and I'll tell you what, Bob, you probably have stuff to do. We'll let
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.480]   you do yours first and then we'll let you go. Okay. I mean, I'm fine now. Oh, are you?
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.640]   No, no, no, no. You could be with us. Well, I'll still let you, a pride of place. I'll let you go first.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.920]   I'm concerned now that this is a previous pick, but I've not heard you talk about it because I'm a
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.160]   regular listener. A thing I've just come across and I've just been playing with it today. So it's
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.760]   very appasite. It's called pathfinder. Do you know about pathfinder? Yes, I love pathfinder.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.000]   I mean, I've just started using it. I just think this is brilliant. I love this thing.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.320]   Version five just came out a couple of months ago. Tell us about pathfinder. Why don't you like
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.800]   pathfinder? Well, what it is is basically a finder. It's the same as the finder because I was quite
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.960]   nervous about opening. I thought, well, it moved all my files somewhere because I am not a tidy
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:02.280]   fileer on my Macs. Because I'd run two computers and sort of sync them in a sort of really bad way.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.840]   This has really helped because for one thing, in one window, you can have more than one
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:14.200]   column of files in your computer and you can move them and compare them. And that's what's been
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   really brilliant for me is to go, hang on, I've got this, all the duplicates I've got of things.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.120]   I open the copy and the backup copy and the other backup copy and I can see them all
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.320]   in a round and go, I can delete that and that and I move that one then. That hasn't got the copy.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:35.000]   That it just makes using the finder 10 times easier. And I mean, I would imagine it's going to be
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.200]   one of those programs that in a future iteration of the Mac software, you'll be able to do this.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   It's a very, very simple thing and it seems to be very light on the computer. It doesn't slow it
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.440]   down, it doesn't mess things up, it doesn't, you know, there's a lot of programs you can run that,
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:55.000]   I just ditch because I think that's grinding everything to a halt. But this seems to just float very
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.520]   easily on the surface of it and all it does is help you move files around. It's like exactly the
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.120]   same as the finder but it gives you hundreds of more options and things to do and I've just
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.440]   started digging into it and I'm really impressed with what it does and it seems stable. It hasn't
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.800]   crashed anything, you know, it does seem very good. So that's my knowledge. My knowledge of what it
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.880]   does is still fanning them. It's I've been literally using it in between editing today.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:24.200]   No, it's fantastic. I've used it for us for some time and I don't use it all that I don't use it
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.440]   all the time. I end up going back to finder Andy, you like you like Pat was it you or was it Merlin
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.760]   who was a big Pathfinder fan? Yeah, I think I've made it pick like a while ago but and yeah, I still
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:38.440]   I still use it. I don't install it on every one of my machines but it is an absolute essential
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.920]   for that one big Mac that has though that again that's big two terabyte hard drive and the one
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.480]   terabyte work drive on it because I mean it's just like Robert was saying if you just need to figure
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:53.880]   out oh god which one of this aren't you very clever Andy to to to label this to name this
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:15:01.080]   document start of third novel. Wow. It makes sense at the time. I'm sure I've got eight different
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.720]   copies of this done over the past year as I try to figure out what the third novel is going to be
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.520]   about. Yes, another productive day Andy but yeah I mean when you try to figure out oh but that's
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.240]   in a subfolder of this subfolder that I copied from this flash drive it just is like power
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.720]   steering for the finder. Of course it's not an add on to the finder it is the finder. It's
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:26.040]   definitely on that list of you know if I had the right contact at Apple I would say look surely
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.200]   you have enough money to just give this man enough money to put a damn smile on his face
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:35.560]   alas the rest of his life and buy this and I agree plus it's all in cocoa right so it's not
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.400]   you know unlike the real finder which is in carbon. Yeah I really think that what I would love is if
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.840]   the just like and so many elements of like iPhone interfaces and and dashboard interfaces
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.440]   you know how like there's a way you can click a button and the whole thing just with open
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   the whole thing just like rotates and flips over to the other side I would love it if we had like
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.680]   the nice simple finder that we have for normal tasks but there's a way to simply say with a big
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.960]   heaving of gears and a slam of metal against metal it flips over and now you have the power finder
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.440]   for well that's exactly what one of the reasons I don't use it because it is the real finder keeps
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.920]   launching itself and then now I'm confused because I've got both kind of going at the same time it's
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:19.960]   very confusing so Pathfinder 5 is as now it's a $20 upgrade for previous owners and $40 if you
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:26.360]   haven't purchased it but you can try before you buy and by the way I I just looked at your site
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:36.200]   the new lu tube yeah I speaking of the finder yes you've done it in in system 7 for fashion
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.560]   I think it's could even be before that I mean it just reminds me because I used to have a I had
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:47.720]   an I've still got it an se 220 that was my first man oh man did 1988 or 89 so this is a word press
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.000]   theme I love it yeah but it was just as soon as I'm sorry I went that you know I may change it but
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.640]   at the moment I just think oh no no no it's my generation it's it's perfect it is fantastic in fact
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.400]   I like the little bomb at the bottom and everything yes but the whole we've got the works yeah yeah
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:11.480]   and it all works you know the files if you click on a file it opens yay that's where you'll find the
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.760]   red dwarf fact and yeah yes and more and I'm jealous that I didn't think of that first isn't that a
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.560]   great it's really really great oh and he's even you know he's got the he's got the you know carpool
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.520]   playing in a window there it looks like uh I don't know it's it's a little disorienting to have the
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:31.880]   21st century in Pinge on my yes isn't quite right you kind of have to have it like really
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   uh like that cinepak nasty looking thing yeah right can you pixelate it just yeah yeah oh I think
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.120]   it's more like that scene in the Wizard of Oz where Dorothy steps out from the black and white
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:49.400]   world world of canvas and dog my pick actually is something that I've been using for a long time
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:57.240]   on Firefox and I'm a big fan of I have Firefox versions on Macs on windows on multiple machines
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:05.240]   and I've been using a program called Fox Marks F O X M A R K S dot com to synchronize the bookmarks
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.600]   in all my Firefox and it's and it's just it's like the first thing I install now when I sit down
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.160]   on a new computer I put Firefox on it and I put Fox marks on it Mitch Cape or by the way started
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.880]   this company it's kind of interesting the guy who wrote Lotus 123 13 million downloads now available
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:29.160]   for Safari so this is even better if you are using Safari and Firefox if you're not using
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.320]   Firefox at all but I use both and it's keeps all my bookmarks in sync between all of my browsers
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.920]   even works with Internet Explorer for those poor people still using Internet Explorer who uses
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.560]   that I don't know somebody must because they made it work for it this is an amazing program on
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:49.160]   Firefox it also syncs your passwords that does not seem to yet be working on Safari probably
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:55.800]   because they're very different absolutely free at zero Alex's it is an it is in my opinion a must
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   on any browser it's called Fox Marks F O X M A R K S dot com the essential bookmarking out on
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:11.000]   I'd agree now not just for Firefox anymore Andy and not co your pick my friend I actually have
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.120]   two selections available via analog pulp tree substrate complex substrate two books books
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:29.480]   books what you're in your happy place Leo not audio books not Kindle books paper books I just
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.520]   think those rainforests have been getting pretty cocky lately with all those sting concerts supporting
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.160]   them and I think time to show them who's boss again but yeah actually I've got two books that are
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:45.000]   sort of like a seven out of ten on the geek scale one is from a name that a lot of people will be
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.880]   very very excited about Dave Mark has this ungodly ability to reduce the most complicated
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.360]   lessons of programming into a way that makes you think that you can write Macintosh software he wrote
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.960]   a he wrote the book that taught me objectives how to write modern see he did a series called
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:08.440]   learn see on the Mac learn Pascal on the Mac when objective see on the Mac and it's I'm just I'm
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:15.640]   just blown away by by the ability to take something so complicated and reduce it to a series of very
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:21.160]   very painfully carefully explained steps that leaves you sitting sitting there in the train
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.200]   reading this book thinking that you've written this piece of software that you've just seen
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.080]   described and feeling as though gee this this demo piece of software that he's describing is
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:33.400]   kind of similar to a piece of software I would like to actually write myself I bet that I'm now
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.600]   93 percent towards building it now it's not now the book that he's recently come out with is
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.240]   co-authored with a guy by the name of Jeff Lamarch it's called beginning iPhone development
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:49.640]   exploring the iPhone SDK and it is just remarkable I actually have written two iPhone applications
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:54.680]   with it I did I did download the SDK when it first came out a while ago and I played with it and
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.160]   I did I made the breathtaking step of creating a demo application that instead of saying hello
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:07.000]   world says hello Andy so big there but yeah it takes you through all kinds of complicated
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.920]   concepts and again if you want to write the if you want to write the next best-selling flatulence
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:18.360]   application by page number 98 of this 500 page book you're definitely there but as I said it's
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.880]   now it's not an absolute beginner's book if you've never programmed before I don't want to make you
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:27.160]   think that you know this is this is your first step towards towards Zana Du like glory but if you
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.560]   are at all familiar with programming if you've written any software of any kind including apple
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.440]   script including python including pearl that sort of stuff like I said you can even just sit on the
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.800]   sofa and read through this and just as just as a fun little exercise and I guarantee you that
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:47.400]   just like me I mean I got to page like 30 something there in my kitchen and I was like holding the
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:53.240]   book open running back into my office to launch the SDK to start like playing with iPhone software
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.440]   development I mean Dave Mark is really one of the giants he really is a treasure in in Macintosh
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:04.840]   book writing and I just hope he keeps turning these things out now the second one there is our
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.640]   version of Chinese democracy here in Macintosh technical book writing that the thing that we always
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.280]   known has been in the pipeline for years and we never let our hearts believe that this thing could
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:18.520]   actually ever be released because our hearts are weak feeble things and we've had them broken so
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.400]   many times for this project in in hushed rumor tones we have been told that
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:29.640]   south segoyan was working on a book on apple script ten years ten years ten years ten years
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.480]   ten years i think i think that he was actually pulling sort of a microsoft fear and certainty
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.400]   and doubt sort of thing because there are times when i've had i do because there's never been an
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:45.560]   apple script book worth half a dam not even a full dam not even half a dam and i've always thought
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.360]   jeez i love apple script and i do a lot of apple script i've written uh i wrote my first blogging
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.840]   application in 1994 entirely of via apple script and i kept updating it until just a year and a half
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.080]   ago i love apple script i think it's a great great facility that everybody should really learn
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.560]   but i've always thought oh i want to write this book but sal's going to come out with his book any
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.960]   day now and it's going to be brilliant and i'm going to have to people are going to ask me what's so
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:14.840]   great about my book and i'll say well um because maybe you have fifty dollars to spend on books
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:18.920]   and maybe sal's book only costs thirty dollars and you have to spend the rest of that money
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.800]   i'll take your twenty dollars uh so it just it was released at mackerel expo just a few weeks ago i
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:28.120]   got my copy just a couple of weeks ago and it is everything that i would have hoped it was going
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.760]   to be it will take you from square one even if you have never written piece a piece of software before
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:39.000]   it starts from very very basic concepts and builds up from there it emphatically makes the
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.280]   statement that the difference between being a really really good user of mac and toches and being
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:50.520]   a godlike power user is having a good understanding of this scripting language that sits underneath
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.920]   the operating system at all places and in case you don't you know some of them might be three of our
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.240]   listeners who don't know who sells to go in is he is a product manager for apple apple script and
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:05.720]   automation at apple he is the iron chef of apple script he is he's and he's not the iron chef you
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:10.040]   want to go up against if it involves completing a process and anything less than three hours on
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.560]   the mac because he can just toss out four lines of code that does it collapses a four day production
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:21.320]   feed into just double click on this one icon and an apple script will do it for you uh so and one
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.600]   of these we you know sal is is now becoming one of our features of of mac break dev which is another
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:33.320]   mac break video show that we have out and uh every time sal is in the studio recording mac break devs
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:38.120]   on using automator and apple script uh it just makes me want to go run run back to my computer
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.800]   and start automating everything you know and and every time now i i think of every time doing
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:49.000]   something two or three times in a row that's anywhere near similar to what i did before i just i think
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.480]   of sal and i think i i really should be writing an automator script here or i should should be
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.640]   writing apple script here is an idea of how old this book is a sal's picture on the front is an
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:05.880]   asky art i'm not kidding well no it's it's come on it's it's not that old he did it with thunder scan
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.160]   on on his brother i think you're absolutely right this is the book i mean there's just
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.600]   no question about it and i don't know why it took so long to get it out like because because he
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.480]   still works for apple and yeah and the fact that the fact that you got this from the fact that we
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.240]   got this that it came out at all is just amazing that it got to apple it does have the apple logo on
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:30.120]   it it's apple part of the apple training series and it has the apple certified quality logo of
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.080]   quality except no substitutes so i'm guessing that lawyers then lawyers lawyers than the lawyers who
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.400]   advise the lawyers who rule the lawyers had a take a look at the manuscript before it came out
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.480]   but uh i mean definitely it just goes to show you that you don't mind a delay if the results are
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.440]   this good this is this is the sort of thing where this is the reason why now finally the starting
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:54.120]   gun has been has been fired now finally when i finish reading this i can say okay there is a topic
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:59.480]   about itunes scripting and interfacing with our do we know that he did not talk about there's my
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.760]   opportunity to finally write an apple script book because there's something that he did not cover
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:09.240]   in his book archie we know the complete archie we know book uh good choices couple of great picks
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.000]   thank you any of that fantastic finally Alex Lindsey with his pick of the week so um so my pick of the
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.640]   week is currently zero Alex's although someday it may cost something but right now there is a beta
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:29.160]   out of so i i grew up learning not grew up but in my early 3d years i used a program called form z
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.160]   yeah and i love form z and uh but it was one of those things that it had become heavy and and you
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.240]   know and for what we did it was hard to you know to cad program kind it was a little bit of a
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.040]   cad program and and it just the interface hadn't really progressed with with everything else and
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.840]   and i you know now i model a lot of stuff in moto i sketch stuff out in google sketch up i build
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.840]   3d stuff in cinema 4d these are all programs that i use on the mac a lot um to put the stuff together
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:03.560]   but but autodesis who who makes form z uh is uh they put out a new program called bond zi 3d
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:12.360]   and that's bond zi b-o-n-z-a-i uh 3d and this is it almost feels like google sketch up so it when
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.760]   you look at it and when you look at the ease of use of just throwing some stuff together uh it
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.840]   almost feels like that that kind of organic i'm just going to draw a box i'm going to pop another
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.920]   box out of it i'm going to move stuff around uh except that it the tools are much much deeper
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.640]   so it's sitting on top of a nerves interface it's sitting you know you can round things much
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.200]   easier the booleens actually work uh these are all things that a lot of programs you know forms
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.720]   zi's been the best at for a long time and and this is pretty impressive so you get this great
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.800]   easy to use interface and i'm just getting it literally came out yesterday i think or the day
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.000]   before is it forms e compatible and file for i think it is well it'll it'll export all kind
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.880]   all kinds of formats so it'll export uh it'll actually import from the google sketch up in some
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.680]   way i mean it's free this it's a beta so right now it's a beta right now it'll last 30 days when
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.600]   you download it i don't know what's happening after that because they're just tech this is a public
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.640]   beta uh and it's but i i you know if you if you just want to play with something that it it i've
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.880]   i've been surprised at how much they put into it because i keep on looking at old tool looking for
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.280]   old tools that i used in form z and i can't believe that they're actually there you know that and uh
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:24.440]   says all the classic modeling tools yeah and it's it's uh and and this is something that uh you know
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.800]   i talked compatible with google earth and sketch up yeah so you can down you can import stuff from
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.600]   there i think you can export stuff back out to google sketch up it's just that but it's a much more
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.760]   uh robust feature set than what you're gonna see in google now it's there are things i think
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.600]   google sketch up is still probably just a little easier to just throw stuff together but as soon
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   as you want to make a model that's a little bit more complicated uh that requires you know there's
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.840]   there's 20 steps that you'll do it in google sketch up and that's what you pay for for the
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.160]   simplicity of google sketch up you'll do it in 20 steps in forms that you'll do or in bronze i
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.400]   3d you'll do it in two right um this isn't replacing the other stuff that i already have i mean i
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.640]   love moto i love cinema 40 i love google sketch up this is just another tool in that toolbox
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:09.560]   but i think that if you really want to um see something that you can play with for free uh that
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.680]   you can um you know and it's still gonna you know it's a public beta so there'll be still some
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:19.800]   stability issues here and there but uh it is a very very powerful uh modeler uh surprisingly and i
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.880]   think that they're gonna come out i don't know what affordable means to them when they uh you know
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.160]   when they say that here but i'm you know they they haven't landed on a price point yet for this
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.280]   but i'm guessing that it's gonna actually be something you can afford once they get to the other
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.800]   end of it um the original version of forms you that i used was like fifteen hundred dollars so um so
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:43.080]   i think it's gonna be significantly less uh when they you know than that and so uh as i said it's
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.600]   free right now i would highly suggest um you know people download it play with it uh i'm probably
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.360]   going to do a couple little videos just because um there's probably some stuff hidden in there that
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.680]   the average person wouldn't no i'm just excited because it's you know form z was my old friend
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:02.520]   and i and i and while i i model in a lot of other things the the thing that i you know built stuff for
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.640]   star wars in that i built you know the heaviest models i've ever built was in form z and so
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.960]   having something that's a little easier with a little better interface that still has those old
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:19.400]   tools is kind of like a an old warm blanket for me so anyway bonsai 3d it's with z uh check it out
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:24.840]   very cool very cool well we've we've we've come to the end but i have to say we saved the two best
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:31.800]   stories for last just for you i think bobby loo uh one at one is uh you made me think of it Alex when
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.480]   you were talking about the uh rather uh Andy when you're talking about the iPhone developer
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:40.440]   program did you see the strip at the nine-year-old who's got an iPhone application on the uh
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:47.400]   out of singapore store nine years old it's a doodle program that really um it makes me feel
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:54.040]   like i'm just like uh i better get to work yeah uh has he been programming for a long time i'm
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.680]   jumping hard trying to find the story here just pretty impressive well obviously not that long
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:05.080]   i've been programming for a long time i learned to read i learned to read in x code
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:11.000]   yeah i'm just thinking of the the outliers a theory of the ten thousand hours of practice
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.120]   he didn't have that he's well we don't know if he's a boy do we know if the boy or
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.080]   girls i think it's a boy i'm trying to find uh i've lost the story i had it right here right i mean
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:24.600]   yes i mean you know you just think of that boy that boy in ten years time when he's 19 my goodness
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:28.600]   that is extraordinary isn't his name is his name is his name is girls don't worry he'll get
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:36.440]   derailed i think it's a boy his name is lim ding when and uh he uh wrote doodle kids uh program
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.760]   that lets iphone users draw with their fingers by touching the iphones touch screen and then
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:46.280]   clear the screen by shaking the phone works on the touch he says i wrote the program for my
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:53.080]   younger sisters three and five who like to draw wow because they haven't figured out open gl yet
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:58.520]   they can only do text things yeah he he's i'm the big brother i have to help them out he's fluent
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:04.360]   in six programming languages his dad is a computer scientist of course
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:09.880]   i have some booth somewhere in the house i just don't remember what he started learning programming
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:19.400]   at the age of seven oh on apple two gs oh man he also writes in action script and java script
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:26.040]   apple soft basic g-soft basic pascal or capascal and a little objective c oh man
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.440]   right he's gonna have to do some homework on that objective c it's just not right it's a great
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:35.640]   brush up there's a great picture of him on his web page in an elmo shirt he's kind of
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:43.320]   it's kind of i don't know i uh you don't have a street address i think they might want to send
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:48.120]   some resumes out i think we want to hire this kid and then the other story and you broke this story
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:52.520]   i think it certainly uh the first time i saw it was your twitter andy and anaco and i couldn't
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:58.440]   credit it at the time but now i've seen confirmation that in the next dancing of the stars one of the
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:05.400]   stars who will be dancing is our very own steve wasniak this doesn't seem possible
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:12.440]   well he's he's the the good news is that there are like two or three categories of people who show
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:18.520]   up on this program and i think he's in there in the category of like the former olympic boxers and
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:24.760]   like other other ceos where it's not it's not a damn disgrace that they're on this show because
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.840]   they're just out for a few weeks of fun they're not supposed to be in the entertainment business to
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:34.200]   begin with so this is just a big break from the actual good productive work they're doing it's
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.400]   when the person who was getting twenty million dollars a picture ten years ago and just never
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.800]   needs that needs that fifteen thousand dollars to make the next mortgage payments yeah that's kind
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.920]   of this with a segue what is the deal i mean he's not exactly in the best shape i don't think
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:55.240]   well let's all see the now see the the thing is though i did start looking back i got
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.320]   uh i let listen to his listen to us on his team here
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:05.160]   he's he's going to be competing against lt lerence taylor of the former new york giant and hall of
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:13.000]   famer belinda carlile of the go-go's little kim danish richards david allen grier
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.600]   comedian uh gillis marini who was the neighbor uh uh the cute neighbor on uh in the movie sex in
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.520]   the city you know the one you saw more and i don't think you ever saw him with clothes on as a matter
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:34.200]   of fact uh stevo of wild boys and tv host nancy odel of access hollywood it's going to be intense
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.960]   it's a little down market this time around
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.120]   i guess i should take that back so it was a little bit me describing other people that other people
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.520]   that way but it seems it's it seems like they got an interesting group and not not as not as
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:52.600]   interesting as when pendula was on no that was that was the ultimate what the hell is he doing on
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:59.160]   dancing what is a six foot seven juggler doing on a tv dance show well why is it be if i i guarantee
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.000]   there's going to be a segue in there somewhere there's no this this is this is the ultimate like
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.720]   match game question you know steve wasniak went on dancing with the stars but it was a little
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.120]   different how different is it that i'm dancing in shoes he danced with a blank
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.880]   four out of six would be the segue but the two other two would be pretty damn filthy
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.760]   bobby lu great to talk to you i'm so glad red dwarf is coming back you're taping starting
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.680]   monday do you know when those first shows will appear on channel dave in on a on april the 10th

[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.840]   be a travesty something something's just have to stay the same just you just can't change

[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:55.800]   sent me an email saying you know we should get a bus and go down to south by south west stop in
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.840]   the towns along the way and do podcasts the whole way and uh he says he's gonna foot some of the

[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:12.200]   you said i love you i love you i love you i can i i think it'd be fun we could play guitar in the
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.840]   bus sing so we're gonna we're gonna investigate that if Jason wants to do it i think that'd be kind
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:22.840]   of a lot of fun be very very interesting but anyway we'll we'll let you know more about that
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.640]   only if every time you stop in you get involved in a local controversy and you help people see the
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.840]   glory of god or you drive a big truck through like a drug den or something something walker
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.400]   tech this ranger or tux spry angel or highway to heaven we give we could give him a little uh
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:42.680]   a little every show every show ends with you making your lonely hitchhiking way with a
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.400]   duffel bag over your shoulder as the peony music plays as you walk into the sunset by the way we
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.480]   will not buy the bus but it turns out you can rent him fairly cheap like three three hundred
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.520]   fifty dollars a day it's pretty good price that includes a driver but you have to put the driver
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:02.760]   up at night that's that's a great deal yeah he's got he's how big is it's a tour bus yeah what so
