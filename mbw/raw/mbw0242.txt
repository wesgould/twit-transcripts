[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.200]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.240]   We are at the NAB show, the National Association
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080]   of Broadcasters Show in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.920]   for the week covering the latest in Pro Gear.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920]   And a good place to do MacBreak Weekly,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   because there's a lot of interesting Pro Gear.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.640]   Apple may not be here, but there's
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   a lot of interesting Apple-centric gear.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120]   Joining me, of course, Alex Lindsey, who
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   wouldn't miss an NAB ever.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.520]   It's good to have you.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.840]   16th NAB.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   Nice to have you.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   Someone else was talking about 23.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.360]   Kirk was talking 23.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   I was like, I wonder how many times I've actually
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.080]   been here.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.580]   Wow.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.080]   You can't end it up.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.760]   16.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.680]   That's really great.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.040]   Of course, Andy can't join us, because we
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.360]   don't have Skype capability on the road,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.240]   but we've got a great Andy anyway.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.800]   Andy Beach, who is a chief evangelist for Seawail Networks,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.040]   and is a wizard in compression.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080]   That's-- I'm a video geek from way back.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.920]   The king of compression is here.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800]   Maybe the Duke.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.400]   And I presume-- I mean, I have to ask--
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.880]   a Mac user.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.360]   Very much.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   I speak all languages, but if I'm doing video production,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   it's all about the Mac.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   You know, that's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.800]   I mean, the Mac is--
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.320]   or at least is until later today--
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   the king of video production.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   Yeah, I mean, it's just so easy.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.880]   Like, you can absolutely do it on the others if you have to,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.320]   but that's really the choice.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.160]   You have to.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.660]   Right.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.960]   Whereas it just becomes much easier
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   to be able to handle it when you're dealing with the Apple.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.880]   But here's the question.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.640]   And this is the rumor.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.120]   I keep hearing as I walk around.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.600]   First of all, the final cut user group meeting is today,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.320]   right, Alex?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.680]   Yes.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.400]   It is a big deal.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.720]   Yeah, it's always a big deal.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.160]   I mean, the super meet is always something
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.440]   where you have 1,000 final cut users.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   Many of them working in the business.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.400]   And they're not just--
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.880]   We've found cutters has grown into something that is not--
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.160]   is no longer something used by--
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.960]   And when it first started, it was really almost a hobby by Apple.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.460]   Right.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.760]   And then when Walter Murch used it in Cold Mountain,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.000]   it became-- it started to really infiltrate the industry.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And now it's everywhere.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.800]   I mean, you see reporters using it with their laptops
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.000]   in the Middle East and all those things.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's just everywhere.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Right.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.520]   And they were going to have Kevin Smith and a bunch of people
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.120]   talking, but the plan changed.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   Last week, they said we don't--
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.000]   we are going to have a special guest.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.360]   And we were told-- we were supposed to be the streaming
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.080]   partner, so we were actually going to do the stream for them.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.880]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.080]   And we were told last minute that, yeah, we're not
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.480]   going to do a stream.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.440]   So there's no way to watch this event?
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   No.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.480]   No, it's not-- so it's going to be semi-private.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.320]   No one is saying anything about what's actually
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.640]   going to be talked about, but everyone's assuming
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.880]   that what we're going to see is someone very high up at Apple
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520]   talking about final cut.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's the assumption.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.680]   That's interesting.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   Because we've been waiting for the next version of final cut.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.680]   It's a long time.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.000]   For--
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.480]   For how long?
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.960]   Two years?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.960]   Two years.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.720]   That was the last major update.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.040]   There was a minor update last year,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.640]   but it was just bug-fixed.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520]   Does it feel like it's overdue?
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.680]   Oh, I mean, yeah.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.400]   I mean, the biggest part of it, really,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.880]   has been that it's still a 32-bit app,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.080]   and running on 64-bit operating system.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   And I know I can feel it when I load it now.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.320]   And it's not like I have to edit that much anymore,
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.720]   so I can't believe people who have to use it day to day.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Well, we use it day to day, and it works fine.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   But it would also explain the delay,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.360]   because it takes a while.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.520]   I mean, it takes a non-trivial.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.240]   It takes so long to import something.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   Like you're rewriting the entire application, really.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.520]   Well, and that's what-- the rumors that have gone around--
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   This is what's scary.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.200]   And let me talk about the rumors.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.040]   This is scary.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.240]   Well, you talk about the rumors.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.760]   It sounds like-- I've talked to several people who said,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.920]   there's real concern that Apple's going to dumb it down.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.920]   It's going to be another iMovie shift in user interface.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.760]   And I'm hearing from a lot of professional users
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   who are very concerned about this.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.600]   I think they are.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   I think that there is a--
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.460]   it does sound like they've rethought a lot of pieces
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.640]   that they've incorporated it.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   You don't know.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   Have you seen it?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.600]   I have not seen it.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.200]   I have not seen it.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.080]   I have not.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.960]   Everybody who has seen it has been extremely type-lipped.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.640]   I mean, you know, they--
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   Yeah, they go--
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.080]   Yeah, it was jaw-dropping.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   But you don't know if it was jaw-dropping, like, my gosh,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.320]   like, it's great or-- oh, my gosh.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.600]   Well, that's the sense people are getting,
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.880]   is that some people are just made.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.960]   It's jaw-droppingly dis-maying.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.480]   And it's just hard.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   It's going to-- we'll know a lot more tonight.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.120]   It sounds like what Apple's trying to do
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.800]   is start to control that conversation.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.120]   So rather than having people constantly talking about it,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.640]   now that the cat's been out of the bag,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.120]   and people start talking about what it could be and what
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.440]   it couldn't be, they're going to try to end that,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.200]   have a real conversation about this is what it actually is.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.080]   And I think Apple's going to tonight--
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.880]   they're going to try to frame why they're doing what they're
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.380]   doing.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.280]   I do think it's going to be a pretty large overhaul
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.600]   of the editing platform.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   I think that for a while-- and I think that Apple, in some ways,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.960]   has to do this.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.160]   For a while, I got to a point where
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.520]   whether using an avid premiere or a final cut,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.840]   you kind of got into the same environment.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.400]   They're pretty much all the same editing applications
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   with a couple of little things.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.360]   I mean, I would say that premiere integrates better
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.000]   with After Effects.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.760]   Avid deals with large numbers of objects much better
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   than all the other ones.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   And then final cut was the inexpensive, the easiest
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   to use on a Mac platform, very Mac-like based on quick time.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.520]   So those are the advantages.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.800]   But otherwise, the interfaces were very, very similar.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.840]   And I think that they're now getting--
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.880]   They're all timeline based.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.320]   In fact, if you use the old iMovie,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.880]   you probably kind of knew what you were looking at.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.520]   It was a little more complex.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.920]   But the ripple edits and the way that you put it all together,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.040]   all the little bits that you do, it's maybe
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.000]   a couple different keys.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.360]   But outside of that, it's the same.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.560]   So now I think that they're all starting to differentiate.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.000]   Oh, really?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.880]   Already that's happened.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.600]   I mean, I think Adobe's adding more of the effects
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.440]   and more of the stuff.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.400]   They're tying it tighter into the rest of their--
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   After Effects, particularly.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.680]   They've really tried to do that dynamic integration between the two.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   And that became their key.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.800]   Final Cut didn't do as good a job of doing that real time update
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.280]   with the other apps.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.800]   But they were always about the whole suite.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.560]   And so I actually used a lot of--
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.080]   I used the compression tools in the suite.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.240]   I used the audio mix down stuff.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   And so I'm hoping that it's not just a Final Cut Pro update.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.080]   It's really, truly a studio update.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.720]   And we see real significant features across the line.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.240]   When I think about this--
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   But I do think it's an opportunity, if you're rewriting it,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.320]   to rethink what you're doing.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.040]   For instance, none of us--
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.800]   I mean, we in our office use Colorista
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.520]   to do most of our color correction.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.320]   We don't use color.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.680]   So color ships for free with the Final Cut studio.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.040]   But we won't use it because it's cumbersome.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.880]   And I have to export everything out there,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.320]   and then do all the work and bring it back in.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.440]   I'd much rather just use Colorista as a plugin in Final Cut.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.120]   So the question is, are you going to continue
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.320]   to do that send us out somewhere else?
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.400]   Or are we going to pull some of those features in?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.240]   Maybe still have color, but maybe we don't need all those pieces.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.320]   I mean, those are the kind of things
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.880]   that Apple has to figure out.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.360]   And I think that we're going to find out what they think.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.880]   That's just like my--
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.720]   Why would if Apple decides to move away from the Pro
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.960]   and move more towards the end user?
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.680]   Which is what some people think might happen.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.560]   Why would they even do that?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.040]   It's a much bigger market.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.120]   I mean, the world of high-end production
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.920]   is a tiny top of the period.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.520]   The revolution--
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.160]   And that's why they charge $1,200 for Final Cut studio.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.160]   Because they can.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.680]   But how much are they going to charge, I think?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.160]   Well, and I think that when you look at--
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.040]   They do have Final Cut Express.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.280]   Yeah, but yes.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.440]   Why do you shake your head like that, Ann?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.880]   Is it a junky--
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.760]   No, no, no.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.440]   Actually, and honest to God, I'd say I probably
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.640]   use Final Cut Express more in the last number of years.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.880]   Because I think you--
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.840]   It's still quite a hurdle to go from iMovie
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.720]   even to Final Cut Express.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.760]   Well, and I think you really liked the iMovie update
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.280]   where they radically changed the interface.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.240]   I didn't.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.120]   I kind of didn't get it.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.920]   And I used it a little bit.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.400]   I think it was first.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.680]   It's the second generation that I really was impressed with.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.440]   Maybe that was it.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.320]   But at some point, Final Cut Express became my iMovie.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.840]   And then I realized that Final Cut Express was really
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.680]   my Final Cut Pro.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.880]   Because for what I was doing, I didn't really need the extra stuff.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.800]   I was carrying baggage that was overhead.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.720]   And I just found that it actually ran lighter.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.960]   I could get more done because the processor was just
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.920]   a little more available.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.440]   So what would Apple be up to?
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.680]   Maybe making a less expensive Final Cut Express.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   But they'd have to have a uniform interface.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.160]   I think Final Cut Express is kind of--
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.240]   Kill Final Cut Express, reduce Final Cut Pro.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.960]   But look what they did with Aperture.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.520]   I think if you look at--
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   And we've talked about this on the show.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.120]   But if you look at what Apple has done in the past,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.760]   in the near past, not the distant past,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.640]   they've taken all their bundles.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.480]   And they've unbundled them.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.400]   Whether it's iWork or iLife.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.040]   And they've dropped the price by about half the--
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.400]   They sold it on the App Store.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.480]   And they sold it on the App Store.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.440]   And I would argue that the App Store--
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   And I don't think we're going to find--
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.240]   Any Final Cut they could sell on the App Store.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.960]   But more importantly than how many Final Cut
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.200]   they'll sell on the App Store, think about how it positions
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.440]   the App Store.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   We're now moving-- they have to eat their own--
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.000]   Their own granola.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.480]   You know, their own dog food.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.720]   They have to-- so they're going to say--
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.760]   They have two opportunities here.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.880]   One is to say all applications can be sold on the App Store.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.960]   The second thing they can say is they can set the pace.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.440]   This is what pro apps should cost.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.040]   And so if they start saying that Final Cut is--
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.880]   With all of the power--
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   $50.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.720]   Final Cut, let's say, comes in at $99 or $129 or something
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.680]   like that.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   That becomes a big, big, big deal.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720]   It changes-- it puts a lot of downward pressure
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.440]   on the market of what's--
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.520]   You know, I think from a purely financial point of view,
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.720]   this makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.960]   And they'll make a lot of money with it.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.840]   It's a big money maker.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.400]   And I think one of the reasons the pros
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.120]   that I talk to are kind of worried
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.880]   is because Apple's completely capable of doing this.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.600]   There are many companies that would say,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.160]   oh, we can't abandon the market.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.720]   We can't move this way.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.280]   We've got a responsibility to previous users.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.080]   But Apple's not like that.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.080]   Apple dances to the beat of its own drummer.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.800]   In that high end market, I think there's a danger.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.760]   But if you look at where the growth market is right now
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.520]   in our industry--
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   In industry.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.840]   High end is struggling to figure out
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.240]   how it keeps on making money, the low end,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.320]   not even the low end, the mid end, the corporate video,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.520]   educational video, YouTube, crowd.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:14.720]   You know--
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.040]   The two man shops.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.720]   The two man shops.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.760]   That is exploding.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.400]   So do you think--
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.160]   You think you see a simpler application?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.080]   OK, you're making it less expensive.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.680]   How do you modify it?
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.120]   We don't know.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.640]   We don't know.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.140]   We don't know.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.080]   This is pure speculation they may make no changes at all.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.600]   Right.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.880]   I would probably lean towards probably not unbundling.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.560]   Like, it would surprise me if they unbundled,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.480]   only because it becomes really hard to support things
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.080]   like compressor as an unbundled product.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.000]   All by itself.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Because it just doesn't have the market share of compression.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.200]   Like, people use it because it's kind of there.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.480]   But if you had to buy it as a separate thing,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.960]   would people actually buy it?
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.560]   What else would you buy?
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.520]   I mean, if compressor was, let's say, $49 on the Mac App Store.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.840]   You'd buy it.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.400]   I think it were $49.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.440]   Would I buy it?
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.480]   What would you buy?
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.080]   What else would you buy?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.400]   There's so many-- I mean, even in the compression store now,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.880]   I've already picked up a couple of the ones that are probably $14.99.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.280]   And for the day-to-day stuff that I do,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   particularly if I'm just creating--
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.080]   Well, tell us what you use.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.240]   I'm curious now.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.480]   Well, now I have to log in to my machine.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.440]   All right, you can log in and look.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:15.800]   I'll look.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.240]   I have to take a peek and see what--
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   We'll do it at the break.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240]   Because I'd like to know.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.960]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.320]   $15 on the App Store.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   And I'll get to the name of it.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.120]   That's interesting.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.680]   They're selling that stuff on the App Store.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.560]   And again, it's only for $264 stuff.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.080]   So if you're going for stuff for final production and delivery,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.920]   those are good tools.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.120]   Where I still use Compressor today is interoperability.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.320]   So if I know that I suddenly need to send stuff for DVD,
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.800]   or for Blu-ray, or I'm doing mezzanine archive files for someone,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.120]   that's where that comes in handy.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.600]   So it's more of interoperability.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.760]   It's less about the production.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.040]   And that's not where they want to be.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.520]   They want to be the H264 creation tool.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.880]   That's why it has all the publish to YouTube, publish to iPhone.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   Well, that's true.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.640]   There is a larger ecosystem that they want to support
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.760]   so that there's content for their devices.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   So that is something they have to keep in mind.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.400]   And that's not the part I use it for.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.880]   I use other devices for that that are much cheaper,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.720]   or even freer at times.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.880]   For years, there have been basically gooies
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.680]   that were just built on FFmpeg for the Mac.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.840]   And those were some of the best in code tools.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.640]   Handbrake.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.160]   They were out there.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.240]   Handbrake is one of the best ones.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   Because of the advanced settings that you have exposed
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.080]   to be able to tweak if you're a video geek.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.880]   And you want to--
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.000]   I still use program 7 some of the time.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   You just want to--
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.440]   I don't want a bunch of features.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.040]   I just want to compress it and have it.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.240]   That works better than most--
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.200]   So are Avid and Premier rubbing their hands with Cleary,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.600]   saying, oh, we're going to have the pro world all to ourselves?
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:40.920]   Or--
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.040]   I think they're probably sweating.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   I think they're jealous.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.240]   Yeah, I think it's mixed back.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.920]   I think that if Apple grows--
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.720]   They'd like to have that market, both Premier and Avid
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   make low-end versions of their programs.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.320]   I feel like both those companies feel like they're
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.720]   chasing Apple when it comes to this, though.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.800]   Because whatever-- if literally Apple came out
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.160]   with a new version of it, everybody would turn around
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.960]   and go, well, why haven't you guys done that?
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.280]   When you're doing your version of this.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.240]   And yet again, they're chasing Apple.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.120]   Because Apple does such a good job of getting
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.360]   that customer--
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.080]   It is a pivot.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.680]   Piece of it.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.920]   It's a pivot.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.240]   Yes.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   I mean, they're really-- they're saying, well, never mind.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.360]   We worked really hard to get the pro market.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.760]   They got Walter Murch in their pocket and worked damn hard
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.720]   and got a lot of people going for it.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   And now they're going to say, maybe not so much.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.240]   Maybe.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   But I don't know if they're going to outright give up
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.280]   on the high-end market.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.320]   I think that they're going to change a bunch of things,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   streamline a bunch of things.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.120]   And I think there's some people going to feel like they
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.160]   don't have what they want.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.440]   This is all speculation, of course.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.880]   We have no idea what they're going to do.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.960]   But I also think that it does--
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   if they go after the middle of the market,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.520]   it is an opportunity for companies like Avid and Adobe
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.560]   to really focus on that high-end market
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.520]   and make sure that they're able to serve that market.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.600]   Because that's going to be very competitive between the two
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.100]   of them.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.080]   Because right now, what's been happening is Avid's just
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.520]   been losing ground every year to Final Cut.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.920]   So I think there's an opportunity there.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.080]   Avid's never really understood the consumer market, I don't think.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.520]   And so I think that--
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.680]   but I think the danger is if you look at iMovie
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.160]   and iMovie started to--
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.800]   the first new version didn't make any sense at all.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.680]   The second version started to add a lot more--
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   it makes a lot more sense.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.960]   And what you're looking at is a gradual rebuild
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.920]   of the video editing tool.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.520]   You think the same thing maybe for Final Cut?
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.000]   So I think maybe we see one--
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.240]   if this looks like a step back.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.760]   And we don't know if it's going to look like a step back.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.800]   But if it looks like that--
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.640]   But if it looks like that--
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.960]   What they did with iMovie, they continued off
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.120]   or the earlier version for those who wanted it for a while.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.960]   So Final Cut Studio continues to sell for a while.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.000]   And I think that there's a high probability
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.680]   that we will continue to be using Final Cut
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.920]   that we have in our office.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.560]   And we're a Final Cut shop.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.160]   I got five or six copies of that.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.320]   For another year?
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.680]   I think I've got 30 copies of that.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.120]   It's a lot of cuts.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.480]   I'm not going to change all of those tomorrow.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.680]   But I will say, if it does do the stuff that we needed to do,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.960]   I'd be really excited about being $100 each.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.440]   Right.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.000]   Because I don't want to buy the whole swimming--
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   When is--
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.600]   When do my guys don't use motion or--
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.640]   Right.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.200]   When is the meeting?
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.640]   The meeting is tonight at seven o'clock.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.360]   So we'll know you're not streaming it.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.000]   We're not allowed to stream it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.760]   I will be probably posting stuff to--
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.240]   Live blog.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.800]   --it'll be a thorough issue.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.880]   Live blog.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.320]   And then we have this week in media tomorrow,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.200]   afternoon on this desk.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.000]   In the afternoon, we'll be talking about--
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Which I think I'm on with you.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.120]   That'll be a big show.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.720]   Big show to talk about what happened to Final Cut,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.200]   if anything at all.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.080]   And maybe it'll look just--
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.600]   I think that 64-bit multi-threaded is a given.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:39.960]   I mean, I think that--
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.000]   They have to do that.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.560]   I think that's going to make a huge difference for a lot of people.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.480]   If it's not there, then it really becomes--
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.840]   What have you guys been doing?
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.200]   What are you up to?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.960]   And what worries people is that they did lay off a lot of people
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.720]   on the Final Cut team.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   So you're kind of like me.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.600]   A couple months or six months ago.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.100]   Wow.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.920]   And so you're kind of in this and moved a lot of people around.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.680]   A lot of people from the Final Cut team are moved to--
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.880]   A lot of the product managers changed.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   They went over to the iTunes music store, I believe.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.960]   And that was even a while ago in the highlight.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.880]   That all happened in the fall.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.760]   What's-- do you have a projected ship date for a new Final Cut?
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   Any idea?
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.320]   Is there a special time that you--
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.120]   I mean, wouldn't they announce it today?
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.840]   I mean, this seems like the good time to do it.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   I think they're going to talk about it.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.480]   I think that they're going to do it some--
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.080]   I think they're going to ship it sometime before the WWDC.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.640]   And you think they'll unbundle?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.760]   I think they're going to unbundle.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.320]   Andy doesn't--
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.760]   Andy doesn't--
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   Andy doesn't.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   Andy doesn't.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.560]   I don't think they'll unbundle, but I think you're right.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.080]   I think it's got to be within four to six weeks of today.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.720]   And it wouldn't even surprise me if it was.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.240]   And it happened to store?
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.880]   I think that would be ridiculous if it wasn't an absolute--
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   OK, what's your price on the abstract?
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.920]   What's the price you're looking for?
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.160]   You said 99?
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.660]   No, no, no.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.520]   You said 99.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.320]   I said, I think all the individual apps will be 99 or less.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.040]   So they'll unbundle everything, but you'll
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.400]   have to buy it piecemeal.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   And what is it right now?
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.080]   What's the price?
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.880]   12.0.0.0.0 for everything, right?
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.240]   Drop it at 999 for the whole thing.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.960]   You sell something on the app store for 1,000 bucks.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.760]   What do you think, Alex?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.720]   Well, you know, I would say that they don't want to give up
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.400]   the 30%.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   Oh, wait.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.760]   They don't have to.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.200]   I mean, one of the challenges people have talked about with the app
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.360]   store is that there's 50 gigs of information that
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.240]   comes with your current final cut.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.320]   You know, like, when you buy those--
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.560]   I have to say, even downloading the 5 or 4 or 5 gigabyte
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.000]   Xcode every time they do an update.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.840]   Because it commits an incredible pain in the--
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.760]   Kister.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.000]   Not happy about it.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.400]   But I have to admit that as someone who's lost their final cut
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.120]   disk--
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.680]   It's nice.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.840]   I am really excited about the idea that I can just hit
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.680]   update because--
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.840]   Well, not only update, but reinstall--
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.800]   And then any machine.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.360]   Because a license model is very interesting for the app store
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.240]   too.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.400]   Yeah, like it.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.760]   So you can't go too low because you
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.680]   don't want somebody like you who has 30 final cut licenses
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.120]   paying $99 and installing it in 30 machines.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.040]   The problem with that, of course,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.800]   is that means everybody would have the log in as me.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.880]   You know, like, right.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.400]   So you create a new account.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.800]   You create a pixel core account that's only for that purpose.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.200]   Are you telling him how to cheat?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.720]   That's not cheating.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.040]   It's legal.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.400]   That's what Apple wants you to do.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.760]   Until they fix that loophole.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.000]   Well, I don't think it's a loophole.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.440]   I think that's their intent.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.880]   Because everybody still has the largest dongle in the world,
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.720]   the Mac.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Right.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.600]   The world's largest dongle.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.160]   I think we have a show title.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.880]   We're going to take a break.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.760]   Andy Beach is with us.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.800]   He's chief evangelist for Sea Well and a compression
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.200]   expert.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.080]   Alex Lindsey, of course, in the pixel core is here.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   We are doing Mac break weekly live from the show floor
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.000]   at the National Association of Broadcasters
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.520]   show in Las Vegas, Nevada, baby.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.760]   And you know, every time I do one of these things,
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.040]   I wish we had go to meeting.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.160]   We could just come here via go to meeting.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   I wouldn't have to be here.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.040]   We could just do it all.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.480]   Go to meeting eliminates all that online travel.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.960]   Makes it easy to have meetings on the phone.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   It couldn't be easier to set up.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.200]   In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.160]   click the try it free button and use Mac break as the alpha
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   code.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.920]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.680]   You will have it installed before I am done talking.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.280]   You don't need to call the IT department.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.960]   You don't need to do it.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.160]   Work forwarding.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.520]   Nothing.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.160]   It's just there.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:04.680]   It's easy.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.360]   And now anytime you hit the road,
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   you've got your iPad, that free go to meeting app,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.880]   your Mac, your PC, any computer you're using,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.320]   you can log on to your go to meeting account,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.400]   have 128-bit SSL encrypted connection.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.880]   It's like a VPN to your-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.800]   That's go to my PC.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.360]   This is go to meeting.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.080]   That's a good thing too, by the way.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.600]   Go to meeting.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.200]   Very similar.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.040]   Actually, the reason I get confused sometimes
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.760]   is the back-end is pretty much the same thing.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.840]   It's remote access.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.680]   But how do you use it?
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.160]   Go to meeting.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.000]   Same thing.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.720]   Go right now to go to meeting.com.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Click the try it free button.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.480]   Put in this alpha code Mac break.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.960]   Again, in fact, you could do all of them.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.800]   All of--
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.040]   I don't know how we can run our business
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.680]   without a go to meeting.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.880]   Go to meeting is amazing.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.760]   We have so many meetings.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.960]   So we have classes and meetings and all kinds of things
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.800]   that are all happening online.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.160]   And we're spread out all over the world.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.600]   I mean, I have people that I work with that I've never
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.720]   actually met in person.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.200]   People often say, well, let's have a conference call.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.080]   We say, well, in fact, I know Lisa now just writes,
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.240]   well, we'll do a GTM.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.560]   And it assumes everybody knows.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.440]   That's a go to meeting.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   Oh, yeah, I got the GTM for you.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.760]   Well, we do.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.040]   In the company, we all know.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   That means you're going to have a conference call number.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.320]   If you want, there's a meeting bridge.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   It's all built in part of the package.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.440]   VoIP as well.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.240]   If you're on a computer that has a sound card and a microphone,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.800]   you can use that for the conference.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.320]   Of course, you get the presenter's screen,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.840]   but you could share your screen.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.960]   You'll start your meeting in seconds.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.200]   Everyone can join it in seconds.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.680]   You don't have to jump through hoops to meet.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.160]   And that's important if you're trying to pitch clients.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.880]   Couldn't be easier.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   In fact, your clients will be impressed.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.920]   They'll say, oh, this is nice.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.000]   I'd like to use this if they don't already know about it.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.360]   And you just tell them, oh, no problem.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.200]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.520]   Click the try it free button.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.120]   Use a promo code Macbreak due to all your clients and friends.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   Use a promo code Macbreak.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.440]   That's how Alex makes Alex very happy.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.920]   It does.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.400]   You do that.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   It makes me feel so special.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.680]   Go to meeting.com from a code Macbreak.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.280]   We love it.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.360]   We should try it.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.440]   So big announcement out of Cisco,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.400]   they're closing the FLIP operation.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.880]   No more FLIP camps firing.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.320]   550 people.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.400]   They just acquired this less than a year ago.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.640]   When they did, we were all like, what are they going to do with it?
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.440]   What are they thinking?
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.000]   And it turns out they weren't thinking.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.360]   They weren't thinking.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:13.920]   What's happened?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.320]   Is it because nobody's buying a FLIP camp?
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.120]   Is it because everybody has an iPhone?
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.840]   This is better than a FLIP camp?
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.760]   I think there's two things there.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.120]   I mean, everybody has, at this point, pretty good cameras
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.560]   in their phone.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.640]   Like my iPhone and camera.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.080]   That's as good as a FLIP camp.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.240]   It definitely is good as a FLIP camp.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.000]   But until you get into--
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.920]   I used to carry-- when I travel for work,
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.080]   I used to carry a little digital camera,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.000]   like one of those little ones, like a quick one,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.560]   to take photos of everything so I can remember it.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.880]   Just note taking.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.840]   And that went away when I got the iPhone 3GS,
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.120]   because finally that camera was good enough
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   that I didn't need two devices.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.720]   Exactly.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.480]   And so now for that lower end market,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.240]   all that stuff went away because now the video is even
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.880]   good enough for all those things that I want.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.160]   So it was already eroding because of that.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.680]   But then why is Cisco in that business?
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.520]   Like that is such a weird--
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.640]   Well, that was a strange thing.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.480]   It was such a consumer device, and they're not ultimately
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.920]   a consumer company when it comes to that.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.720]   Well, they basically admitted.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.920]   They made a mistake, I guess.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.280]   I mean--
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.760]   Well, they tried.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.640]   There was a lot of-- it wasn't for not trying.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.160]   They didn't push it.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.760]   Oh, they were advertising.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.400]   I mean, it was all over San Francisco.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.600]   I was like, you know, for the FLIP.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.960]   And I think that--
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.880]   I love those ads.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.000]   Remember those great ads that they ran where they actually
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.200]   used people's actual videos?
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.080]   And they showed them, and they said, made with a FLIP.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.800]   I thought that was an excellent campaign.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.280]   If that couldn't sell them, it's not for lack-- you write.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.880]   It's not for lack of marketing or ability to market.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.720]   So lack of interest.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.200]   Well, it was a price that it's--
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.000]   I thought that given that it was Cisco,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.520]   we were going to see them take, oh, this
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.920]   is a great little easy to use camera.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   And we're going to add networking capabilities.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.440]   We're going to add some way that you can stream from this.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.360]   And that's what I thought we were going to see come in.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.440]   And as someone who--
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.560]   I do things with Cisco, I meet with them.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.440]   And it's one of those things where it's like, OK,
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.160]   they're going to take this consumer technology,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.880]   and they're going to put it into the infrastructure.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.360]   And they're going to find some really cool way
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.960]   to use this thing in an infrastructure
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.760]   like we've never thought before.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.200]   And they didn't know.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.600]   And maybe they thought--
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.100]   No.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.260]   And we never know why.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.980]   I mean, it could have been that some of the technical things
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.100]   that they thought they could do once they started digging into it.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.360]   They just couldn't make the difference.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.060]   Maybe that's it.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.500]   You think that they wanted to make it better,
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.900]   but they couldn't?
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.340]   You know, sometimes things work really well,
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.300]   but then you open it up.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.100]   And there's a lot of spaghetti pieces in there.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.340]   You're not exactly sure how to do it.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.300]   I think it's just killed.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.300]   It's killed by smartphones with great cameras.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.420]   It's killed by still cameras with a great video.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.180]   I mean, if you have a decent-- if you have a still camera,
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.100]   almost a still camera, you've got better-- again,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.460]   better recording than a flip camera.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.300]   So I'm going to give you.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   Why would you buy a flip cam?
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.060]   I bought a flip cam for my kit two years ago.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.580]   This should have been the writing on the wall.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.060]   He never used it.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.780]   I have two of them.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.940]   I don't use it.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.980]   It seems like a good idea.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.220]   It seems like you're something you're going to use a lot.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.900]   And then you don't.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.300]   Look at coffees magically appearing.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.580]   It's like cousin Edible.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.540]   The hand just comes in.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.220]   Isn't that great?
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:24:59.700]   That was amazing.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.140]   You should get one of those in your office.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.940]   I was just thinking.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.740]   The magic coffee right now.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.620]   The magic coffee hand has appeared.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.580]   Thank you, Linfu.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.340]   The great Linfu.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.740]   I have-- I just-- I don't know.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.540]   I just feel like we have such a great team here.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.420]   And the broadcast is looking so good.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.740]   When we were invited to be here at the National Association
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.620]   of Broadcasters, I said, well, wait a minute.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.740]   First of all, broadcasters, Twit.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.980]   I mean, we're the anti-broadcaster, right?
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.740]   We're streaming on the internet.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.500]   We're everything they're not.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.460]   So I was a little surprised they were even interested.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.620]   I guess it shows that they have some forethought
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.460]   about what's happening in the industry.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.540]   But then I thought, well, we're going to look crappy.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.180]   And then we'll be embarrassed.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.780]   And it looks great.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.940]   So we had Roger Ambrose, who's our creative guy,
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.780]   is doing the new set.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.460]   He did a beautiful booth for us.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.940]   We've got the Tri-caster HD-H50, which
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.900]   has given us really great high-def video.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.820]   We're just using the standard JVC HD camcores.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.460]   These are, I don't know, about $2,000 to get--
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.540]   but we have HD video because of the new Tri-caster.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.060]   I was here at CES, and I was pretty impressed
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.460]   by what you were able to do then.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.460]   I thought that was great.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.620]   And I was blown away when I saw this getting set up.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.380]   I just felt the pressure, because we're at the NAB show.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.660]   I felt the pressure to do this.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.820]   And yeah, it's funny, because people come up to me.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.780]   We have monitors down here on the steps.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.660]   We've got people watching.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.420]   And the monitor says, we don't have a speaker,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.980]   because we don't want to get feedback.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.980]   We said, listen on your smartphone.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.420]   It blived up to a tattoo.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.540]   And people have been coming up to me saying,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.540]   is that what it looks like in the studio?
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.180]   And there's our booth.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.900]   There's our booth.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.700]   It's just-- yeah.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.660]   Whoa.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.980]   Whoa.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.500]   Yeah, just I'm really pleased with what they've been able to do.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.740]   So thank you, Lynn and Eileen, and, gosh,
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.780]   the whole crew of people that put such work into this.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.500]   I don't know how I got off on that tangent, but there you go.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.060]   You got coffee.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.660]   You had NAB.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.260]   I got coffee.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:57.740]   That's right.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.780]   He was so happy to get coffee.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.700]   I'm so happy to get coffee.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.540]   Off we went.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.780]   I should do a Starbucks commercial for free,
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.820]   just because I'm so happy to get coffee.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.620]   Love you, Starbucks.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.580]   Hey, love you.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:06.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.020]   We didn't get you anything, Andy.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.700]   Are you OK?
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.220]   You know what?
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.060]   I'm so over-caffeinated.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.940]   I know that was possible.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.700]   As many people watching me show have noticed.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.140]   We know.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.180]   Let's move on to-- there aren't, as usual,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.380]   the big story is waiting for Apple to say something
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.140]   is the big story.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   Isn't that always the way?
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.500]   There is an interesting story coming out of Amazon this morning.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.460]   They've announced one more Kindle, one that's so low priced.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.220]   It's almost free.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.940]   It's almost free.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.940]   I think that's where they're headed.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.140]   It's an ad supported Kindle.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.020]   Actually, it's only $25 less than the Wi-Fi.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.940]   So instead of $139, it's $115.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.140]   Are they just kind of just slowly trying to creep that direction?
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.220]   I think that's what they want to do.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.220]   How much money do we get in this layer before we go down
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:45.820]   to the next thing, right?
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.620]   And do you blame them?
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.020]   Because ultimately, don't they make their money from the books,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.820]   not the Kindle?
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.420]   So they'd love to get a Kindle at cost into your hands.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.820]   I don't know what the cost of the Kindle is.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.220]   I think we now know it's somewhere around $115.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.700]   They say the ads will never appear in the book, which I think
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.300]   would be a big negative.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   You're reading Warren Peace and all of a sudden it says,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.780]   you have a rect office function.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.980]   Now, is that the 3G and the Wi-Fi capable--
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.460]   Just Wi-Fi.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.780]   Just Wi-Fi.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.220]   OK.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.340]   And it will be on the front--
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.500]   on the home page, the front screen.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.940]   Presumably, the boot screen will have some ads.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.060]   And I think, look, it's a $25 discount.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.420]   Obviously, they don't expect to make a lot of money on ads
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.500]   on the thing.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.180]   But they're subsidizing it a little bit anyway,
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.980]   as much as they can, so that you can get a cheaper Kindle
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.100]   and buy more books from Amazon.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.780]   We had Jerry Parnell, who's a science fiction author on
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.380]   Twitter on Sunday.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.460]   And an interesting guy, because he and Corey Doctorow
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.060]   are getting fights over openness, about giving away books,
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.620]   and so forth.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.500]   He said, I want to make money for my books.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.340]   He has gotten the ebook, "Religion."
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.380]   And thanks to Amazon, he says he can now--
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.100]   maybe you'll sell 10,000 units, but you keep all the money.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.940]   You don't have to--
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.180]   Amazon takes us 30%, but you get so much more than you get
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.180]   from a publisher.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.940]   And he says it's very easy to publish,
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.100]   so he can take existing material and republish it.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.300]   Old columns, we actually got Devorak
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.420]   to say he was going to take his old columns this week
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.940]   and make them available as ebooks on Amazon.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.100]   But it's different.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.180]   It's not ebooks in general.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.180]   Jerry said, we tried ebooks just in general.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.340]   This is Amazon ebooks.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.460]   Well, I'm still buying stuff on Kindle.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.740]   And I have an iPad.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.620]   I don't have a Kindle.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.100]   Well, me too.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.420]   Right, because a lot of times, they'd be able to build it.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.740]   But even if there are other ways to get it,
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.460]   it's just so easy to get it that way.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.940]   It is.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.260]   And I think Amazon said that they're now selling more ebooks
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.580]   than they are physical books.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.060]   And they made that move last year.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.700]   So when we talked about this a little bit,
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.960]   this was the thesis from Paul Theron on Windows Weekly
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.360]   that Amazon is making the move.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.260]   That they're now the big dog, even maybe bigger than Apple,
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.220]   for books, not just for books, for cloud storage.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.300]   Don't forget, for music sales.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.680]   Last week, we just finished moving a huge chunk
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.780]   of our online stuff to Amazon.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.340]   Cloud drive?
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.240]   I think, yeah, I think that there is something going on here.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.560]   And I think it's interesting to watch
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.240]   Amazon and Google, arguably Apple,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.800]   as the big three moving the technology industry
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.200]   in a very dramatic direction.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.920]   We're here at the National Association of Broadcasters Show,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.560]   Thunderbolts.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.160]   You told me, Alex, wait till NAB.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.440]   Wait till the NAB show.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.400]   And Thunderbolts will come into its own.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.320]   Well--
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.920]   Here it is.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.480]   Really?
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.600]   What have you seen?
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   So we're starting to see Thunderbolts everywhere,
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.620]   or people talking about the fact that they
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.420]   have Thunderbolt enabled applications or technology
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.380]   previews over at A.J.A. they have, obviously,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:03.020]   the little I/O Express, which is your SDI and video interface.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.420]   They have a technology preview of it, of course,
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.300]   working on Thunderbolts instead of an Express card.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.700]   Now what that means is in the field,
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.380]   I no longer have to have a 17-inch MacBook Pro just
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.220]   to connect a big video camera.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.840]   I can use a 13-inch.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   It changes that process.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.640]   You could use--
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.840]   What has Thunderbolts now?
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.080]   Just the new MacBooks?
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.760]   The new MacBooks.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.600]   But presumably a mini will come--
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.000]   So I'm going to guess that by once--
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.560]   Maybe it would be a good choice.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.880]   By WWDC, I think we're going to see all of them.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.720]   I think you'll have iMacs, Mac Pros.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   I just think if they have--
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.040]   Every half rev, it'll be the thing that gets added.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.680]   I think that is the upgrade for the hardware
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.720]   coming over the next six to eight weeks.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:49.420]   So anyway, so Blackmagic already has theirs running.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.060]   So they have a--
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.700]   What's interesting to me is it's not to a hard drive.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.720]   Because that's what we initially said, oh, well,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.500]   this will be a way to connect fast hard drives.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.260]   This is connecting other stuff.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.420]   It's connecting anything that needed a lot of bandwidth.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.740]   Do you really need gigabits?
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.240]   Right.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.500]   Well, up to 10 gigabits.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.300]   Wow.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.340]   So a lot of these are 3-gigabit devices.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.100]   But what they were using before was USB 3.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.820]   A lot of them were using USB 3.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.200]   And they needed to have something that
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.900]   was going to be faster than Firewire 800.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.960]   I think that's--
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.340]   How many things can you connect together?
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.120]   Because you can daisy-chain Thunderbolt.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.620]   Seven total.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.620]   Seven.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.120]   OK.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.220]   And most of these devices--
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.100]   It's kind of like Firewire in that regard.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.460]   Yeah, there's a certain limit to that.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.180]   And I don't know whether that-- there was some talk about
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.060]   whether they're not really using the optical cabling right
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   now.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.280]   They're using copper cabling, which might be limiting the number
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.440]   of things that you can connect to it.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.460]   Yeah, they couldn't get-- apparently
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.700]   couldn't get the optical working.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.860]   That was the original plan.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.580]   And that was what the high speed was going to be.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.020]   But the--
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.060]   I think they're getting the high speed.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.940]   But I think that what they're not getting is you can't
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.140]   bounce it as many times.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.340]   We are seeing some crazy fast drives.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.580]   I think GTEC is showing a technology sonnet.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.740]   So the hard drives that we talked about--
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.660]   So we are seeing those.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.980]   Those are definitely coming out.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.540]   Well, I think it's interesting that it's more than just hard
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.060]   drives.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.900]   That is-- you've missed other things--
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.300]   cameras and switchers.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.100]   I think that there's a--
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.580]   It's really an external PCI express bus, basically,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.860]   is what it is.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.740]   And the fact that it can be out there on a cable,
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.380]   how long can that cable go?
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.860]   I don't know what the distance is.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.900]   I don't know what-- I don't think it's that long,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.620]   but I don't think it's--
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.140]   Well, if it's seven feet--
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.140]   Seven connections.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.940]   Seven connections.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.500]   And say like Firewire, say a three meter--
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.460]   Or that's plenty of distance to get--
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.660]   That's the long run.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.260]   Well, you have to remember that when you're thinking
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.620]   about that distance, it's all cumulative.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.740]   So if you're connecting seven devices and each one has a--
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.620]   No, you're pulling--
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.260]   You have to start thinking about the length of the cable
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.180]   between each one.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.100]   Because that starts--
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.140]   Certainly, Lacey has a five-daisy chain here at their booth.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.540]   Five hard drives, daisy chains.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.180]   Well, and I think that you get to a point
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.740]   where you get a laptop--
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.340]   I think the big thing that this opens up for Apple
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.380]   is you get a laptop that just has that one connector.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.020]   Like that connector connects to your hard drive--
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.980]   Imagine being able to sit down, pop that one little cable in,
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.740]   and now you're connected to your monitor, your network,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.620]   your hard drives.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.340]   Everything is all just that one little connector.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.220]   So there's no array on the side of your computer anymore.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.140]   There's just like--
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.380]   Docking just got easier.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.020]   Wow.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.940]   And there's rumors that they're going to--
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.500]   There's rumors that they figured out some way
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   to put it into the power adapter.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.540]   Like the next version--
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.180]   Well, so right now it's in the mini display port.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.680]   Right.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.180]   There's rumors.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.860]   Now you're saying put it in the MagSafe adapter.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.820]   There's rumors that there is that they've
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.140]   been applied for patents.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.220]   So you have a splitter that goes to the power, the ACs.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.420]   Yeah, you just plug it in, and then you have a little box.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.340]   Why would you do that, though?
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.180]   What's the advantage of it?
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.700]   Apple.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.140]   They don't like connectors.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.340]   So the whole thing is is that--
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.380]   So your monitor and your plower--
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.700]   I don't know if I like that.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.540]   And I don't really want to have 120 volts AC on my same cable
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.060]   that I'm--
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:43.540]   60 Hertz line.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.300]   Well, no, but that's not-- but that's getting--
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.620]   your power is 12 volts by the time it gets to your computer.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.220]   So I mean, it's DC--
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.700]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.220]   So it's DC--
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:51.900]   It's DC.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.420]   OK.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.900]   But the--
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:59.380]   Still, the other end of that wire is connected to 120 volts AC.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.660]   But imagine that's just connecting your monitor.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.940]   Your monitor is connected to everything else,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.540]   and you're getting--
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.100]   So the idea is you only have--
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.420]   maybe even USB ports.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.300]   You have one connector that's everything.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.180]   And everything at home is all just plugged into your--
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.500]   Right.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.300]   Whatever that device-- you have a brick, basically,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.380]   that's the other side of it.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:14.900]   It's the fire wire.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.500]   It could be a brick or it could just be your monitor.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.420]   Our monitor's going to have a fire wire, USB, another--
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.860]   Other connectors.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.140]   Thunderbolt connector.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.340]   All those things could be along one of those,
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.820]   and you just simply pop it into your computer
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.860]   and you're connected to everything.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.580]   And you don't have to--
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.580]   I've got to plug all this stuff.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.660]   Right.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.100]   All right.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.700]   I'm buying it.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.500]   Because you document it.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.940]   But except for the AC thing, I want to have two.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.900]   I want one AC.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.900]   I think that's a long way away.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.020]   I think they do that.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.940]   That would be a long way away.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.860]   Really?
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.340]   Yeah, but I think that they could--
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.620]   Because I'll tell you where they do--
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.620]   Because I'll tell you where they do--
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.660]   They made it all like connectors.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.100]   But I don't like dongles.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.540]   I don't want to carry a big-ass dongle in my briefcase
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.420]   so I can have a USB port.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:50.900]   Right.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.580]   Right.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.780]   That's a disadvantage.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.220]   Totally.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:53.420]   OK.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:53.780]   Come on.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.300]   It's pretty sweet.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.580]   Just having that air with just a couple of ports there.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.900]   We got everything we need right there.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.740]   It's good.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.620]   What more do we need?
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.820]   So how big is the hard drives we're seeing here?
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820]   G4's.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.580]   How big are we?
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.620]   The largest one I think I saw was the Sonnet.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.780]   Sonnet had a--
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.300]   It's a RAID.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   RAID slide.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.420]   It's like seven drives or eight drive RAID that
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.460]   was any way you wanted and plugged in via that.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.460]   Right.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.900]   So I think that was the biggest one.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.260]   The biggest one I've seen with Thunderbolt so far.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.860]   Are any PC manufacturers doing Thunderbolt?
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.020]   Or is it just an Apple thing?
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:29.860]   Is it chat room?
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.180]   Is anybody in the PC space doing that?
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:32.980]   They're all-- they're all--
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.900]   They're all talking about USB 3.0.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.060]   They're still living in the past.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.340]   Let me tell you.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.220]   Well, that's been a long, long time pushback and forth.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.380]   This is the USB versus Firewire, USB versus--
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.220]   You really wanted USB 3, right?
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:48.660]   I mean, that was--
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.580]   I really wanted to fast connection.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.940]   I think forget it now, because it's not here to appear.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.460]   Someone asked me.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.300]   They're like, you were talking about USB 3.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.500]   I'm like, I'm done with USB 3.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.000]   Right.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.060]   You just wanted the speed.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.780]   I just wanted-- I just wanted to be
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.940]   able to connect large cameras to a 13-inch laptop.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.500]   Right.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.420]   I mean, that's what I want.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:03.780]   Catch it.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.220]   And USB 3 was the conduit to do that.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.020]   And now I have a better conduit.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   I'm past it.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.100]   All the PC guys are saying, USB 3 is living in the past.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:12.900]   What are you talking about?
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.460]   We don't even have it yet.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.420]   We have it, but not every problem.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.940]   It isn't that big problem.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.900]   Yes.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.740]   The past comes quicker than ever.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.740]   My friends.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.240]   Yes.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:22.500]   Right.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   Tomorrow's the past in some places.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.860]   Well, but I think that's one of the challenges.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.820]   I mean, that's all the constant advantage that Apple has,
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.620]   is they can make that decision and just do it.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.740]   The problem is, is that Intel on the PC side
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.500]   can sit there and talk about Thunderbolt.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.820]   And then they have to slowly persuade all these PC
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.660]   manufacturers to slowly add those functionalities.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.380]   And Apple just do it.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.900]   Yeah, we'll do it.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.180]   And then within six months, it's on every computer
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:43.740]   that Apple makes.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.660]   All right.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.300]   Well, remember the firewire lesson, though.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.540]   I mean, they got adoption, and then they kind of--
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.220]   Yeah, but I kind of came back to it.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.540]   I guess I would argue-- well, number one
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.420]   is I think that the reason that Apple lost adoption was--
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.140]   Apple actually-- I don't know.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.660]   I'm probably going to get myself in trouble,
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.180]   but it's 10 years old.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.900]   So he doesn't know anything.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.020]   He's just speculating.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.620]   Of course.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.660]   So Apple-- go ahead.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.860]   Speculate away.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.620]   Don't say anything is going to get you in trouble.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.820]   No, no, I won't say it.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:23.740]   The Apple-- so when they started Firewire--
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.860]   I see it's very analogous because Firewire was created
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.540]   by Intel with Apple, as has Thunderbolt.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.620]   And what Apple did-- there was no--
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.540]   Or really light peak.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.300]   When they began, there was an option
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.900]   to charge licensing fees.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.420]   But they didn't.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:37.980]   They didn't.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.300]   And everybody incorporated it into everything.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.140]   But they did retain the right to the name,
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.180]   which, when all the PC manufacturers had to call it,
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.740]   IEEE 1394.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.340]   But then Apple started charging licensing fees.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.260]   Or PCs.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.140]   Not for the cameras.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.460]   Oh, not good.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.020]   That's what killed it.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:54.820]   $2.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.420]   That's what killed it.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.460]   And what changed is, is that you then had--
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.740]   it changed the end price.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.260]   Right.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.060]   The end price was by $50.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.980]   And in a world that--
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.620]   everything is--
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.340]   You do that.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.300]   --raiser sharp.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.740]   What they did is that's why all these PC manufacturers
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.940]   stopped using Firewire.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.820]   As they started using it, and they stopped installing it
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.860]   automatically, you had to buy an extra card for that.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.060]   But the thing is, is that-- here's
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.340]   what's important for Apple, though, from home video and video,
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.500]   is that all these cameras had Firewire built into them.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.140]   And that stayed for a long time.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:24.660]   Recently.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.900]   So if you want to connect to your--
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.260]   You had to have an Apple.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.580]   You had to have a Mac.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.780]   So in the end of the '90s, early 2000s,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.340]   when everyone was starting to get these Firewire cameras,
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.460]   the only thing that you could easily plug it into was a Mac.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.660]   And that's where it became like, if you want to do video,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.420]   you got to use a Mac, because otherwise--
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.920]   Right.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.220]   --these are your drivers.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.140]   It probably turned out to be a very good move for Apple.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.260]   Some people argue that they did that on purpose.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.300]   They didn't want the money.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.260]   They wanted to kill us.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.860]   They wanted to kill us was to get a two or three-year advantage.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.020]   Kill it on them, you see exactly what they got.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.260]   And they did.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.860]   And we're living in such a different world.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.580]   That's 10 years ago.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.360]   And now we're living in a world where they want to redo
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.620]   Final Cut Pro so that it's more for consumers.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.300]   They've abandoned Firewire completely.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.820]   And trying to.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.300]   Camcordis.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.220]   A lot of us throw throw-up cameras.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.780]   There's also abandoned Firewire.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.780]   There's one camera left, HB 40.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.460]   And that's out of them off the market, right?
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.140]   It's still there.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:14.740]   They're still selling it.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.140]   They keep on saying they're going to get rid of it.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.540]   But I think we can't--
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.500]   We keep buying them.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.420]   Because it's the only one?
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.380]   It's the only one that you can connect to a Firewire
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.020]   connection.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.140]   But the problem is that you're still stuck with tape.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.860]   You know, you have to--
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   There's no solid state recorder.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   Scooter X says Firewire is not abandoned.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:30.980]   It's not.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.500]   It's not.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:31.820]   It's not.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.540]   Well, OK.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.420]   Yes, it is.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.500]   It hasn't been kicked off the back of the caboose,
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.740]   but it's sitting right on the ledge.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.980]   And I'm sad.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.740]   Because it died before we had a real replacement.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.540]   Yeah, the 800 connector was never for prime time, in my opinion.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.940]   The 800 speed is what we wanted.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.940]   But that connector burns Firewire cables
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.500]   lying around with the 800 connector.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.780]   I know, but the 800 connector burns out.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.260]   We've got lots of failures with it.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.580]   We've had lots of--
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.820]   My nearest they connected.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.420]   The 800 is the one that will always pull out of a device.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.500]   I can always get a 6-pence.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.060]   It falls out.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   Like the slightest lead--
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.420]   You look at it.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.500]   And it just--
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.620]   I give up.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.740]   I didn't really want to be connected.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.540]   Which is very painful when you're transferring the phone.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.260]   It's extremely painful, right at the end.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.340]   So is Thunderbolt the--
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.420]   be all in end all or is--
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.500]   I mean, there are other--
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.940]   there's fiber channel and--
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.100]   Yeah, but they're really expensive.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.420]   Right, that's crazy expensive.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.580]   I mean, that's all.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.900]   Yeah, so I mean, I think that--
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.260]   I think that Thunderbolt for the mid--
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:31.700]   Right.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.660]   Low to--
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.380]   I mean, I didn't see a lot of Thunderbolt stuff out there.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.260]   It's early, early days.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:37.780]   It's really--
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.700]   It's just three weeks.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.900]   Isn't it three weeks since they announced it?
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.740]   It may be very nice on it.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.820]   Right, so a little more than that.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.220]   But it's such early days.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.020]   I think it's one that--
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.540]   it's definitely going to get some traction, though.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.820]   I mean, that's a--
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.940]   it's pretty cool.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.060]   Every storage company that I talk to out there--
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.620]   I mean, everyone making medium-sized,
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.580]   they're talking about it.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.180]   They don't have to.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.500]   It will definitely start with storage,
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.780]   which is kind of what Firewire did.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.460]   But I think--
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.700]   Apple doesn't make it up.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.620]   But computer with an external SATA and the E- SATA.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.700]   You can get-- you can add an E- SATA to your Mac Pro.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.020]   They're going to tell you that--
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.940]   They're going to tell you that the answer is Thunderbolt.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.460]   Thunderbolt.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.620]   You know what's funny is there's actually--
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.900]   What would be sad is a continued bifurcation
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.060]   between the PC and the Mac world,
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.060]   because PCs are E- SATA and USB 3.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.780]   And Apple, I could see now the writings on the wall.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.980]   You'll never see either on a Mac-attached.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.180]   No, absolutely not.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.020]   You'll see Thunderbolt.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.020]   Well, what's interesting is that there's
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.340]   an E- SATA port on a Mac Pro.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.620]   I know.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.140]   I've used it.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.700]   You get a little--
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.220]   It's like hidden.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.020]   It's like hidden behind the fans or whatever.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.620]   You dig way in there and you pop--
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.060]   I've used it.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.500]   That's what I'm really--
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.340]   We've known.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.380]   I know.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.980]   It's worse to know that they put it on the board.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.060]   But just didn't give you access.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.180]   And then just didn't--
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.620]   Put it somewhere else.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.860]   Somebody sells--
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.360]   Let's see.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.860]   Somebody sells a little--
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.580]   There's a couple of times.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.500]   --pender, basically.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.000]   Right.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.020]   It just doesn't do anything.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.540]   It just extends it so you can reach it.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.500]   Right.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.540]   There are-- and somebody in the chair, I'm saying this,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.180]   you could theoretically do Thunderbolt USB 3,
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   Thunderbolt E- SATA, all of that's capable.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.140]   There's nothing that prevents you from doing that.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.860]   You could have a Thunderbolt on one side and yeah.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.180]   And just an E- SATA-- you could make it a little cable.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:08.680]   Right.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.180]   Right.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.180]   Right.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.660]   So Thunderbolt could be a universal solution.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.540]   Do we know if Apple is charging a license fee for it?
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.040]   We don't know.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.940]   I don't think they are.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.580]   Not yet.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.580]   Not yet.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.740]   You're a busy manufacturer.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.460]   You're saying, yeah.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.460]   Sure.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.620]   First one's always finished.
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.380]   Sure.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:24.660]   Sure.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.820]   I'll buy that.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.020]   All right.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.180]   We're talking about Max.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.420]   Believe it or not, we are.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.420]   We haven't said a word about the iPhone.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:31.940]   It's true.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.340]   It's a shock.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.060]   We're talking about Max and more on the Mac Break Weekly.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.540]   Live from the NAB show in Las Vegas, Nevada,
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.220]   Alex has been trying to get me to go to NAB for years.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.220]   You finally got me out here.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:43.580]   Aren't you having fun?
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.740]   I'm having a blast.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.260]   It's a fun show.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.900]   You know what's nice?
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.460]   It's a toy.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.460]   It's toys.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.060]   Have you been to the central home?
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.060]   That's all the real toys.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.700]   And as I wander down, it's like, in fact,
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.620]   I was going walking around with Liz, she said,
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.100]   you need an Amazon wish list for broadcast supply gear.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.340]   She said, people would buy you stuff.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.860]   She said, I would like a Jimmy Jib.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.340]   You see the Donnie Jib?
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.180]   I did.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.740]   Right outside it between here.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.100]   I would like one of those.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.580]   I think we should get one.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.340]   Well, how much are they?
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.020]   $15,000 grand?
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.700]   No, no, no.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.780]   They have one with a remote head for $6,800.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.140]   OK.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:15.740]   We'll split it.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.740]   Now let's put it.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.260]   OK, it's done.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.060]   It's all.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.660]   Can you put in the X1 on there?
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.580]   And then you use the joystick.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.340]   It's got the joystick.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.220]   It's got the weights.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.220]   It's got the whole thing.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.260]   You know, poor Brent.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.180]   Brent was walking around.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.100]   You know the shot that we show you every once in a while
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:29.860]   of the booth.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.340]   I finally figured out how Brent's doing that.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.580]   He's putting an EX1 on a really long pole.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.700]   There it is.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.700]   He's got it on a pole.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.740]   He walks around with a pole.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.340]   Now if he does--
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.180]   He's very good.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:40.700]   He's very good.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.700]   Just think of what he could do.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.940]   If he had a Jib, we could have swooping shots going all
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.460]   around.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.180]   And Brent and Brent and I looked at that together.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.940]   And then I also would like the Segway Steadicam.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.380]   It's a Steadicam on a Segway.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.700]   I know I want it.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.220]   This afternoon I'm putting on one of the--
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.340]   Steadicam has a Jib on a Steadicam.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.140]   I'm putting it on.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:01.780]   You lie.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.940]   No, no, I'm going to put it on.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.620]   I'm going to put it on.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.860]   OK, so I should explain what a Jib is.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.940]   First of all, a Steadicam is a rig that you strap on,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.780]   and then you hold the camera and it holds a steady.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.060]   A Jib on a Steadicam would be a crane attached to your chest.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.180]   Be like a big pole coming out of your forehead.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.940]   No, you're lying.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.020]   There's no such thing.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.340]   Betcha, betcha, betcha.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.180]   This is a big old April Fool's joke.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.660]   This is something like think equally.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.660]   All right, all right, I believe you.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.420]   You don't have to show me.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.700]   He's pulling it up on his iPhone.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.940]   Hey, I mentioned the iPhone.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.900]   This show brought to you by our good friends at FreshBooks.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.820]   If you are in business for yourself,
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.420]   if you're a consultant, if you need to send out invoices,
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.900]   you know I don't have to tell you what a pain in that case
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.500]   there it is, it's just no fun.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.380]   And the upshot of that?
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.260]   Well, you don't do it, or you do it late,
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.500]   and that means what?
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.300]   You don't get paid, or you don't get paid on time.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.980]   FreshBooks makes it actually actively fun
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.780]   to send out invoices, I know, because I started using it.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.220]   I've been invoicing for years.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.980]   I started using it in 2004 when they started.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.220]   Amber MacArthur told me about them
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.140]   because they're a Toronto company.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.300]   I said, yeah, that's what I need.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.420]   When it started, it was a very web 2.0.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.820]   It still is, a beautiful web 2.0 style site.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.860]   You know, big letters and stuff.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.100]   Easy to figure out, easy to use.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.180]   You upload your logo to them, and you invoice people,
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.420]   they do it by email.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.220]   But of course you can always have invoices printed
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.660]   and stamped for some of the older, bigger companies
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.620]   that I invoiced, I would always get a printed invoice
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.620]   'cause I knew that they would want to see it on paper.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.980]   But, you know, when you're working with people
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.860]   who can handle email, and I guess by now everybody can,
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:33.340]   it's so great 'cause there's a "Pay Me Now" button on that.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.420]   They get the email, they press the button,
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.020]   they can do it so cool, they can do it as a credit card,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.780]   or they have 11 different electronic payment services
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.980]   and you get paid right away.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.940]   And you might say, "Oh, I don't want to be pushy on that."
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.420]   Let me tell you, nine times out of 10,
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.660]   the company just wants to get you out of there.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.540]   It's not that they don't want to give you the money,
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.260]   it's not that they're holding on to the money,
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.220]   it's just a pain, they have to do the same thing
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.460]   that you have to do for invoicing.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.260]   They've got to do all their bills,
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.820]   send out all their bills and stuff,
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.660]   their print out checks, they can press a button,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.580]   they're gonna do it, there's even better.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.500]   They can set up automatic payments.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.220]   You can set up automatic invoices.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.500]   The whole thing, let the computers handle it.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.820]   Thanks to FreshBooks, I love it.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.300]   FreshBooks.com, they did do a survey a couple of years ago
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.380]   of their customers and they said on average
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:18.140]   they get paid two weeks faster when they use FreshBooks.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.820]   'Cause they're actually doing the invoices.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.420]   Yeah, they're doing them, that might be it,
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.940]   oh, right there, so you're like me too.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.860]   I mean, like, I mean, like,
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.220]   I lean it as the invoicing now, right?
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.420]   Oh yeah, Carly does the invoicing now,
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.740]   but when I was doing it, it was like,
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.420]   "Oh, I get around to it and I can't find the format,
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.660]   "I can't find the word doc that had my things,
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.660]   "so I'm gonna go find it and then three weeks we go by."
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.340]   Now, if you do, I know you don't know time
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.940]   and materials or time and hours, but if you do,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.660]   they have an iPhone app that you just enter it in
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.500]   and then when you press a button
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.100]   and it sends it over to the invoice,
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.140]   you get, they have a web version of that as well.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.420]   I mean, there's just a lot of features that make this
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.100]   the best if you're a small business owner,
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.980]   a consultant, a freelancer, anybody who has to send out
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.340]   invoices, by the way, free for the first three clients.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.460]   So for a lot of us, that's enough.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.500]   That's it, free at the door.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.060]   They are, if you sign up today at FreshBooks.com,
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.940]   you'll be in a drawing for a weekly birthday cake giveaway.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.180]   It doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.380]   They're pretty good.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.860]   >> Did you have a FreshBooks birthday cake?
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.900]   >> One of the guys in the office uses FreshBooks
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.180]   for a took a run. >> And he got a cake?
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.140]   He won a cake.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.020]   >> And there was a good cake.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.100]   >> He showed up, but it was a good cake.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.740]   I was like, wow, they really do send out these cakes.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.940]   This was really good. >> Yeah, they showed up
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.900]   the whole opposite. >> It was great.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.740]   >> I love that.

[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:33.700]   >> Moving along in our very truncated agenda,
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.660]   this app, I wish Apple would do more stuff.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:40.180]   There's a new Steve Jobs bio coming out next year.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.900]   Wait a minute, it's the authorized bio.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.620]   Steve finally wants to tell his story.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.500]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.220]   A guy named Walter Isaacson.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.540]   Do a Google on this guy.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.460]   I'd like to know what he's done.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.100]   I mean, Apple PR flak, Walter Isaacson will be writing it.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.580]   No, I don't know, I'm just making that up.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.060]   But that's, I think, I think not surprising.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.700]   In fact, I kind of predicted this when Steve got sick.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.260]   I thought you're going to see,
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.980]   he's going to want to tell his own story.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.820]   Because they always hate these books, the other icon.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.580]   >> He's got to leave that mark.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.700]   >> But he, yeah, he wants his story told.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.700]   Just like Woz, I was, I know Steve wants to tell his story.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.580]   And I'm glad to hear that they've got a writer
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.380]   and they're going to start working on it right now.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.220]   Stryker Rich is telling me that Walter Isaacson
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.700]   is famous for his biography.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.340]   So he's a well-known biographer.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.780]   Do you know the word, the word, "hagiography"?
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.820]   That is a biography that is written
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.820]   to be completely self-promoting and positive about oneself.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.380]   Walter Isaacson is the president and CEO
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.760]   of the Aspen Institute.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.220]   That can't be the same one it is.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.140]   He has been the chairman and CEO of CNN
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.940]   and the managing editor of Time.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.980]   He wrote the, oh, he wrote a great book.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980]   Einstein, The Life of the Universe.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.500]   That was an incredible book.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.060]   Okay, okay.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.660]   American sketches, Benjamin Franklin and Kissinger,
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.380]   a biography.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.580]   So he's worked with sticky egotists before.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:16.340]   So no, this guy actually has a great CV.
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.780]   In fact, that Einstein book was fantastic.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.220]   What is Steve-- >> Do you want it to come right now?
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.100]   >> Well, they're going to work on it next year.
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.020]   I mean, they'll be out next year.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.220]   I guess they're probably working on it right now.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.180]   Do you think, you think Steve, thank you, my brain
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.500]   has once again come through in the lurch, in the lurch?
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.980]   The clutch.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.820]   You should have fixed that brain before I even set it.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.500]   So actually it's interesting because this guy
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.180]   is a former businessman as well as a writer.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.460]   So he's going to have some sympathy.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.060]   >> I'm interested in listening to it.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:45.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.740]   >> That's an audible right there for sure.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.660]   >> I'm calling audible there.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.340]   >> Do you think he'll mention me in his bio?
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.700]   >> Well, then I was out there speaking
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.740]   and I looked out into the-- >> It was the guy.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.420]   >> It was a guy with a laptop open.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.980]   >> Skype is my-- >> My bet noir.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.740]   >> Do I-- >> Hello.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   >> Hello.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.580]   >> I see we meet again.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.780]   >> And I chose to give him the stink guy.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.780]   >> You know what would be great?
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.540]   And I'd like to volunteer to do this right now,
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.820]   audible if you're listening.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.180]   >> You'll read it. >> I will read it.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.780]   And I will read it for free. >> I want that.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.940]   >> I'll read it in a Steve Jobs voice if you want,
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.220]   whatever you want.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.500]   Wouldn't that be good to take--
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.620]   You could see Steve Jobs just blow his top.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.540]   [laughs]
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.100]   I would actually-- I would love to hear the whole story
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.820]   from Steve's point of view because you know this guy
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.140]   is a master strategist.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.620]   I mean he really is brilliant.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.220]   And to hear if-- and I hope, you know,
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.340]   we'll see how candid and, you know,
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.940]   fourth fourth outspoken he is.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.700]   But I would be very interested if he told the real thinking,
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.620]   well let me tell you why I got mad at Adobe
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.580]   and had it in one final cut, you know.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.100]   If he really starts to tell those stories,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.900]   sometimes somebody who's, you know,
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.140]   coming to the end of his life and really wants the truth,
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.620]   you know, sometimes they are brutally honest.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.500]   >> What really happened with the Microsoft deal?
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.780]   >> Exactly.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.340]   When Bill Gates showed up on that screen with $100 million--
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.700]   >> There was something else going on in the background.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.540]   >> You bet.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.380]   >> What was it?
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.380]   >> There's so many tales he could tell.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.820]   What would you like to know?
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.740]   What's secret?
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:05.900]   Handy, what's secrets?
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.620]   >> I was actually just saying here thinking that
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.380]   I don't really want a biographer to write it.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.100]   I want Steve to write it on his iPhone as Steve Mails.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:12.700]   >> Nope.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.900]   >> Yep. I just wanted to be like, you know,
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.940]   two sentence chapters.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.620]   >> And then I invented Apple.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.340]   >> Adobe was done.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   I moved on next.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.340]   [laughs]
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.540]   Microsoft was wrong.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.620]   >> Okay, when the biography comes out--
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.540]   >> You can write the parody.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.140]   >> I'll read it.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.220]   >> Nope.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:30.980]   Adobe?
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   Nope.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.180]   [laughs]
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.060]   How about you, Alex?
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.260]   Are there any secrets you would like to know?
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   I like that Microsoft.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.100]   That's a good one.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.180]   >> I'm actually really curious because I, you know,
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.260]   there's a lot of rumors around that there were a lot
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.420]   of other things going on there.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.580]   And I look-- that's the thing that to me is mysterious.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.540]   Because he came back in and pulled an awful lot of deals
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.020]   together really quickly.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.020]   And it's very curious--
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.460]   >> He had just rejoined the company, right?
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:51.780]   What happened?
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.220]   >> And they got $100 million investment from 150--
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   >> 150 and--
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.060]   >> A bunch of other stuff.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.420]   And they got five-year promise on--
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   >> On office?
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.420]   Which is still, you know, they're still doing office.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.620]   I mean, it was the big product for Microsoft.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.380]   But remember, Bill Gates up on that screen
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.740]   with that little smug smile.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.180]   And you know, just looking at Bill,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.540]   there was something going on behind me.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.860]   That was an interesting deal.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.100]   Well, I hope that we can hope that this will be
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.180]   an honest biography.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.060]   Steve Jobs also-- I guess it's from Steve.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.620]   Let me look at this-- the source of this story.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:37.900]   Wifi syncing on an iPod using something called carbon fiber.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.500]   Does this ring a bell with anybody?
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.060]   Hmm.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.540]   Let me see if I can find the-- find this story.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.420]   I saw this, I saw a link to it.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.260]   I think the chat room gave me this link.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.580]   Let me go back.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.980]   Well, we're kind of working blind here.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.740]   I apologize to everyone.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:57.460]   >> So long show.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.540]   We've been up here for a long-- we've been out of here
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.820]   a log log time.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.420]   >> Well, future iPods may be made of carbon fiber
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.060]   and boast of Wifi syncing.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   >> Yes.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:13.420]   >> Is this a rumor or was it stimulated by a leak rumor?
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.460]   >> Here it is, from the Lander Connie in the Cult of Mac.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.260]   Thank you, chat room for that story.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.380]   >> See, you guys have iPads.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.700]   You're smart.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.740]   I'm trying to do this on the iPad Jr.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   >> I almost started-- I started trying to do it on the iPhone
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.820]   and I looked over at Andy's and I'm like, what am I thinking?
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.060]   I left everything in the room.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.100]   I don't know.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:37.380]   Apple is prototyping iPods with carbon fiber cases.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:43.140]   They-- Leander says, Steve is keen to bring wireless syncing
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.020]   to iPods this year.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.740]   He ought to be because all--
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.580]   Why are we not?
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:47.140]   >> Why not?
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.740]   Everything else did and does, including the zoom, the late
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.020]   late unlimited zoom.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:57.300]   Apparently, Apple has hired a carbon fiber expert.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:02.100]   We can reveal, apparently Leander's got some inside sources,
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.140]   that the company has been testing Wifi syncing on iPods
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.380]   for two years.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.100]   >> They really got to get past that point
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.180]   where you have to plug it into a Mac in order just to start
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.180]   to initialize the whole process.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.540]   Like the iPads and the iPhones, they have to get to a point
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.060]   where they just turn on and work out of the box.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.060]   That's one of the whole backs that--
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.900]   >> Well, I don't see how you can call this the post-PC era
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:29.100]   if you can't use the damn thing unless you connect it to a PC.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.220]   >> I don't get that.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.580]   >> I don't get it either.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.580]   There are lots of issues Leander says with syncing over the air.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:38.220]   Apple engineers have been having trouble with reliability,
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.220]   signal strength, case design and battery life.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.660]   Well, I'll grant you all of that.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.740]   I have over the years syncing on all my Android phones
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.740]   using a variety of different programs like Double Twist.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.860]   And it's certainly not a way to get a large library
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.980]   onto a phone.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.380]   It would be okay for time to time, you know,
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.940]   occasional updating, but it's not ideal.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:02.060]   I wonder though, with Amazon Cloud Player,
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.620]   if they ever get that for iOS, or apps like MOG
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.940]   and RDO and Rhapsody, if we even want to put music
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.380]   on our devices going forward.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.940]   This is, I wonder really what the future of the iPod is in general.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.020]   If everybody has an iPhone with--
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.860]   >> I have to admit that I still--
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.020]   >> You have an iPod.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:24.220]   >> No, I have an iPhone, but I still listen to the music
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.060]   on my iPhone.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.500]   >> Well, you like to buy music.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.980]   But I-- >> No, no, no, I don't like--
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.060]   >> I mean, you like to own it.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:29.900]   I mean, you like to own it.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.100]   >> I got a Zoom because I didn't want to own it,
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:32.940]   but what I didn't-- >> Right.
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.700]   >> But every time I was with a Zoom,
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:40.340]   you couldn't, you would find out that your 30-day thing
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.300]   can run up and it wants to renegotiate your--
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.100]   you know whatever, to share that you page--
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.420]   >> You have to connect. >> --the 1495.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.420]   So you have to connect, and then you can't connect over Wi-Fi.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.540]   You have to plug it into your computer,
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.460]   and I'm like in London.
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:56.260]   And the computer that it was connected to is in San Francisco.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.100]   >> Right.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.820]   >> And so after that, I just put the Zoom away
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.460]   and I was like, okay, get it.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.860]   >> So they hired this guy, Kenny Kestrel.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.620]   He's the former president of Kestrel Bicycles.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.340]   He's like the guy-- >> The guy.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.580]   >> --on Kuyman's fiber.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.340]   And the reason carbon fiber is Wi-Fi goes through it
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.740]   as opposed to the cases that they're using,
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.860]   the metal or the plastic cases that they're using.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.700]   >> So do we think that it'll-- I guess I wonder
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.740]   if it'll improve our cell strength as well.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.580]   >> Well, wouldn't it be great?
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:22.620]   And carbon fiber is tough.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.900]   I lie, I like carbon fiber.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.660]   >> It's fine, but what we use the phone for, I'm sure--
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.540]   >> Better than glass.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.740]   >> It probably bounces.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:32.620]   Apparently Steve Jobs recently sent an email to a customer
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.660]   saying the iPod classic is not going away.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.980]   We thought it might be.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.940]   >> It's a one-of-a-kind.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.540]   >> I have one. >> So--
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:41.940]   >> This is kind of following on a long time conversation
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.620]   on this show, September.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.180]   Normally they announce iPods.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.980]   We thought maybe they'd announce iPhone 5 in September.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.500]   Concurrent with iPod announcement.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.980]   Or maybe not even do any more iPods.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.540]   But if you're going to make it out of carbon fiber,
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.340]   that'd be pretty cool.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.740]   >> Oh, they're still a market for iPods.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.140]   I mean, they're still-- >> There is.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.340]   >> There's still plenty of-- >> They still sell them.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.460]   >> Oh, yeah. >> The market's down a little bit.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.420]   A lot more iPod touches than iPods.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.180]   >> Right, right. >> And that's true.
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:13.740]   I mean-- >> Go ahead.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.700]   >> Mm-hmm. >> Look at that.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.540]   >> So, X-Nite says the iPod cardboard
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.860]   would have excellent Wi-Fi characteristics.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.700]   >> Slightly flammable. (laughing)
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.860]   But it would work as long as you didn't get it near the stove.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:28.100]   And didn't get it sub-y.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   >> I just think that the future is a 3G or 4G-enabled device,
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.820]   whether it's your phone or not,
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.820]   that streams music from these services,
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.780]   I know you like to own the copy,
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.700]   but I don't know if you can call owning a digital copy,
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:42.980]   owning it anyway.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.380]   >> I don't like to own the copy.
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.740]   It's just that I spend a lot of time when I'm not connected.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.100]   >> Right. >> Because it's becoming less and less--
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.340]   >> Well, all of those services allow you to download--
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.900]   >> And download caps. Those are the two big problems.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.540]   >> And with caps. >> And with caps.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.780]   >> Absolutely. >> And with the big one.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.620]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:59.580]   But all of those services allow you to download copies
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.660]   for offline purposes.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:03.220]   Mogg, Rhapsody, and Artio, all three of them.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.420]   >> Right. >> I'm using Mogg lately.
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.020]   You know, it's funny, I was talking about Artio,
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.580]   you know I've talked about it on this show.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.140]   R-D-I-O, these are all three iPhone apps,
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.660]   or you can listen on your computer
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:18.260]   or your other device, if it has an Android, perhaps,
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:19.620]   something like that.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.060]   Sonos even supports Rhapsody and Artio,
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.460]   and apparently Mogg soon.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.580]   The reason I moved to Moggs,
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.460]   I'm gonna be on the Twitter verse,
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.540]   said you should try Mogg, 320 kilobits.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.780]   Streaming. >> Wow.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.140]   >> Talk about bandwidth cap problems.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:33.980]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.540]   320 kilobits, so it really sounds good.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.620]   Artio will not tell people what the stream rate is,
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.060]   which it sounds to me like it's the same.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.900]   >> It's not a good sign.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.580]   >> They say it's seed equality.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.700]   >> Sounds like 96 kilobits to me, kids.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.140]   Is there anything else to talk about
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.380]   before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.860]   This is a scant show today.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.300]   We might actually do an hour long Mac break weekly.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.140]   >> It's crazy. >> Wow.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.340]   >> No, no, forget it.
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.100]   Say it isn't so, wait till we get to the picks.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.900]   (laughing)
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.540]   Yeah, 'cause there's quite a few things out here
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.780]   and we might want to pick.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.740]   >> Alex has been chopping.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.780]   Am I a bit drooling?
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.060]   Oh man, if I were a billionaire,
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.860]   I'd come to a conference like this.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.860]   >> I would have two.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.700]   >> And I just, well you know,
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.580]   I imagine Scott Bourne doing something like that.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.260]   Just coming here and saying, yeah,
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.100]   that, that, that, have it delivered tomorrow.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.780]   And you could build such a cool studio.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.940]   I was talking about this before the,
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.780]   before we did the show.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.300]   Ultimate, you know that, green screen guys.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.060]   They have a big green screen cove there.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.940]   And Accuweather, who provides weather information
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.180]   to television stations.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180]   And actually, I didn't know this,
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.580]   but I guess they do a lot of technology for these TV stations.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.980]   So the weather forecaster can stand
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.380]   in front of a green screen and stuff.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.220]   They were demonstrating,
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.060]   you've got to go over and see this.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.580]   It's both in the Altamat and the AccuView booth.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.260]   They're, you know, a few hundred feet apart,
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.020]   but the idea is you could do this anywhere.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.780]   They've got a woman in front of a screen,
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.780]   not a green screen, a projection screen
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.100]   in the Altamat booth.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.660]   A guy in front of the same projection screen
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.860]   in the Accuweather booth.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.820]   And they merge the two together
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.860]   and they look like they're standing in the same set.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.180]   They can interact with the digital screen
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.980]   so they can drag things around.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.580]   They can throw digital objects at each other.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.100]   They talk to each other.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.380]   It's really an interesting virtual set technology
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.220]   because the two people can be in different places,
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.580]   but look like they're standing,
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.620]   like you and I are right now next to each other.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.180]   In fact, I think Alex, you are actually at the Accuweather booth.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.700]   >> Well, I am, I didn't want to tell you.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.500]   I didn't know you knew you.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.380]   >> I think that's, I would buy that right now.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.260]   >> No, because Skyposaurus, that's the new Skyposaurus, right?
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.700]   It's pricey.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.540]   >> Is it?
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.380]   >> Well, there's a lot of it.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.220]   >> I'll go check it out.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.940]   I can tell you if you're starting to sync those things up,
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.780]   it's not going to be $10.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.780]   >> No.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   >> So, they're in a world of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:54.460]   solutions, but what is exciting here is to see,
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.420]   a lot of these--
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.300]   >> Artio, by the way, says it streams at 256 kilobits.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.140]   I apologize.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.340]   I thought that they did not say
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.140]   because I was trying to find out.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.980]   Go ahead.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.980]   >> But this is like the next step from what CNN did
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.780]   with a holographic person.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.380]   It's the same idea except they're not glowing.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.820]   >> Well, that telepresence of telepresence.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.660]   >> Telepresence.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.500]   >> I was talking to an engineer in Canada,
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.860]   and he said they have a central control unit,
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.300]   I think in Vancouver.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.220]   And all these little towns in Canada
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.060]   that are too small to have a staff,
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.620]   they literally have remote control cameras
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.500]   and the host is sitting on a green screen,
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.700]   and it's going back in real time.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.580]   So, you gotta get, it goes in green screen
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.980]   from the studio to the central hub in Vancouver,
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.860]   where it's keyed, edited, all the stuff is added to it,
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.820]   and then it gets pushed back to them,
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.580]   and then transmitted locally for the local TV network.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.420]   >> Wow.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   >> So, the thing is, and all there is is like a person
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.780]   and someone who turns the room on.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.380]   You know, that's the--
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.020]   >> Well, that's what I need, actually.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.580]   For my house in Cancun.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.460]   So, anyway, it's crazy.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.940]   And you're seeing all those technologies,
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.260]   and a lot of them are really expensive right now,
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.740]   but the technology you're talking about,
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.940]   five years from now,
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.180]   something you and I can actually--
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.020]   >> Well, that's Ford.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.380]   >> Truthfully, and that's what I look at this stuff,
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.380]   and I go, well, now I know you can't do it.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.420]   Let's watch and see how long before I can afford to.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.980]   >> And let's figure out how we can do most of it.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:22.060]   >> You know, we are doing--
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.180]   >> I mean, somebody in the chair said,
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.980]   "Well, you could use a split screen, and you can."
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.340]   But the idea is to make it look like we're doing,
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.380]   so the problem is most of our hosts are not in Petaluma.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:33.940]   So we have them on via Skype.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.700]   It'd be great if we could have a round table show
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.820]   where everybody looks like they're sitting at the table,
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.180]   except they're not.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.900]   We're working on that.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.340]   We're gonna take a break, come back with your picks.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.060]   I don't know, Andy, do you wanna do a pick for us?
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.020]   Hardware software, you pick something you like.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.340]   >> I found all my compression apps,
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.180]   so I've got a couple of--
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.180]   >> Oh, good, that's great.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.900]   That's actually a really good $14.95.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.860]   >> Actually, it's $9.95.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.300]   >> $9.95.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.060]   Coming up, just a little bit,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.780]   but first I'd like to thank our good friends at gazelle.com.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.260]   I know you're eyeing those new gear, that new stuff.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.780]   Maybe you'd like to get a new gadget or a gizmo.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.460]   Maybe you were holding off on the iPhone,
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.100]   you wanna get a Verizon iPhone 4.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.380]   Maybe you've got an iPad 1
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.900]   and you just were hungry for an iPad 2,
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.980]   but you were thinking, "Well, really, this is for you, Andy.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.860]   "You're using iPad 1 there, and that don't okay."
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.740]   So I recognize it.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.980]   Maybe I could get an iPad 2
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.540]   if I could just get a decent price for my iPad 1
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.380]   and subsidize it,
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.340]   well, let me tell you about gazelle.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.180]   G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com,
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.140]   just like the sprinter on the African felt.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.420]   Right, that's a gazelle.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.300]   It's like an ungulate.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.140]   >> This is very fast.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:40.980]   >> Okay.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.620]   (laughing)
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.580]   >> It's very fast.
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.380]   >> You see the horns and the gazelle logo?
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.220]   That's the gazelle.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.340]   It's got this stripey horns up there.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   Anyway, gazelle is a great company.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.940]   I think they're so cool,
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.420]   and we know a lot of people who use them, I've used them.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.660]   I get tweets a lot, and emails a lot for people
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.140]   said, "Hey, I heard about gazelle on the Mac break weekly,
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.500]   "and I tried it, and this is really awesome."
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.660]   If you've got a gadget,
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.700]   we all do line around that you're not using anymore.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.940]   Go to G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com,
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.340]   and enter in that gadget.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.820]   They do all sorts of kind of smart phones,
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.260]   MP3 players, e-book readers, laptops, cameras,
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.660]   gaming consoles, GPS,
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.780]   it's thousands of over 200,000 different unique items
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.460]   in 20 categories.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.620]   They will tell you what it's worth.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.260]   They even show you, it's really fun to graph
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.020]   as the value has gone up and down,
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.500]   so you can see if it's starting to plummet.
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.660]   Maybe it's the time now,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.820]   is now to get rid of that old device.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.660]   They'll tell you what it's worth.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.540]   They'll ask you some questions about its condition and so forth.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.860]   They will give you a mailing label,
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.220]   you put in a box, you put the label,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.100]   they pay the postage,
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.620]   and it goes to the gazelle experts.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.540]   Now, they do a couple of things.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.180]   First of all, they validate that it is
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.820]   in the condition you said it is.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.540]   Believe it or not,
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   of course, sometimes they'll say,
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.980]   "No, it's not, I'm gonna give you less money,"
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.140]   but often, and they don't need to do this,
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.260]   but they do,
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.500]   I've heard people many times say,
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.260]   "Yeah, I got more money than they said they would give me,"
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.380]   'cause it was in better condition than I thought.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.540]   >> You were just being conservative.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.980]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.100]   So they really are,
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.500]   and they're really a conscientious company this way.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.100]   They'll also wipe data.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.420]   So if you send them something that has data on it,
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.260]   they understand that,
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.300]   they understand it's complicated,
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.140]   they do it for you,
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.460]   so you don't have to worry about your data.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.500]   And then they send you a check,
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.340]   or you can get a credit from a variety of PayPal,
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.220]   Amazon, Walmart gift cards.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.580]   Actually, if you do the Amazon gift card,
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.220]   this is a little tip.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.900]   You get a 5% bonus on the cash value,
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.540]   'cause Amazon, I think, gives them an affiliate fee
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.420]   or whatever, so that, you get even more,
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.300]   and I'm gonna tell you in a second how you get even more.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.700]   Let's say you hear, you want this Kindle.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.540]   You want the new Kindle,
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.900]   you want the advertising-based $150 Kindle.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.740]   I bet your old Kindle's worth more than that.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.020]   You might be able to actually get a net gain
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.860]   on the whole thing.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.140]   Go over there to gazelle.com.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.100]   And by the way, if it's something that they can't,
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.860]   it has no value if it's a Palm Pilot,
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.980]   something like that.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.140]   They recycle it conscientiously.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.340]   They use green recycling, so, you know,
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.940]   they don't export it, it doesn't go in the landfill,
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.860]   they don't use, you know, any companies
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.260]   that don't do it right, they have to be EPA certified,
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.660]   have an environmental management system.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.540]   Their cloud blue is their primary recycler right now,
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.060]   and really, they're band certified, they're really great.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.260]   So it's a good way to recycle.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.260]   And if you have a charity,
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.340]   I just got an email from a friend.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.260]   Oh, I got it.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.580]   >> My wife and I actually did this.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.700]   We are adopting from Ethiopia,
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.860]   and we set up a page, and our friends and family donated--
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.700]   >> To raise money.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.540]   >> To raise money.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.380]   >> Through gazelle.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.220]   >> For the adoption.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.260]   >> Isn't that, that's such a cool story.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.460]   So you tell friends and family, there's a gazelle page,
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.420]   and if you've got an old gadget, just donate it,
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.100]   send it, they pay the postage, you get the check.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.940]   Did you raise the money that you needed?
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.060]   >> Well, it's a lot of money to adopt.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:44.900]   >> But you got some.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.420]   >> We definitely got, it definitely helped.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.260]   >> Isn't that neat?
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.100]   >> Absolutely.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.660]   >> It's an easy way for friends and family to help you,
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.540]   and clear out their closets at the same time.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.380]   So there you go.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.220]   >> It's way better than just asking them for money.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.060]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.260]   Unsolicited testimonial from Andy.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.060]   Gazelle.com now.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.300]   Here's how you get an extra 5%.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   On checkout, use the bonus code MAC break,
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.220]   and they'll just take whatever amount they said,
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.300]   and add 5% to it.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.860]   So I just told you how to do 10%,
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.180]   because you can take an Amazon car plus the 5%.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.060]   I think those two could be operated at the same time.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.780]   I'm sure they can.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.300]   Gazelle.com, don't sell it.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.420]   Gazelle.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.740]   All right, time for our picks of the week,
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.780]   and we're going to start with Andy.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.620]   >> Okay.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.580]   >> From, is it SeaWell?
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.420]   >> SeaWell Network.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.860]   >> What does SeaWell do?
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.540]   >> So, I mean, I'm a video geek from way back,
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.140]   and like, yeah, I wrote a book on it,
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:41.500]   and at the moment I'm working on technology with these guys,
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.620]   they're a startup that are doing new technology
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.900]   for adaptive bit rate streaming.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.860]   So they're trying to make it easier and faster
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:49.460]   to work on that stuff to deliver it out.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.420]   So make it easier for you to deliver your content to--
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.380]   >> So you can consult with people and help them.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.660]   >> Yeah, right now I'm doing all of their marketing
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.980]   and some of the product stuff as well,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:01.300]   and just helping get that stuff across,
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.740]   'cause it's like, for the longest time I was working on,
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.220]   like, stuff for individuals to use in their home environments,
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.060]   or like, studio environments like you have,
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.020]   and it's slowly just gotten to the point
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.140]   where I'm working on big infrastructure projects.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.740]   So it's really cool, it's fun.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.140]   >> Yeah.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   S-E-A-W-E-L-L-E networks.com.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:27.300]   So Andy Beach is also, as Alex says, a compression guru.
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.780]   >> Andy, Andy's, so when people are asking me about,
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.900]   well, I do a lot of live streaming,
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.300]   and I have to deal with compression all the time,
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.380]   and even for post, and the person that I call
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.300]   when I'm trying to figure something out is Andy.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.260]   >> Wow. >> Like, I don't know
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.220]   how to do this until Andy's the guy I call.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.340]   >> Well, you found your, he was mentioning earlier,
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.540]   compression applications you found.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.940]   >> I kind of use everything, and so this one is my pick,
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.620]   but I'll also caveat and say,
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:52.580]   I use episode six, episode pro from Telestream,
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.100]   because it's great, and it, like,
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.340]   all compression tools have different functionality for me.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.420]   I also use X-break and X264 plugins,
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.980]   because those have great uses.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.300]   It's all about, like, whether I need speed, quality,
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.660]   or some sort of compatibility.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.500]   >> So there's no, it's a shame.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.700]   There's no one magic.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.680]   >> There never is. >> There is.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.740]   But this is the one, if, this is the one
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.700]   that even my wife can use if she wants
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.980]   to quickly convert something,
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.980]   and if I just want to get something to play back
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.140]   on my TV, on my desktop, on my phone, my iPad,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.380]   even give it to a friend to play back on some other device,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.020]   this is the one, and it's just super friendly,
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.540]   and it's been, again, it's one of those that, like,
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.260]   you know, a lot of those that I named out there,
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.900]   they could be $1,000 apps, right?
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.500]   >> This one is $9.95.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.860]   I got it through the app store originally.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.100]   It's actually available, of course,
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.900]   from download from his site, too.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.100]   It's called IVI, and it's made by someone called
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.180]   South Pole Software.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.020]   >> I've dimly remembered hearing about this,
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.220]   and so it's I-Video importer,
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.300]   and what I really like about it is,
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.140]   they're used to, back in, you know,
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.220]   one of the first good FFmpeg gooies was visual hub.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.500]   >> Right. >> That was the super easy
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.460]   visual hub. >> Oh, we really missed that.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.300]   Love that.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.140]   I covered it in my book.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.100]   This is like the modern version of visual hub, if you will,
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.380]   but it's even gone further,
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.260]   because you're able to set up watch folders
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.580]   and automate things and have it do that extra level of things.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.980]   You can also, if you're importing off of a disc,
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.100]   and handle the subtitles,
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.660]   I can do the multi-language.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:20.460]   It'll reach out to databases and grab all the metadata,
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.220]   so it's tagged appropriately,
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.860]   as particularly if you're doing like a whole season
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.700]   of TV shows, like I'm just getting ready
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.740]   to take a 40 hour flight to Africa.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.500]   >> Wow. >> So I just dumped a lot
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:34.220]   of my DVD TV episodes onto my computer,
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.740]   so that I could be ready for that trip.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.620]   So-- >> This sounds like it's worth--
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.980]   >> I mean, for $9.95. >> $9.95.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.020]   It'll even do, it does 5.1 pass through,
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.380]   but it'll also do a mix down to stereo.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.860]   So if you have some really good 5.1
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.460]   and you want to have stereo,
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.340]   you can pass that along.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.540]   It's really great.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.940]   I mean, for what it does,
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.860]   and they're super attentive,
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.020]   the one thing that it was lacking in the early days of it,
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.100]   being a compression geek,
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.460]   there's a lot of advanced controls
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.140]   and things that I like that are under the point.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:03.980]   >> I don't need those.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.020]   >> Because when hand breaks says,
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.580]   you don't really want to go there, do you?
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:07.420]   >> That's where I go.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.860]   >> That's the one. >> And so I emailed their support,
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.540]   and I said, "Boy, it'd be great if you exposed these
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.660]   "three things for me,"
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.900]   because those are the kinds of things.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.700]   And within two weeks, he said,
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.900]   "Okay, here's a new registration,
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.980]   "and this is the new pro version.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.940]   "Do you want to try the beta of it?
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.980]   "Check it out."
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.860]   And it worked great.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.740]   It was awesome. >> It's awesome.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.100]   >> It's awesome. >> I V I.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.940]   And it's $9.99 from the App Store,
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.660]   and I'm going to get it right now.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.500]   That sounds great.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.340]   Thank you.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.140]   Yeah, you're pickling.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.180]   You could take your time.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.180]   >> Too many. >> Yeah, go ahead.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.660]   >> You could take-- do the whole shopping list.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.940]   >> Yeah, I got two.
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.180]   I got one for the iPad,
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.860]   and one hardware one from any V.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.460]   >> Awesome. >> So the first one I want to--
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.260]   that I'm going to recommend,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:51.260]   and I tested this heavily in Paris last week.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.540]   There's a lot of mapping software.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.060]   So, you know, here's the issue,
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.620]   is you go to another country,
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.060]   and now you are stuck with 50 megabytes.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.100]   And you think that 50 megabytes
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.980]   is going to be a lot of transfer time.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.140]   And in like three days or one day,
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.020]   you've used up almost all of your time
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.540]   just using Google Maps.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.980]   Google Maps is great when you're not paying per megabyte.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.180]   So, what you want to do is find something
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.180]   that will load the entire Paris map,
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.500]   or France map to your iPhone,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   and just simply use GPS, which you're not paying for.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.860]   So you can turn off your roaming.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.940]   And I'm going to get people the more expensive solution
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.940]   because I bought all of the cheap ones.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.020]   >> I have a way to do it too.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.060]   >> Okay, so I--
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.340]   >> Well, you can tell me,
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.180]   because here's what I did,
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.140]   is I bought all the cheap ones,
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.300]   and they're all using the same map, it's really bad.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.460]   So it's the same open source map that they got,
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:41.300]   and all of it--
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.140]   >> Yeah, because you can't send
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.860]   low Google Maps for free, you have to pay for that.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.420]   >> Well, and so I bit the bullet,
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.940]   and I bought, it's not on this phone,
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.340]   but I bought Tom Tom--
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.060]   >> Tom Tom, 100 bucks.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.060]   >> And it is awesome.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.900]   >> Oh, you love it.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.100]   >> Oh, I think Tom Tom, well, here's the deal,
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.780]   is I get a great map, it totally works,
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.300]   it does all the stuff that it does.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.340]   I use Tom Tom a lot when I'm driving already,
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.220]   because I find that I'm paying a lot of money for it,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.740]   or a lot of money from the comparison too,
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.660]   but I find that all the lower cost ones
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.500]   have been this kind of hack.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.420]   >> Did you try GPS motion X?
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:18.220]   >> I did when they first came out,
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.100]   and it was not a great experience.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.100]   >> It's, but it might have been true.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:21.940]   >> But it's open street maps,
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.940]   so it depends on where you are, it's not Google,
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.380]   it's not tele-mav, it's--
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.460]   >> 'Cause you'd have to pay for those.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.300]   So open street maps is an open source mapping solution.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.140]   But Randall Schwartz showed me this,
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.860]   every time he goes on a cruise to a town,
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:39.140]   he'll download ahead of time the maps from that area.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.540]   >> I think it's sometimes open street maps
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.060]   is actually better because--
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.660]   >> That's not the map, that actually looks like
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.300]   a better map than when I've been digging through Paris.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.140]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.420]   >> Very unhappy.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.780]   >> Yeah, no, but maybe open street maps
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.460]   doesn't have as good a,
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.660]   you know, it's basically user created content,
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.180]   if they've gotten better and better all the time,
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.380]   it's a great open source project.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.940]   And these are free, so you download,
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:03.020]   it's a 99 cent application,
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.380]   and the maps are free,
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.660]   you just download them ahead of time,
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.860]   and store it on the phone.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.980]   >> But you like Tom Tom.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.900]   >> So Tom Tom, you get turned by turn with Tom Tom.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:10.780]   >> Well you get turned by turn,
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.700]   and you have a map that really is,
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.140]   I mean, you're paying for someone,
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.380]   someone actually went through and started--
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.220]   >> It's a real map, yeah.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.940]   >> And it all actually works when you--
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.100]   >> Was it a different map for Europe and US?
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.180]   >> Yeah, so you buy, you actually buy,
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.620]   you can buy Europe, you know,
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.260]   Western and Eastern Europe,
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.540]   or you can buy Europe, or you can buy,
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.940]   there's parts of Africa now that have it.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.940]   So what happened is in December,
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.340]   they started releasing all these individual apps
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.700]   for all these different areas all over the world,
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.140]   for a long time it was only the US and Canada.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.100]   And I have to say,
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.940]   and I got the US and Canada one when it first came out,
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.060]   'cause I had a Tom Tom device,
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.380]   and I was like, oh, I really like,
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.740]   I like the interface, I like the Tom Tom interface.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.500]   And so, and some people don't, but I like it.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.940]   And I really, when I saw the price,
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:49.820]   and I looked at all these free ones,
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.220]   I was like, I can't justify the price,
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.940]   I'm gonna buy these, I'm gonna download these free ones,
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.260]   and by the second day I was like,
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.460]   I'm gonna go ahead and buy the Tom Tom one,
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.060]   because what I kept on doing is like,
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.260]   this isn't working, I'm now going to open Google Maps,
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.300]   and use up three megabytes,
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.700]   so I can figure out where I actually am.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.540]   - Right.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.820]   - You know, and so, I guess there are a lot of free ones,
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:08.940]   and this one may work really well,
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.820]   and I just haven't tested it.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.140]   - Well, the chat rooms agreeing with you,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.740]   they love Tom Tom, and they say for Paris it's very good.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.620]   - And I guess what I'd say is permission critical.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.780]   Like I really, - Right, 'cause they're
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.380]   - in ravalling maps, you don't know what you're gonna get,
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.220]   and I think if you go to Africa with OpenStreet Maps,
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.220]   you might be taking a big game.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.820]   - Well, we're not only that, if you're gonna go to,
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.860]   anywhere that the Tom Tom's covering,
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.500]   it's not covering everywhere now.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.300]   But where it's covering it, here's the deal,
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.940]   I'm gonna spend $3,000 to get somewhere.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.340]   I might as well spend another hundred,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.260]   if my flight was $100 more, - Absolutely more.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.260]   - If my flight was $100 more,
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.380]   I wouldn't even know this. - It's full economy,
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.740]   in some way. - I wouldn't even notice.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.100]   But there is so much stress that's created being lost
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.060]   in the middle of Paris, trying to figure out
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.460]   why I came up on here and I don't know where I'm at,
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.860]   and so on and so forth, and walking, you know,
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.860]   eight extra blocks 'cause you went the wrong way by one,
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.380]   and it's just great to just have a great map.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.300]   So anyway, if you're looking for a real mission critical,
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.820]   if you find the location that you're going to
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.220]   just Tom Tom, I would highly suggest it.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.660]   Now the, because we're here at NAB,
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.340]   I feel like I should recommend one.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.860]   - Would you please, just one very expensive,
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.660]   multi-alex. - Oh, thank you.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.100]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.460]   you have to.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.460]   - So my, my, - I mean, I just talked
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:21.180]   about the Ultimat, $250,000 telepresence system,
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.620]   you gotta, you can do that.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.780]   - Okay, so. - So the,
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:29.180]   so my, I think my pick,
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.540]   see now I wanna pick a couple.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:37.100]   So my pick for the week is actually gonna be the.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.500]   - Pick a couple. - Okay, pick a couple.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.900]   One is on the video editing, what I showed you yesterday.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.940]   So this is Blackmagic's editing system.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.660]   It, what is, what I think is really interesting about it is,
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.260]   is that it breaks the mold.
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.340]   So in the past, what we've done is we bought a mixer.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.940]   You know, we buy a mixer, you have a control surface,
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.860]   you have the inputs, you have all the, you know,
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.340]   the graphics going in, and what Blackmagic has done
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.900]   has allowed you to grab any part that you want.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.860]   I can buy just the interface that's gonna interface
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.860]   with the cameras, I can control that with a laptop.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.220]   But if I really wanna have that control surface,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.060]   I can buy that too.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.140]   And so it's broken it all up, changed the entire,
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.900]   I hate to say it, I don't have a better word, paradigm,
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:17.140]   but changed the entire way that you think about live mixing
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.180]   and made it really inexpensive.
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:22.340]   You can get four HDMI plus two SDI streams,
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.020]   I mean cameras hooked to a little one-year rack
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.180]   and control it with your laptop for 995 bucks.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.380]   >> I thought it was five.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.580]   >> That's the little one that's just four inputs.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.420]   >> Oh, okay.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.220]   >> So if you want 12 SDI inputs and four HDMI inputs,
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.060]   that's gonna cost you $5,000.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:43.260]   But I have a 16 channel mixer that costs me 26,000.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.500]   >> So, no, these are amazing effects.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.780]   I think you're right, this changes everything.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.380]   'Cause we use a TriCaster, $25,000 TriCaster
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.300]   we're using right now, and this doesn't have
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.820]   all the functionality of that,
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:59.300]   but for quick field shooting, we have four cameras.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   I'm using a laptop, it's doing H.264.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.060]   >> This is amazing.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.100]   >> It's an amazing solution.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.460]   The other amazing solution.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.820]   >> I want you to buy one, tell me how it works.
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.420]   >> Before I get one.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.300]   >> You're my guinea pig.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.460]   >> I'm working on it, I'm working on it.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.540]   >> So, I'm waiting for them,
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.740]   they should be releasing the next couple months.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.740]   The other one that I was really excited about
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.220]   was Sound Devices, I brought that over,
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.820]   it's a portable recorder.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.900]   And it is--
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.140]   >> It is, talk about this before actually.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.940]   >> We didn't talk about it, but yeah, we talked about it.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:26.820]   >> I thought it was a pick.
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.660]   You did a Sound Devices pick before.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.860]   >> But this is a video recorder.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.780]   >> Oh, it's video, that was audio the last one.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:34.260]   >> Sound Devices, up until yesterday.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.100]   >> They were audio.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.260]   >> They were an audio company,
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.460]   and they still are an audio company.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.300]   So what you get is great audio.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.020]   Total control over the audio, great limiters,
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.660]   you have all the things that you want out of that,
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:46.020]   but on top of that, you've got SDI and HDMI inputs,
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.460]   time code, and it's all done.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.340]   >> So, does this replace the KeyPro, for instance,
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.580]   which is what we use to record,
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.740]   what we're using right now to record?
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.220]   >> It is a competitive to the KeyPro.
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.020]   >> How much do we pay for that KeyPro?
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:56.860]   >> $5,000.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.180]   >> $4,000.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.740]   >> It is a different version of that.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.100]   The KeyPro does things that it doesn't do.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.060]   So the KeyPro does up-down cross solutions.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.140]   Up-down cross solutions.
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.020]   There's a bunch of things that the KeyPro does do
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.020]   as far as in-and-out puts that are not done.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.580]   But what I will say is that in the portable device,
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.220]   it's got an LCD screen.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.540]   You can use any SSD drive and just drop it in.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.740]   It is a, and it's built, we have so much sound device
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.580]   to stuff in our office.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.100]   It's built to last.
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.620]   >> Those really seem robust.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620]   >> They are always robust.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.820]   And so, anyway, those are the two of the things
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:35.020]   that I have been pretty darn excited about.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.260]   So those are my picks from N.B.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.220]   >> Okay.
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.060]   >> How about you, Leo?
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:41.900]   >> Okay. >> What did you say?
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.740]   >> You got Leo.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.020]   >> By the way, the chair I'm saying it's $3.99 for your IVI.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.140]   >> Yeah, and I was looking at that,
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.340]   and I double-checked the site.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:51.420]   So there's a kind of a dumb-down version,
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.020]   a little slightly more simple version
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.540]   that doesn't have some of the subtitling
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.700]   and the mixed-down stuff.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.060]   That's the $3.99 version.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.540]   And it's just IVI.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:02.340]   Then there's IVI Pro, which is $9.95.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.500]   >> So you're recommending Pro.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.180]   >> So right now, I would actually,
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.580]   I would recommend either if you want the subtitling,
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:11.660]   the one nice thing, IVI, the lower-end one,
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.180]   even does the metadata capture.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.180]   So it'll go out and scan like IMDB
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.020]   and grab all of the stuff and tag it for you.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:17.860]   >> I like that.
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:18.680]   That's pretty cool.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.520]   >> That's really convenient.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.020]   And so if that's enough, then go with the $3.99.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.140]   But if you want the extra, go with the $9.99.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.900]   Like $10, just cut out two lattes and you're done.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.140]   (laughing)
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:29.980]   Like, come on.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   >> And dinner.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.620]   >> Right, it's a software tool.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.460]   Come on.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.060]   >> This guy's hard at work.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:35.900]   He deserves that.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.540]   >> I agree, spend the money.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.980]   My pick is from a company called Reinvented Software.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.780]   I've been using them for a while for their feeder program,
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.580]   which is what we use to create our RSS feeds.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.660]   It's a great, you know, Reinvented Software.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.980]   They do a program, we used to call it,
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.460]   be called Keep It Together.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.380]   I think Andy might have mentioned this in the past.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.700]   I was doing research on the web a little while ago,
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.860]   like last week.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.060]   'Cause, you know, I had this fantasy
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:03.860]   that I was going to buy a boat.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.460]   And so I, where did that come from?
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.300]   >> How could you do?
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.020]   >> The question is, can you do shows off a boat?
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.540]   >> That was the question.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.100]   And so I wanted a way to--
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:12.940]   >> Tax write off, right?
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.940]   Well, I just wanted to be able to say,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.340]   I'm on a boat.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.500]   But I wanted to collate this information.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.420]   It's a variety of things, including PDF magazines,
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.820]   websites, files from all over,
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:30.740]   into some sort of way document that I could use to,
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.620]   you know, store it, refer to it,
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.540]   search it and everything.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.380]   And I've used in the past Devynth Think,
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.740]   which is a fairly high end,
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.620]   and a good solution for this.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.460]   But I never liked the UI for Devynth Think.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.980]   I found this from Reinvented.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.220]   There really no Mac software.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.900]   It's called Together Now.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.500]   It used to be called Keep It Together.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:48.340]   The only thing missing,
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.340]   and I really wish that they had an iPhone,
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.740]   or I think they're going to do an iPad version of this.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.260]   $40 in the App Store.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.140]   And it is basically a way to collate
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.060]   all your research and information.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.780]   You can encrypt it, you can store it in a Dropbox,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.420]   which I do, which means that it's available to me
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.380]   on all of my devices via Dropbox.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.340]   It will make PDF versions of everything,
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.380]   including web archives, bookmarks, and notes.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.500]   So you can read it in other,
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.900]   you know, you could use Good Reader, I guess,
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.980]   on the iPad until they come out with something.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.580]   But I just, I find it very nice for tagging,
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.700]   color coding, organizing, and searching through data.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.100]   I was able to create, you know,
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:35.100]   subfolders of blogs, retailers, web reviews, magazines,
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.860]   and so forth.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.100]   And they have a little,
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.420]   when you have it running in the background,
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:41.700]   they have a little tab on the side of the screen
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.940]   that you could just drag stuff to
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.500]   to make it very quick to drag stuff,
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.420]   or web pages, and so forth over into it.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.940]   So it is really kind of a research tool
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:49.820]   that I really like.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.780]   I looked at Scribner and a lot of other programs
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.620]   that let you do some of these similar things.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.860]   This seemed perfect for me.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.780]   It does sync with Mobile Me, 80s, and this is nice.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.380]   Completely Apple Scriptable.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.260]   So I always look for that in an application
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.180]   on the Mac platform.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.340]   Together from reinvented software.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.180]   >> It looks great.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.020]   >> Yeah, it's very slick.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:08.860]   >> Really run on iPad.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.900]   >> You know, I think I'm told that there,
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.380]   I believe working on an iPad version.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.220]   You're exactly right.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.500]   You really need it on an iPad.
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:16.820]   It is, it is.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.140]   >> I do so much of my research on my iPhone or my iPad.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.060]   >> Yeah.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.980]   Wouldn't it be nice if you could just kind of boom,
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:22.820]   and save it in there,
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   and then you'd have it on your desktop.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:24.660]   >> Exactly.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.500]   >> Exactly.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.820]   Like these other guys,
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.020]   and it really bothers me, they've forked it.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.980]   So there's a Mac App Store version,
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.820]   and there's a version you get from the website,
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.580]   and you buy one or the other.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.220]   >> This was your big concern, right?
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.860]   >> Yeah, it's exactly what I was worried about,
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.220]   and they've done the same thing.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.300]   The advantage to buy it on the App Store
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.060]   is updates, multiple machines.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.100]   I mean, I really like that.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.260]   Unfortunately,
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:54.380]   the App Store version is missing
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.580]   the ability to print PDFs to, to together.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:00.020]   So it adds that print to PDF function.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.420]   It adds a together item to it,
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.580]   and that just bugs the hell out of it.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.900]   >> So they take features out of the one in the Mac App Store?
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.220]   >> Well, they're getting 30% less.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   Maybe that's the rationale.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.060]   I don't know.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:13.900]   I wish people,
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.620]   this is my fear that the App Store would do this.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.620]   It is in fact doing it,
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.100]   and if IVI does the same thing,
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:21.260]   they've got a, I don't know if it's feature identical,
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.620]   or if it's forked.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.780]   The program I talked about last week, Alfred.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:28.060]   Because there's no in-app purchasing,
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.340]   they can't sell the full Alfred on the App Store,
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.100]   because they want to have an in-app purchase
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.900]   that allows you to add more features.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.180]   I just, I feel like this is going to happen
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.020]   a lot of different.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.100]   >> I think it's a transition, because I hope so.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.300]   >> Because I have to admit that I'm not,
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.020]   I mean, there's going to be a point where I stop
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.300]   buying apps that aren't in the App Store,
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.620]   because I just don't want to deal with it.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:46.460]   >> Well, exactly.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.300]   >> I don't want to deal with all the reinstallers.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.300]   >> Exactly.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.420]   So I bought the App App version,
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.900]   and the end of Forego to feature.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:26:01.140]   Producer IVI says they sell it outside the App Store,
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.420]   because they can update it faster.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.820]   Of course, you have to wait for Apple to allow an update.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.660]   And so if they want to update and fix,
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.140]   they're going to do it on the website faster.
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:14.260]   And you can't do DVD ripping on the IVI version
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.500]   in the App Store for obvious reasons.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.980]   >> For the App Store version, right.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:19.660]   Which I think is why the Pro version's only on his website.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.620]   >> That's why I'm going to the website to buy that one.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620]   >> Right.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.420]   Hey everybody, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.100]   Hey, it's really great to meet you, Andy.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.900]   Andy Beach is the guru of compression,
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:34.140]   and obviously a Mac break listener.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:34.980]   >> Hard and fan.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:36.580]   >> So we really appreciate your coming by
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.620]   and helping us out on the show.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.620]   >> I'm only sorry I didn't have stick on sideburns,
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:43.180]   so that you'll fully take over all of the indie skills.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.900]   We also can't sing in Russian, so.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:50.180]   >> Well, you had some much needed real world experience,
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.540]   shall we say.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.860]   So thank you, Andy Beach, for stopping by.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.180]   And again, see well as seewellnetworks.com.
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.540]   Now, it's Lindsay who's with the Pixelcore.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.420]   Boy, this is the place for the Pixelcore, if you're interested.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.860]   If this kind of stuff sends you, go to pixelcore.com,
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.420]   become a Pixelcore member.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.780]   And if you want to watch their streams,
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:09.340]   they're streaming live, when we're not, you are,
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:14.580]   from pixelcore.com/live, you're going to do a party tonight?
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:15.420]   >> We are.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.260]   >> What you doing tonight?
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.700]   >> We are going to do a little bit of streaming
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.380]   around the event, the big event.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.700]   But we're not going to be out streaming the final.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.540]   >> The final cut user group meeting is tonight.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.380]   >> Four after, but not.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.100]   >> After we'll probably make a big announcement,
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.340]   but if there is one, we'll be talking.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.140]   >> Pixelcore.com/live right after.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.660]   I'm sure there'll be a lot to say.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:34.060]   >> And unless they end the day, everybody in the room.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.820]   >> And today, later this afternoon,
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:39.780]   we'll be posting on Twitter, but around two o'clock,
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.300]   we're going to do a walkthrough of cameras
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.300]   with Darren Ocato.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.140]   >> Who was on, guess what?
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:43.980]   >> Oh, I like Darren, yeah.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.260]   >> He used to be the president of the ASC, Academy.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.940]   >> Yeah, so this is the, he's in the Academy's
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.940]   Research Council on Cameras and so on.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.780]   >> Wow.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.660]   >> Research, you know, so this is like,
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.140]   we're really going to talk cameras.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:58.980]   This is going to be a geeky walkabout.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   >> Oh, I want to follow that one.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.820]   >> Yeah, two o'clock.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:01.660]   >> Two o'clock.
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.580]   >> So we'll, we'll, the F3 will obviously be
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.420]   a big subject to the Spanish.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.140]   >> We're talking about F3s and Sonys and Reds and all kinds
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.060]   of things. >> Oh, okay, yeah.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.380]   >> It's going to be a super geeky.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:12.340]   >> Did, did Oakley make any announcements at the,
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.180]   at the Red?
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.020]   >> Red, yeah.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.540]   >> They're showing the epic.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.460]   >> They're showing the epic.
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.300]   >> Yeah, they're showing the epic.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.820]   The epic is starting to ship, you know, in pieces and,
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.340]   and I believe we're working on getting,
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.180]   we're going to get an epic up here.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.020]   >> Really?
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.860]   >> Yeah, so we're going to get an epic up.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.700]   >> What would that be?
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.020]   >> I think it, I think it's tomorrow.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.020]   >> Tomorrow?
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:30.020]   >> Oh boy, that'll be fun.
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:33.340]   >> Yeah, I was a, so Mike Seymour from FXPhD
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.100]   has an epic here, has a handheld epic and he's going to,
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.380]   he, it was not in the original list.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.220]   >> Is this 4K?
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.220]   >> Is this a 4K camera?
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.220]   >> This is the board, this is 5K.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.060]   >> 5K.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:45.460]   >> I gave it to, I think I, I handed him off to Lynn.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:50.620]   And so, so anyway, okay, we'll figure it out,
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:52.340]   but we're going to get, today was not the day.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:53.740]   Tomorrow's the day he can, he's available.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.180]   And so we're going to get Mike up here to show off
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.100]   the epic and talk about it.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.700]   And he's really the guy.
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:00.140]   Mike is the guy to talk about the, about the epic.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.140]   >> That'll be fun.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.660]   So right after we go off the air,
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:04.300]   we're going to do mostly photoing just a bit,
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:09.060]   go to pixelcore.com/live and watch Alex live.
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.860]   As relaxed as we are,
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.540]   your stuff's even more relaxed.
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.660]   Which I love.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:16.500]   It's just like walking around with Alex on the show floor.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.660]   >> We thought that, you know, we, we, we do other things.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.220]   We're going to be shooting a lot of like pre-produced episodes
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.060]   and so on and so forth.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.300]   But what we found is me and Brent walking around
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.060]   talking about stuff, like two guys that are really
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.340]   in the production chatting, it's stuff that--
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.180]   >> That's what I want.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.340]   >> Really, really enjoyed watching.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.180]   >> That's what I want.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.980]   >> The experience of the, of the experts.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:33.820]   >> Yeah.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.380]   We thank you all for joining us on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.980]   The NAB version.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.660]   We'll be back in studio next week with Andy and
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.740]   Aco Alex Lindsey and the gang.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.140]   And meanwhile, back to work.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.420]   Break time's over.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.160]   (upbeat music)
