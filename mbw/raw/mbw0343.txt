[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And I say that because Renee Richie found his way here from Montreal.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And I used Apple Maps to do it, sir.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Are we on Apple Maps?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Go to door. Yes. Wow. My location was on the right.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Your location. Nice lady. Is it the Siri voice?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yes, it is. The nuanced Siri lady.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Yeah. Your location is on the right. You have arrived. I'd show you a picture, but we're not Google dammit.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Well, good. I'm glad you made it. Nice to have you for my more.com. Good time for you to be here.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The rumors are flying fast and furious also with us. Andy Inaco, tech columnist at the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Hello. Hello. No hat.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh, no, I left my head upstairs.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You know, I have that happen to me once I get wired in to my seat.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It's such a major effort to leave that I just don't go anywhere.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   No, actually, it was more because of like this. I don't Thursday, Tuesday morning.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So usually so busy that this might be one of the two or three times a week.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I don't actually like wash my hair. Oh, I did actually wash my hair this morning.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And so okay. You wanted to you want your free flag to fly. This is unfortunate.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   This is unfortunately as good as my hair actually. You're getting as gray as I am, Andrew.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Okay. I started growing that beer and I gave up, you know, but I did note that I would have had mutton chops like that
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   that actually might have been a little less gray than yours. Yours are very gray.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Where's that blonde? No, no, they're great. Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But he's a young man. He's still a young young young young ish.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Thank you, but bless your heart. And you know, it's good to have here. That's the thing of any kind.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And also with us from Seville. No Valencia. Valencia.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Valencia Spain, Mike Elgin. Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   They actually have a lot of oranges here. Look, it says Peloponnese Greece. We got to fix that.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You're so very pathetic. We just say, "Hara, I love that."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "Hara, I love that." "Kama, the world." Okay, it's still in Greece.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You wish you were back in Greece? No, not really. Well, actually with the weather that we've been having here in Spain recently, yes, but
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   no, actually Valencia turns out to be an incredibly cool city.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I bet. I'm really enjoying it. It's where the oranges come from.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Where the oranges, and I also was at Las Fias last week. And that is something for the bucket list, I tell you.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   What is it? Are you familiar with this festival? No. It's nuts. What they do, and this whole tradition predates Christianity.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Something like 350 neighborhoods have a big contest to build these gigantic elaborate cartoonish wooden and paper mache statues.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh, I saw your pictures of the burning of the statues on Google+. So that was Las Fias.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's right. They have a party that goes all night, every night, for five nights. And then on the end of the fifth night, they torch these things.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This is in a big city, 20, 30 feet from major buildings, and they have a massive barn fire.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   See, Burning Man didn't invent this. No. No.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's a chest crate, and the whole week, kids are running around throwing dangerous firecrackers at tourists and stuff.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's really, really crazy. And of course everybody's hammered, so nobody cares.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But it's really, really crazy, and everybody should do it at least once in their lifetime.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   These nine knots cost as much as $75,000 to make. I mean, they're not burning these lightly.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   This reminds me a little bit of a Mardi Gras celebration.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It's kind of like that, except it's very unique in that the revelers don't, there's no costumes per se, other than a lot of people wear traditional Spanish costumes.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And then they do these parades. And I kid you not, there was a parade that I saw that was something like eight hours of people in traditional Spanish costumes wandering by.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Oh, I want to go to this. Again, I mean, it's really crazy. And the main thing that people do is drink massive amounts of alcohol and eat enormous amounts of food.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's the main thing all people do in the world. It doesn't mean less fire for that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   F-A-L-L-A-S, it's a Valencian for the fires.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Well, what they do is they mandate that certain food things, they have churros and they have the special churro-like...
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You know, Devorak was determined to say that churros did not exist in Spain, that there was some sort of American thing.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Every corner of every block during Las Vias had churros standing there. Mandated, stay open 24 hours a day for the entire festival.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So you'd be at the six o'clock in the morning coming home, and people are lining up for churros.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Oh, I would line up at 8 o'clock. The nine outs remain in place until March 19th in the day known as La crema, the burning.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Starting in the early evening, young men with axes chop cleverly hidden holes in the statues and stuff them with fireworks.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The crowds start to chant, the streetlights have turned off, and all the nine outs are set on fire at exactly midnight.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Over the years, the local bamberos, firemen have devised unique ways to protect the town's buildings from being accidentally set on fire,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   such as covering the fronts with fireproof tarps. Each year, one of the nine outs is spared from destruction by popular vote.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   This is called the Nine outs, the pardoned puppet.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Sounds like Thanksgiving.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And is exhibited in the local museum of the Nine outs, along with other favorites.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So this looks pretty big, right? But this is a children's one. Every one of these statues, there's a giant one for the adults and a little one for the children.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   This is one of the little ones, and it's about 15 feet high, something like that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Wow.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   The big one is like two stories high. Is this why you find yourself in Valencia? Did you go specifically for that?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah, we intended to knock around in Spain for three months, starting with the Mobile World Congress, and then we're going to go around.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Somebody told us that we really have to go to Las Fias, and so we came here for a month, and Las Fias was just incredible.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Good news. In June, in Alicante, the Ogaras, the San Juan, the bonfires of St. John.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Apparently, this is a popular thing in Spain to like things.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Burn your way across Spain. You can burn your way across Spain.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Nation of pyros. Wow. I am so jealous. It sounds wonderful. This sounds like something to put on your bucket list, as you said.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Definitely.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Wow. Well, there's our little travel law.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Certainly, like the economy around. Because if you're burning things down, that will sort of like spurt the construction trades raw materials later.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Look how close the buildings it is. I can't believe they don't have massive fires.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's unbelievable. You would never see anything.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   When we went to the very last one, the second, the runner up, they spare the best one, the second best one.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   They burned last, half an hour after all the others, and they burned this gigantic one completely in this claustrophobic position near all these buildings.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   When it was done burning, flaming shrapnel came raining down on the entire city, including all the million or so people that were there.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Holy moly.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I'm from Southern California, where a cigarette will set the whole state.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Look at that. It was really crazy. This is one of the regular burnings.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You note that I see the building behind it. That's not an illusion. That building is right there.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It's a less litigious society.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's what I love. A little danger never heard anyone.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   State burnout lawyers.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That's not true.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Mike, the one or 2.2 million people follow you on Google+, what amazing images. What did you take that with?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Cannon US 70.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Oh, beautiful image.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Fire is hard to shoot.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Especially, and when I was taking those pictures, what happened was we were, you know,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   probably 20 or 30 people back from the front row.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   The heat got so bad that people started panicking and pushing back.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   There was this semi-stampive situation of people freaking out from the heat.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It was awesome.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I had one of those monopods, the eye stabilizer monopod.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I was over the crowd. That worked out pretty well.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   My iPhone.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It was so nice to see you didn't get consumed in flame.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   This is a jam-packed Newsweek.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   There is so much to talk about.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I don't know where to begin.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   We could start with Adobe's CTO Kevin Lynch going to Apple, which happened right after the show last week,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   and then we'll work our way through the week.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   A lot of people said, "Whoa, why? This is the guy who did so much to promote a flash for so long."
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But we had Kevin Marks on this week in Google last week.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Kevin said, "No, no. This is the guy you want.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   He's the guy who promoted after flash, started promoting SVG and the use of HTML5 standards."
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   This is a guy who actually is the right guy.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Isn't it weird that people are jumping on low from him because,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   "My God, while he was a senior executive employee of Adobe,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   he promoted the product that he was responsible for promoting."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "Oh, my God. He is tainted with the sign of the beast for having done so."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   John Gruber said, "He is a bozo and a bad hire based on three years ago writing that flash was good."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   That's stupid.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I'm sorry, I read that this morning and I'd rather disagree with it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Or at least let's balance that with when Steve Jobs wrote his famous letter saying,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "Here's why we don't support flash. He made a number of points, most of which prove to be not technically true."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Once the first generation of real flash-enabled tablets came by,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   it turned out that no, they don't run hot. No, the battery life is roughly what I was experiencing
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   with the HTML5 video playback.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It wasn't any less stable than it was before.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   There are a lot of reasons why flash wasn't a great idea for mobile,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   but it's like, let's at least balance it up by saying there was a lot of snake oil being sold on both sides of that argument.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Renee, you wrote that next day, swinging for the stars on Apple's hiring of Kevin Lynch.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   You think it's a good move?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I looked at a group, a groupist's point wasn't that he supported, that Kevin Lynch supported flash while at Adobe,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   but his point was that while CTO, Chief Technology Officer of Adobe, Kevin Lynch didn't seem to have either the foresight or the power
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   to move Adobe into a more sensible, mobile direction.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   He kind of...
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Except that they did.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Well, they were like IE6 in that they were so far ahead of the market that they squandered the technology
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and they let everyone else catch up with them and they kind of left it.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   That might be true.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And Matt and Reese had a good point where he said it's hard to tell if Kevin Lynch is the wrong guy or he was just in the wrong job.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And I tried to look at it from an Apple point of view because Apple has some famously successful external hires like Tim Cook,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   who came from Compaq and Phil Schiller, who came from Macromedia, which is where Kevin Lynch got his start.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   They also had some really bad ones like John Broward recently, who everyone saw him coming from Dixon and said,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   "Ee, that's not the best."
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   But the low-end budget British retailer that he was running, Apple retail didn't last.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Didn't last at all.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Mark Papermaster, they hired him from IBM, IBM sued.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   They fought to keep him and then less than a year later, it's like, "See ya, Mark."
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So, but the idea is that originally it said that he was going to report to Bob Mansfield, which is odd because Kevin Lynch is a software guy.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Bob Mansfield does the radios and the processors.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He does core-level technology.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And then there's another report, I think John Pachowski from All Things D said that he's going to interface between the software
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and the hardware teams to improve communications.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   That would be a bad thing to have.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So, we talked previously about Apple having a hard time finding engineers, but finding sea-level talent at Apple,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   finding vice president talent that they're not promoting from within, but getting fresh eyes, fresh hands, fresh looks at technology,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   that's really hard.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And if there's even a chance that Lynch can do that job, it's worthwhile for Apple to take a swing at it.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Because that's how you find stars.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   You get people, you empower them, and you see what they can do.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So, this is an audacious move.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Yes.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Potentially flawed, but you don't know until you try it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Who knows where the next Tim Cooker Phil Schiller is going to come from?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   If you think about Phil Schiller, work for Macromedia.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   That was not the most-
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   That was a more friendly flash.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So, yeah.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   There's also an illusion among some of the sort of bloggers and also among the public that these little battles that,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   these little battles that companies in the industry have are that they take them seriously and actually believe,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   that this person's a bad person and I hate this person.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And that's really not the case at all.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It's a virtue to promote your own product and to the extent that he was unable to make things happen at a different company that was in line with the philosophy of yet another company is really not anything against him.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   If you look at his whole career, he's been intimately involved with Apple and Apple products for a long, long time.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And, you know, these people in the industry don't take these rivalries personally at all.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   You're just looking for good people.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Only bloggers do.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And he took creative suite to the Creative Cloud, which might be really important for Apple at some point.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   They got to find some better cloud people, that's for sure.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And he was also working for General Magic for Well and UI, wasn't he?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yes.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That's a nice pedigree.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That was a nice device and lots of mach connections in Apple.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Bill Atkinson worked there right, or was it Andy Hertzfeld?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Andy Hertzfeld worked.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   So he's no stranger to that crowd.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Okay.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   All right.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   We'll just wait.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It's another one of those inside baseball things where, oh goodness gracious, are we going to?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Who's the first person who's going to create a TMZ.com?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   For Apple.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Go for it.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I think we have several.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I'm not sure if I would pay any money for the first Phil Schiller upscirt shot.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   If he wants to get out of a limo, I'm not looking.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But I think because Tim Cook is still a new CEO, people are looking at his hiring decisions,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   especially post-brow it.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And it's a factor that people weigh with the stock and it's a factor that they weigh in covering
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Tim Cook as full-on CEO of Apple.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   All right.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   That's the first story.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Maybe I should have started with the other story, but it's been fixed.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So I guess it's less of a story, which was Apple has added two-factor authentication to your
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Apple ID.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Turn it on.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's not very onerous.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I have to say, I turn it on and I didn't find it a real problem.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   But briefly, and maybe not so briefly.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   We don't know.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But the Verge discovered a very bad hole in Apple's I Forgot page that allowed people who just
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   knew two things, your email address and your birthday, to steal your iCloud account.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It was our security writer, Nick Arnott.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   He saw the story and without being able to find or know the steps, he managed to
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   reduce it his own in 15 minutes.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Because it was a URL, right?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   It was a crafted URL.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   A crafted URL that I presume handed Apple the birthday and the email in Apple.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   You had to sniff the packet to get the format of the URL.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.560]   But in other words, even the information the Verge gave out, which was not how to do it,
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.280]   but was sufficient for somebody who was a sophisticated to figure it out.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.400]   And then Apple put it into maintenance mode, but he was able to craft a second URL that
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.240]   went past the maintenance mode.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.760]   He alerted Apple, they fixed that.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.040]   They took that part down.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.400]   And then he went through and basically explained the attack, but it really was just a case
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.960]   of them not security.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.440]   So filling out the two security questions, you could just take the URL that would be
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.800]   generated from a successful answer to that, change the ID, stick that in, send it back
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.440]   to them and you were in.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   And it's one of those things that, you know that it's trouble when I look at this breakdown
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   of how the people got in and thought, that's something that I would have thought of.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   That's bad.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.040]   Gee, I would have thought of that.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.840]   Now if you turn, if you were able to turn on second factor authentication, all that goes
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.400]   away, you don't even have security questions anymore, which is a good thing.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.720]   And it's probably good I did a lie about your birthday.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.680]   Make up a fictitious birthday and stick with it that you use for some of these services
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   just to get around.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.120]   Well, you know, I was just logging in to see if you, before the show, to see if BioShock
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.640]   had a Mac version and of course it asks you your birthday.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.360]   You do that all any game site you visit, they ask you for your birthday.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.440]   Now you could just lie, but it's easier just to go my birthday, $1,129.56 and then now they
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   have it.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.440]   Now everybody has it, Google has it, Facebook has it.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   It's a deal.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.680]   In Quebec, like elsewhere, they ask you your mother's maiden name as a security question.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   Another bad one.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.760]   But in Quebec, you don't change your name when you marry.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.960]   The government always calls you by your maiden name so everybody knows everybody's mother's
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.480]   maiden name and yet they still use it as a security question.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   That's really good.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.760]   And this is a similar thing because your birthday is almost everywhere now and it still asks
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.560]   the security question.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.520]   It's really horrible when you realize exactly how much data is being harvested that they
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.080]   don't need for the purpose that they're asking you for.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.240]   Like when they ask for a zip code, it really is to make sure they fix your location when
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.400]   they're asking for a birthday.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.720]   Yes, possibly it's because they're trying to satisfy age-restricted requirements so
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.560]   that they vary from state to state to state on access to content.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.880]   But they also want that information about what your demographic is about.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.000]   There was, I was just configuring a new piece of equipment two days ago and big and like
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.400]   page three of like a page seven, like as you walk through setting up the services, oh,
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.960]   we need your credit card information that will no, I'm going to leave those fields blank.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.640]   I'll push the big orange button that says next is I'm sorry, all these fields are required.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   And as I'm about to like get myself right, just know you have no need.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.040]   You don't have, you don't need my credit card information for what I'm about to ask
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   you to do.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.440]   Then after I'm about going to get my temper down about 10 notches, okay, this is tiny,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.960]   tiny little piece of HTML text in white gray on the white background that says no thanks.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.200]   That I can click to actually get rid of it.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.120]   Just hoping that people are not going to think about providing that kind of information,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.360]   including your address, including your phone number when you actually don't have to do
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   so.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   So that's why, I mean, it's phishing comes in all forms and sizes now and sometimes it's
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.600]   not just the Russian mob is trying to get your bank information.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.400]   It's these regular commercial websites is trying to add more data than they actually
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   need for it.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.440]   It's important to point out there asking the chat room, two factor authentication from
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.720]   Apple is only available in four countries, I think right now, the US, it's not available
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   in Canada.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   So what do you do?
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   You change your birth date.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.560]   And so that sounds like a silly answer.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560]   But that's the answer.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.640]   Assuming that there's something like this still out there, I mean, they fix this one.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.880]   Although it's interesting because Nick Arnott at I'm more came up with actually a different
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.120]   way than the original.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.000]   So he reverse engineered something that was another way.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.600]   It was an insecure procedure and they were multiple ways to attack the insecurity of that
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   procedure.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600]   Wow.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's a cross site forging vulnerability or CSRF.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   Wow.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.320]   It's just a point of starting.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.760]   I had an interesting experience with that two factor authentication for Google services.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.280]   The last day of Las Vegas when they were burning everything, which we were warned is
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.760]   pickpocket paradise.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.520]   Somebody lifted my iPhone.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.840]   I handed it to my wife.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.040]   She dropped in at her purse and then by the time the entire city had been burned to the
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.520]   ground, it was gone.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.600]   And so I had this is a few days, a couple days, two or three days before Apple announced
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   the two factor authentication, but I had Google's going.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.960]   But I had it set up on the phone.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   It was on the phone.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   Yes.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   So there's a process when you set up two factor authentication with Google where you have
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.320]   these secret codes and you're supposed to print it out and put it in your, this is the
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   whole thing.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.240]   But that's not foolproof either because I just had it and turning it off, changing all
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.720]   my passwords and then coming back later and setting it up with a different way for them
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.440]   to reach me to confirm the secret codes.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   But there's just, there's no substitute for changing your heart date, making sure you
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.360]   chain your phone to your physical body, you know, their two factor authentication isn't
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.840]   the ultimate solution either, unfortunately.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   And as I do, I do like the way that Apple set it up though.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.520]   It, as soon as I heard two factor authentication, I thought dang, does it mean that every time
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.760]   that I want to make a purchase, I have to make sure that I have my iOS device with me,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.400]   even though I'm not making that purchase on this for this device specifically, they only
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.720]   ask for it at times when you're about to crack open your security in a major way, like approve
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.520]   a new, a new device or approve a new payment method or make changes to your personal information.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.400]   So yeah, it doesn't bother you a lot.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.680]   In fact, I thought I would see it on the iTunes store on my iPad and I never did.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.920]   And the nice thing about it too is it'll send an SMS portal send to find my iPhone request,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.040]   which means that if you don't have an iOS device, but you have another phone, you can
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   still get the SMS version of it.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   Right.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   Is limited cross platform support.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.800]   And I guess we should point out that Mike, it, even if they have your Google authenticator
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.880]   on your phone, they still need your password.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:46.120]   And I guess if you have that on the phone in some form, you could be a good person.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.040]   There's a, there's another funny part of the story.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.240]   It's funny now was horrible at the time.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.760]   But what happened was this all happened at like three o'clock in the morning and we've
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.360]   been drinking gallons of sangria and just, I mean, it was just, you know, watching incredibly
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.040]   loud fireworks at the same time, these huge bomb fires are going on.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.560]   So sensory overload, I was like in this really weird state of mind.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.200]   And so I have a, the type of a case that has a wallet inside.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   So all my credit cards were gone too.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.600]   And so they probably threw away the phone and took the credit cards.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.200]   Well, no, I think they, I think they, well, I don't know what they did with the credit
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.120]   cards, but I think they just wanted the phone because several things.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.080]   We went to a Starbucks, which was the only thing open with Wi-Fi that we could find.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:37.680]   And I used another iPhone, an older iPhone that I have through the Wi-Fi to call the
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.560]   credit card companies to cancel my credit cards.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.160]   And while I was doing that, talking to the guy, I was simultaneously using fine my iPhone
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.480]   and I wanted to wipe the iPhone.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.960]   And so I saw it in my iPhone, I wiped it and I, what the phone that I wiped was the one
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.840]   I was using to call.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.400]   And I looked at it and suddenly it was being wiped.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.200]   And then I looked at my list and every phone that I've ever had is still listed as a wipe
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.760]  able device on fine my iPhone.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.040]   I just saw the first one and wiped it, which was really dumb, but there was three or four
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.440]   of them and there was no differentiation between them.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.400]   So anyway, you really have to prepare for this stuff because stuff does happen and you
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.080]   have to have a really clear plan, which I did not do.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.520]   So, you know, I'm sort of learning this the hard way.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   Wow.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   What a bummer.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   I'm so sorry.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.160]   Yeah, it was no big totally worth it.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.240]   I would sacrifice an iPhone every year to go to Las Vegas.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   Can I say that you were drunk and near huge fires losing your phone was not the worst.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.160]   That's right.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.520]   My breath could have caught on fire.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.040]   Now, are you going to pop alone and run the bulls next?
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.120]   Is that your next feat of lead, you know, amazing macho machismo?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.920]   I doubt it.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   Having cheeseburger chasing me is not my idea of a good time, but I we don't know where
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   we're going to go.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.480]   Probably going to go to Northern Africa, take a couple of trips.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   That's fun.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.280]   Yeah, but we'll be back in the US in time for Google I/O.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:12.200]   So also, Apple pushed out 6.1.3 because if you had as I do on your iPhone, you know,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.160]   the password lock, easy to bypass that.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.840]   And this one has been bypassed now, too.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.040]   The new one is bypassed again?
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.880]   And you were here, they fixed it and bypassed and now it's bypassed again.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   I believe so.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.840]   So in other words, that fix.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.960]   The Samsung has had theirs bypassed.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   That's right.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.080]   It's non-trivial to provide access to emergency calling and photography and lockdown the
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   whole thing.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.560]   Ah, that's the problem, isn't it?
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.840]   And you can only get access to it with four camera and contacts because that's the stuff
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360]   that they have to leave open for.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   Right.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   So that's not so bad.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   It's not like they can get you up.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   It's not optimal, but it's...
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.600]   Yeah, it's not perfect.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:52.080]   People made an acquisition of a company called Wi-Fi Slam.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.800]   And apparently it's an indoor location company, although we now know what the Slam means.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.520]   The simultaneous location and mapping.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.240]   There you go.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.920]   I thought it was like a shot to the head.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   So Wi-Fi Slam...
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.320]   Can you give Renee a dollar right now for having remembered that?
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.920]   He knew it right off the top of his head.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   I read...
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   American dollar.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   I've been reading it all week and I still don't remember it.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.240]   I knew it before I would not have gotten all four.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.360]   So the problem is that GPS, of course, doesn't work indoors.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   Google, among...
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.040]   I would presume others, but Google for sure has convention hall mapping, airport mapping,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.520]   a lot of shopping mall mapping, that I presume they're using the Google Street View to do.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.560]   And then I would guess triangulation of Wi-Fi access points, right?
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.720]   Is this the same idea?
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.600]   As far as I understand it, it does use different Wi-Fi and different signal points.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.200]   And it tries to figure out what the resistance would be.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.840]   I mean, Matthew Panzino did a really good article at the next web that Leo's looking
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   at right now.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.240]   And it tries to adjust for the material composition, but it's not...
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.080]   Apple bought C3 technologies a little while ago.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.960]   They were the company that did the helicopter and airplane flying to map buildings.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   And with this company, you press a button, it shows your location on the phone, then
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.280]   you walk through hallways, and it uses your location to map the passage through the building.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.440]   So it's not sort of a magic solution.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.320]   It sounds to me more like something Apple would use to generate maps than a company that's
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.440]   already going to provide us with maps.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   But...
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.360]   Well, for one of the issues is, and you see this all the time in apartment buildings,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.680]   you can't tell what floor you're on.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   Because the meat...
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.960]   So if you're in a mall with four floors, you don't know where you are.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.520]   Civilian GPS is not allowed to be exact enough to tell you the difference in stories,
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.960]   much less local distance.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   But this system is doing so many clever things, like trying to figure...
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.000]   Not just GPS, not just Wi-Fi, but here is the accelerometer, here's the gyroscope.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.120]   Here's a point at which he is...
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.760]   He seems this person seems to be moving faster rather than slower.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.000]   They're doing dead reckoning?
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   That's called dead reckoning.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   They're doing that?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.320]   Well, not just that, but as things like...
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.240]   If someone is moving faster rather than slower, that is an indication that they're walking
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.520]   in a straight line, no matter what the other sensors are telling them.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.920]   Now I gotta point out that they're not just recording this for you, but in order for this
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.600]   to work, they have to record everybody who's in this building, they're in location as they
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.680]   guess it.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.080]   So what it's saying to me is that if I'm carrying around an iPhone, that it's constantly sending
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.360]   not just location information, but accelerometer information, angle information and other stuff
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   back, right?
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:31.200]   It really depends on how Apple chooses to implement this technology.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.760]   Remember this is all guesswork at this point.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.840]   We know the technology is, we don't know how to what extent Apple's gonna use it, but let's
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:44.240]   say we go for the alternate reality in which Apple is a bunch of greedy, non-privacy respecting
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   bastards.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   They could...
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.280]   A company that is more like Facebook than Apple, let's put it that way, could...
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.800]   If they had their phone, they could put this technology in and make sure that anytime there
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.880]   is somebody running their operating system in this building, it is collecting this information.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.760]   And essentially, every aunt that leaves a trail is giving more information about what
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.480]   those trails are.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.320]   And that one person running this software is not gonna give Facebook useful information,
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.680]   but a hundred people using this software without their knowledge every single day would give
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.600]   a very, very interesting profile of here is where all the paths are.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.960]   And then you hand that information off to a central server that can sort of transpose
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.080]   that into, okay, this is a hallway, this is a place where people move and then stop, so
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.000]   this must be a congregation area.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.320]   So it could be one of those places where crowdsourcing could produce a very, very consistent map of
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   something like...
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.280]   On the plus side, something like an amusement park, something like a shopping center or a
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   mall.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.080]   On the negative side, something like a business of 40 to 50 people or a school or something
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   like that.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:53.440]   So it would be a good thing if this is a simple way for people who want their public spaces
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.600]   to be mapped to create these very, very accurate maps.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:02.160]   Like assume that you have employees of a mall and that basically you give your security
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.960]   guards like each phone and just of course of walking through the mall every day for months,
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.320]   they produce accidentally a beautiful map with their knowledge.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.680]   That could be a very good thing.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.560]   If it turns out that without your knowledge, you're entering a building that the building
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.520]   that you go to work in every single day has been mapped down to a six inch resolution.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.400]   Now anybody can not only find out what, how to get from one point to another inside your
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.560]   building, but even a point where they can figure out that, okay, the accelerometer
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.240]   data from Andy's phone indicates he's probably on the third floor and probably in the northwest
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.760]   quadrant of the building.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.120]   He is typically in this office, so I bet he is in this office today on Tuesday.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.400]   But that's really what they're going to have to do to be not Facebook, which is completely
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.040]   be able to prove that they can decouple the data from the individual.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.120]   They can't, and I'll show you why they can't in a moment.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.440]   You know what they may have just, yeah, they may have hired these people because this is
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.720]   just brilliant stuff.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.760]   I mean, they're looking at things like if you've got, they measure footfalls, right,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.360]   because they can tell from the accelerometer, okay, that was a step.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.080]   But then they take all this data and they mash it together and they look for patterns
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.200]   and they're able from that in very, I think this very high end computer science.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.560]   I saw two years ago, I came across a paper from a graduate paper that tried to figure
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.720]   out where a coffee machine was inside a building based on what times do people stop at a certain
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.520]   location and how much time do they spend there.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.200]   And that's just an example of if you have a large enough data set and a clever enough
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.600]   mind looking at that data set, you can pop out all kinds of really interesting information.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:47.480]   And so whether this is an invasion of personal privacy or not, just like sometimes you really
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.400]   have to respect how good a hack is and how clever it is, this is some really smart technology
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   that you just have.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.600]   I wonder how much more of an invasion of privacy this is than what is pretty standard, which
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.360]   is that your phone is going around mapping where the Wi-Fi locations are.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:10.960]   And the reason that's something of a privacy issue is that the Wi-Fi nodes in question
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.880]   could be in your house inside people's house without their permission.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.440]   So it's not only the users' no permission, but it's the Wi-Fi.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.680]   But remember permission is not just sending the location, it's not just sending the Wi-Fi
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.480]   permission, it's sending every bit of data coming off of that phone, the accelerometer.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.560]   You do that for traffic on the road now.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:33.920]   Let me point you to this article in Nature that just came out from some university researchers
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.680]   who basically said after studying 15 months of human mobility data for one and a half
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.560]   million people that all they take really is four points and they can identify 95% of
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.760]   us who we are based on those four points of data.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.840]   So this massive amount of data is sufficient for people.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.520]   Now, you have to make the decision about whether it's worth it to you.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.520]   It's worth it to me.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.760]   I couldn't care less if somebody knows where I am.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.680]   But if you're in the Windows Protection Program, maybe you should care.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   And does Apple care?
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.080]   And certainly Apple cares.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.360]   I mean, they're collecting the data, it doesn't even matter if Apple cares.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.200]   If that data is lost, that stuff has huge value.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.040]   Remember that this is the same company that was crowdsourcing traffic information and
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.120]   leaving it as an open file that anybody could access.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.040]   But I'm sorry, Mike, you've been trying to talk.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   You're getting rid of it.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.560]   I just, no, I just, the problem with using this technology on a permission basis is nobody
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.200]   will grant that permission.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   There's no way to ask permission that doesn't sound horrible.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.400]   Oh, we're going to track everything on your phone.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.320]   This is a memo from corporate headquarters.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.960]   We want to map the inside of the building.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.560]   And so we'd like to map every step you take, every place, the angle of your phone, every
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.440]   time you're in the men's room, we're going to know when your phone is in there.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   Don't worry.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.760]   You know, your data will be protected.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   Nobody's going to agree to that.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.000]   So in order to use it, you'd have to--
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.640]   I'm kind of thinking about, remember that Kickstarter project of the stainless steel
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   really cool iPhone case that they shipped.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.560]   They didn't figure out that when you put a stainless steel band around the iPhone, you
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.720]   sort of hide the antenna from everybody.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.600]   I think that's going to be now a very, very popular item, the known as the privacy band,
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.320]   the chastity belt for your iPhone.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.720]   I would pay $80 to make sure that nobody can get access to any of the data inside my
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.400]   phone in any wireless network.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.560]   And let's point out that Apple recently updated its privacy policy to say it was going to
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:30.160]   share spatio-temporal location of their users with partners and licensees.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.080]   I don't know what spatio-temporal location means, but I think it means anything they
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   want.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.280]   I don't want to keep people up.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   This stuff goes on all the time.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.200]   Whenever you go to a store and you buy a can of Coke or you buy potato chips, they collect
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.480]   that information and it takes very little effort to build a profile of you as a shopper
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.960]   and very few unique identifiers and they do try to figure out what kind of coupons are
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.240]   the best value for them to give.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.360]   But they're still creating these profiles of us all the time in almost every industry
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   now.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.920]   And that's what's interesting about big data is.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.000]   The difference though is that if I really worry about that, I can simply not use the
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.360]   price club card when I make my purchase.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.800]   It's not like when I walk into a store as part of the license, as part of the deal that
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.240]   I'm making with the store of selling me this bottle of Diet Coke for $1.79, that I have
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.760]   to tell them who I am and what time of day I've made this purchase.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.480]   They don't need the card anymore though.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.360]   They have such a big volume set and they're doing it.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.400]   It's called customer insight analytics and market basket analysis.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.240]   They can usually figure out who you are based on buying patterns and sometimes it's tied
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.040]   to phone numbers, sometimes it's tied to other metrics, but we don't need the card
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   anymore.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.880]   I know love those systems and there are ways to opt out of this.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.680]   So as long as they'll meet, walking to a random gas station, they're going to identify me
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   if I pay cash.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.200]   There have been some interesting studies quoted in this article.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.320]   In one study, a medical database was successfully combined with a voters list to extract the
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   health record of the governor of Massachusetts.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.240]   So you could think of a lot of nefarious uses for this.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.760]   Let's say the Westboro Baptist Church actually got some intelligent people there and they
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.520]   decided that they wanted to watch a million people.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.480]   If anybody went near an abortion clinic, wipe their iPhone or do something.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.960]   All of this stuff is possible given the data.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.600]   And so the point really is the data is being collected.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.240]   It's pretty clear now.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.120]   Apple's got a very big horse in this race.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.800]   Google certainly has for a long time.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.400]   Databases are combined from a variety of sources can give you a very accurate profile of yourself.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.640]   It's very difficult to opt out.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.560]   I guess you could, but it's very difficult.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.960]   You can move to Valencia.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   It's very difficult to opt out.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.320]   And companies like Skyhook are doing it on small companies also are doing it.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   And there's benefit.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   There's certainly benefit to us for this.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.520]   So those are the data points.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.240]   I don't know what you make of that.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.720]   I think the biggest problem is that the human mind is not capable of projecting or predicting
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.320]   what big data and machine learning are capable of extracting.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.600]   Well, this is a surprise.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:07.200]   More location points is enough to identify a person, an individual, in 95% of the cases.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.280]   That's how unique where we go is.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.360]   And most people just aren't aware of this.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.960]   But holidays are kind of dangerous for me because I sometimes keep talking and I don't
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.920]   really, I'm not taking the temperature of what I'm saying is having a reaction on people
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.000]   in the room.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.360]   And so someone was at a table with like 12 or 13 people and someone was talking about,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.800]   oh, I don't really care if this company knows about this.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.440]   And as it was, as it happened, I was doing like a lot of research on that particular topic.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.480]   And I said, well, here is the amount of information that I can get off of you.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.960]   If I just know two of these random things, you know, you're not interested in protecting.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.320]   And I'm just talking, talking, talking.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.720]   And I see this person's face get a little wider and a little wider and a little wider
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.600]   because they just don't, they don't understand that this is an action.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:55.240]   It's, we're used to the idea that when you enter a casino that that environment is designed
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.520]   to make sure you stay there and keeps you keep losing money for as long as possible.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   If they can do that by depriving you of your sense of time, depriving you of your higher
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.760]   logic functions, they will play every trick to do that.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.200]   And what people need to understand is that data mining is such a lucrative business that
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.560]   it turns the world into a casino like that where anytime they can, they can get one piece
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.160]   of information out of you.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.680]   And anytime they can buy buying off some grad students thesis project and integrating this
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.800]   into another data set to figure out, to hook up one innocent little database with another
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   innocent little database, they're definitely going to do it.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.520]   And the concern is that the opt out button is being grayed out in more and more of our
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.760]   of our of our of our situations.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.440]   And even a company like Apple, I don't think is necessarily immune from this.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.840]   I'll I'll spin this down because once again, I'm pushing my mouth off a little bit.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   But I mean, we, we, I don't trust Facebook at all because their corporate policy is the
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.280]   world is there to be shared with everything.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.880]   So we're our, it's our job is to collect as much, much information as possible and share
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   it with as many people as possible.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.240]   Google is more trustworthy only because they want to increase profits for Google and not
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.800]   the entire world.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.720]   But they are still designed to target ads towards me personally.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.240]   That gives them a great incentive to identify me and my habits personally.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.120]   I trust Apple most of all, but not because I don't believe that they are never going
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.560]   to try to pull information about my life, but because they are going to make sure that
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.040]   that is only applied towards Apple products.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.920]   So I don't think that there is a halo around Apple's data collection policies.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.040]   I just simply believe that the amount of damage that they can do with the information they're
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.960]   collecting from me as an iPad user as an iPhone user or Mac user is not as great as it would
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   be on other devices.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.880]   The other problem though is that you mentioned, do I trust Google?
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.920]   Do I trust Apple?
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.880]   So you know, this is where Siri and Google now are going.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.040]   They're going in a direction of collecting maximum amounts of information.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.200]   All this stuff that we're talking about times a hundred.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.440]   Then there are all these startups and they're coming out with really like Grocker and easily
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   do.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.880]   Google's Field Trip is awesome.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   Mind meld.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   I don't know if you're familiar with Mind meld.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.480]   There's another one called Sherpa.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:03.640]   These startup, these little tiny companies are giving you these incredible benefits in
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.200]   exchange for tracking every single thing that you do and every single place that you
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.400]   go and everybody's going to love these apps.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.600]   And there's going to be a lot of them.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.480]   So this data is going to be flying in every direction and somebody's going to be selling
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   it.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.160]   It's really going to be an issue that somebody's going to have to deal with.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.160]   Or just give up.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.600]   I can only hear a lot of zero privacy.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.920]   Well, certainly for sure that if you carry a cell phone you've opted in.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   Period.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   So stop carrying a cell phone.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.920]   Credit cards, you've got to throw those away.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   You've got to use cash only.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   Anything can last too long.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   Anything with RFID on it.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.280]   Ask what you could do it, but you're going to be, you're going to be mightily inconvenienced.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   So I just gave up.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.160]   If I can assuage people's fears of before I worked at IMO or I spent 10 years in high-end
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.760]   analytic databases, like big-factor databases, a calendar decomposition the whole day.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   Just move over a little bit here.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.320]   And though, but the thing is that it was incredibly hard to sell because people just
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.800]   wanted to buy Oracle.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.720]   And it's going to take a generation of people to really get this technology to understand
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.400]   it because HP Bot Vertica did nothing with it.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.160]   There's all sorts of really amazing technologies that are squandered because these companies
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.480]   don't really understand them yet.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:19.040]   And that's going to be sensitive to this kind of backlash from consumers who say, you're
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.800]   collecting what about who?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   You know what?
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   I don't think that's good.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   So hugely lucrative business.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.520]   There are companies that all they do is collect data based on merchants and sell that data
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.000]   back to merchants and their competitors.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.920]   And that's going to be the next sort of Google AdSense massive ad marketing buys.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.040]   We're going to have to live with it, I think.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.920]   But certainly if you want to use technology, you're going to have to live with it.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.040]   And why Fife Slam is these guys are really smart.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.160]   I mean, just based on what I've read about them, they made a sample program oddly enough
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.760]   for Android, never released on the iPhone.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.560]   That's been pulled off the Android store.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.360]   But it showed what they could do with the data they have.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.720]   And I think this is a little scary and brilliant.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.240]   You can see why Apple wants them.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.640]   In fact, they may not do any of this stuff.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.240]   They may just want these guys.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.720]   As God said in the movie, there is no up without a down.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.400]   There is no inside without an outside.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.200]   There is no bad without a good.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   So they may just need a free spot.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   They may just need a free spot.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.160]   For their circular campus, how do you find anything on everything in the circle?
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.400]   It's based on NASCAR.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.640]   Just keep making left turns.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   You'll get there eventually.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.360]   And this is like the fourth, I think the fourth mapping company of the bought in recent
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.800]   years, they bought PlaySpace and Poly9 and C3 Technologies.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   So they needed to.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   We know that.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.600]   And what it shows is they're all in on stuff.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.000]   They're not going to sit back.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Major, you have interest.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   They really want this to work.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   More than a hobby.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   More than a hobby.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   They came late, but they came when they smelled the money.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.720]   They brought the bank.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.880]   Well, you know, there is an opportunity.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.320]   Okay, I'll say there is an opportunity for Apple here.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.840]   And you kind of framed that conversation right at the beginning, Andy, when you said,
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.720]   "If you trust Apple, what if a company could really earn your trust in terms of data privacy
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   but still offer you the benefits of it but say, "And Apple really, I think, is trying
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.040]   to position themselves this way.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.480]   Look, we're collecting this data, but we're not sharing it.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.960]   This is an opportunity for somebody to say, "We're going to be the privacy company, but
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.280]   we're still going to give you the benefits of all this data."
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.840]   Isn't that a great opportunity?
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.680]   It's always a transaction.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.200]   I mean, for everything that you can say negatively about Google, and there's a lot you can say
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.360]   about how they collect data, they are giving you wonderful free products that would probably
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.600]   cost the average consumer at least $1,200 a year if they had to pay for all this sort
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.320]   of stuff.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.560]   And there are a bunch of articles out there about, "Well, let's say you want to cut your
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:38.640]   access to Google and you want to really invest in privacy rather than in the full portfolio
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.560]   of features.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:44.080]   You can get mail systems that work on your own personal servers, that cost money.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.400]   You can run something similar to Google Reader and have that on a server that you control.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.600]   There are pay services that promise that whatever data that you generate and whatever
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.800]   social map you create on this social network belongs to you and can be accessed by nobody
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   else.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.640]   Unfortunately, the two costs are one money because these people need to be, if they're
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.400]   not going to be making money off of selling your data, they need to keep the lights on
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.760]   and maybe put some food into the bellies of their children.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.880]   But also, it's going to cost in terms of ease of use.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   There is a threshold that you could call like the, "I don't care anymore threshold,"
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:28.960]   where I would love to have a fresh barbecue roast chicken until I find out how complicated
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:34.560]   it is to produce a real commercial grade roast.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.040]   At which point, I thought, "Maybe I will go to Chipotle and give that nice man $6.35
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.160]   and he will hand me a burrito instead of my spending four hours in the kitchen."
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.320]   A lot of people care about privacy, but it quickly crosses their, "I don't care about
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   this anymore threshold."
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.260]   When you tell them, "Here's how much you have to learn about how networks work and
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.920]   how encryption works in order to really have security and privacy on the internet."
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:03.000]   There are also kids growing up and becoming teenagers in a world where privacy feels like
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.920]   it's completely gone already and they accept it very quickly.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.200]   Those of us who remember an era where we couldn't be tracked 24/7 are more sensitive to privacy
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.960]   issues than somebody who's 15 or 20 right now who just seems like a pointless concern.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   Absolutely.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.280]   Yeah, but wait a little, there's a picture of them telling jokes about dongles posted
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.080]   on the Twitter and they lose their jobs.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.880]   They might be a little more concerned about it all of a sudden.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.240]   But who are you going to hire because you're going to have that kind of date on everybody?
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.240]   Well, we have to.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.920]   Yeah, it's like for a while, if you'd smoked a pot that was a strike against you to be
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   president of the United States, not anymore, not so much anymore.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   Be pretty hard to find somebody who had at least inhaled.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.080]   And if the cocaine might be okay now, so it's like it's a great time to run for president
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   for all of us.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:58.800]   At the same time, maybe we would, real timers would try to explain to people who are like
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.000]   14 to 23 that you shouldn't be, you should care about this stuff.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.240]   It's amazing to us that you don't think that's dangerous.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:11.400]   But at the same time, those of us who grew up during the Cold War, like, didn't you,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.600]   you woke up every morning knowing that at any point nuclear bombs could rain down and
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.120]   destroy all of civilization and I can't believe you're being so blasey about it.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.200]   Well, I mean, we just, what are you going to do?
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   I can cover it.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   What are you going to do?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   It's part of life.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   Our president isn't idiot.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   What are you going to do?
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.440]   I'm not really up for our insurrection.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.960]   I'd much rather deal with the risk of being bombed to death.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   Most of it exactly.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.160]   Most of us just kind of go along and get a longer get along.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.600]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:48.520]   Times, Renee Richie from imore.com, Mike Elgin from Valencia, Spain and Google Plus, where
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.000]   he is still the last man standing.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.840]   I like to tease him on that.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   I'm not really standing.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.520]   You know, they just released a new iOS update on Google Plus.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.120]   Again, better and better and better.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.760]   It's becoming like the iOS app that no one uses.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.160]   Now it's a beautiful thing.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:10.440]   And you know, there's a funny thing about Google Plus.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.840]   There's a very hardcore group of people in the US who love it.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.920]   This is a radically international service that the rest of the world is definitely
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.160]   on it.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:26.520]   And so it's just a different, it's kind of outside of the normal tech bubble where a
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.840]   lot of people in tech journalism are not into it.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.120]   But they're a minority globally.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   It's huge.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.280]   Huge huge.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   That's very interesting.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:43.000]   Yeah, or could never took off in the US, predated Facebook, but it was huge in Brazil,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.440]   not so much anymore in Facebook.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.280]   It was huge in Brazil and secondarily it was huge in India.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:53.640]   But the numbers, even for India and Brazil, are getting ginormous on Google Plus.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.080]   And there's another thing that happened.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   Why is that, Mike?
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.240]   Do you think they trust Google more than Facebook?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:04.520]   Well, actually I read something recently that was very interesting, which is that Facebook
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.640]   and Google both have these subsidized cell phone services in a lot of the third world,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.440]   where they will basically reduce the cost of the data plan, but you get this kind of
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.800]   AOL of just Facebook or just Google services.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.920]   And so a lot of people around the world, when they, when they, their only computer is
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.520]   a phone, is a smartphone.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.000]   It's their first smartphone.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.360]   They're often upgrading from a feature phone.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:37.800]   And to get the subsidized rate, they're getting just Google services, for example.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   That's one small reason.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.880]   I don't know what the impact is.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.480]   That is probably pretty insignificant.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:48.040]   But I do think that there's a lot of affinity, that there's a lot less affinity for every
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:54.200]   latest startup, every latest thing, which we have in Silicon Valley, and more affinity
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.680]   for like, oh, I know Google.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.120]   I've been using Google Search for a long time.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   I've been using Gmail for a long time.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   That's a brand that I trust.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.640]   So there's a different mentality and a less of a likelihood to jump on the latest thing.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.520]   Plus they get on it, and it's really, really nice, and they can, you know, they're finding
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   a lot.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.840]   Like, you know, I get on, and I have, if I mention something about Saudi Arabia, for
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.680]   example, which I often do, I just get flooded with all these people come out of the woodwork
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.040]   from Saudi Arabia, English-speaking Saudis.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.360]   And we have these wonderful debates, and then I'll mention another country and all those
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.360]   people come out of the woodwork.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.400]   It's very, very international.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.160]   And it doesn't hurt that there's a really great Chrome plugin that just instantly translates
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.040]   all the comments into whatever your language is.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.440]   And so people who don't even speak the same language are having these really rich conversations.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.200]   So it's an interesting phenomenon.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:49.320]   We certainly have had good results with the communities for almost all of our shows.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   Good engagement and stuff.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.720]   But we're not there to get everybody who watches or listens to shows involved.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.520]   We're just, if we can get a few thousand people who are engaged in participating, that's
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   a great platform for them.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   Going toward the viewers are.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   Right.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   Thank you for being here.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   We appreciate it.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   What time is it in Valencia?
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   Oh, it's not bad.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   It's 8.30.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.000]   Oh, it's early yet.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.400]   Plenty of time before they set the town on fire.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   That's right.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   I have time to run.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   That's right.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.280]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com LegalZoom.com LegalZoom.com.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.040]   Not a law firm.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.320]   They provide self-help legal services at your direction, which means you can use them to
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.960]   do personal and business legal documents.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.880]   You can trust.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.840]   If you need advice from an attorney, they even can help you with that, with pre-negotiated
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.000]   prices in their legal plan in most states.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.240]   You can see reviews of the attorney's profile so you know what you're getting.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.240]   I'll give you an example.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.760]   When we started to it, I wanted to make it an LLC.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.760]   I don't know why.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   I just got it in my mind.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.480]   I shouldn't start a business without some protection.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.880]   An LLC for a startup seemed like the simplest thing.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.520]   $99, a few questions, and boom.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:00.800]   We're still using those LLC papers, even though we now have a law firm.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.720]   Lots of lawyers in the cost, I could tell you, is a lot more than LegalZoom.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.080]   That LLC stands, and it's great.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.320]   Trademarks, copyrights, patents, NDAs, regular corporations too.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.480]   You could do it all at LegalZoom.com for a lot less.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.240]   Frankly, you know everything that you need to know.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.120]   If you don't, for instance, there was one question.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.520]   I mentioned this before I came up with was, "What state should I incorporate?"
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.560]   Some said Delaware, some said California.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.480]   I would have loved to have asked an attorney, "Well, what do you think?"
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.840]   Now with the LegalZoom, you can.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.640]   They've got that legal plan attorney, an extensive network in most states that can give
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.760]   you advice.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.040]   One question to at a very affordable price.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.480]   Twelve years, LegalZoom has been around.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.640]   Two million Americans have used them.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.960]   Not just for business too.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.120]   Will's just 69 bucks.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.440]   If you don't have a will, you better make one.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   Especially if you've got kids.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.000]   You don't want the government or courts to decide what happens to your kids.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.160]   You want to say before that day, you could establish a living trust at LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.320]   If you are a blogger, maybe you want to trademark your blog title.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.320]   Think about that.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.560]   I'm more as trademarked, I'm sure.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.560]   We've applied for sure.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   I don't know how far it is.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   Yeah, well, it takes a little while to get it, but you don't want to mess around with
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   that kind of stuff.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.880]   You don't want somebody coming along and saying, "Yeah, I'm I'm more."
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.880]   No, I'm I'm more.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.480]   Especially with all the different scraper sites, it's bad.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.280]   Simple thing to do, and it's not expensive.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.920]   NDAs, maybe you've invented something and you want to share it with a company, maybe
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.240]   they want to make it, but you might want to have an NDA to protect you.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   It's all there.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.840]   Again, not a law firm, but self-help services at your specific direction.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.240]   But you can speak to a legal plan attorney to get your questions answered and get ongoing
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.360]   advice for a special thank you for using LegalZoom.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.880]   Use our offer code MBW and we'll give you 10 bucks off your purchase at legalzoom.com.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.960]   Just a little, you know, just to encourage you to use MBW as the offer code so they know
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.160]   you saw it here.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   T-Mobile iPhone Leo.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:08.480]   Yeah, T-Mobile has announced that this morning they're going to have the iPhone come April
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.480]   for how much?
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   99 bucks, right?
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.760]   It is an incredibly complicated formula.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.360]   Oh, so it's not just, here's 99 bucks.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.360]   Give me my iPhone 5 because they're getting rid of the contracts.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.480]   Yeah, but you put down 99 bucks and then you pay $20 a month for two years.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   Oh.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.880]   And it's being the total price ends up being lower than the amount you paid to just get
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   an online phone.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.880]   So it's a really good deal.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.640]   And then your data and phone plan is separate from that, but not on a contract.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.560]   It actually seems like a really cool deal to me.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.200]   They're going to have the HTC One 2, which is something I've been very interested in.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.680]   And price.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   That's tempting.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.920]   And they're eliminating early termination fees or eliminating contracts or no.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.360]   So here's the big problem in the US market is that people are used to subsidized phones.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.840]   They're used to going into an AT&T or a Verizon and getting the $0 or $100 to a $100 phone.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.720]   And lots of people have tried to go to the contract free phone where you just pay outright
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.320]   and then pay your service.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   And it seems really expensive.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.520]   That's how Ting does it.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.640]   But yeah, then it's a $600 phone.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   So they're mitigating.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.560]   And the whole thing is that people are not-- you can walk in there and buy an unlocked phone
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.240]   and just pay your money for it and go about your business.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.280]   But they don't want to lose a customer who comes in and says, why is it so expensive?
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:25.120]   So they also have ways where you can pay part of the phone and then pre-pay more of it.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   It's an interesting middle ground.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.320]   It is more complicated than going to a pure contract free model.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.360]   But I think it's smart given the US market.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.800]   And there are-- you do have to pay fees if you try to terminate earlier and what else.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.960]   Which is more complicated than it has to be.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.160]   But I think that's the realities of their market.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   It's certainly fairer.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.240]   I mean, the AT&T's of the world, the standard contract thing, the whole business model is
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.920]   designed to bury and hide the details of what you're paying for and when.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.240]   So that they get more money.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:55:00.000]   For example, if you get a phone every single time after two years and you get the new
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.200]   phone subsidized right on schedule, then you can argue that you might be paying for that
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.160]   phone what it costs.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:14.200]   But if you delay three, four, five months, you're still paying for the phone even after
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.600]   you're paid for it.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.080]   Until you get another phone.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.440]   It's such a rip off and they just are harvesting cash from all these users because there's
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.280]   so much confusion built into a regular subsidized phone.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.560]   That's how a mortgage model works.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.520]   Like you end up paying more for your house on a mortgage than if you bought it up front.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.440]   It's called interest.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   It's called interest.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.440]   Yep.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   But it's marketed interest.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.240]   And you know what the annual percentage rate is.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   You know what you're paying.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.080]   You know what portion is principal, what portion is interest.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.240]   This is, I think you're right Mike.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.600]   I think clarity is really what we want.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.840]   Just tell me.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.320]   You know.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:51.000]   That's the devastating thing for the conventional carriers because they don't want anybody setting
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.800]   a precedent for clarity about what you're paying for.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.560]   That's a disaster for them.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:01.760]   They're doing this kind of economic, predictably irrational stuff where they go.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   But it's only.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   I always do this.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   It's a cheap phone.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   It's $50.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   It's $0.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   That's irrelevant.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.320]   The price up front is the smallest part of what you're going to pay over two years for
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.520]   the total cost of ownership.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.560]   It's the total cost of ownership that matters.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.720]   And $50 at the beginning less is not really saving you much money.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.520]   And the second part of this was their LTU announcement.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.160]   I think it's seven cities.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.840]   Not, you know, this is really the thing that holds people back from T-Mobile.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:29.840]   It's HSPA plus.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.720]   Although because nobody uses T-Mobile, I use it.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   It's not bad.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.720]   It's pretty fast.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.160]   Originally, they were AWS spectrum.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.200]   So not the same spectrum as AT&T and not all phones supported it.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.000]   But they've been rolling out more 3G HSPA on regular frequencies.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And it's sound.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.480]   And I don't know if they said whether the iPhone on T-Mobile will work on AWS or not.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   I missed.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   I don't know.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.240]   Baltimore, Houston, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Jose and Washington, DC will be
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.400]   the first LTE cities.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.920]   Now they're acquiring MetroPCS.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:11.400]   So that will add to more LTE on the AWS frequencies.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   What were you pointing at?
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.120]   Whether it says it's AWS for their regular iPhone, but it looks like it might be because
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.720]   that's their big thing is it has to be.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.960]   There's more, they have a lot more faster internet on HSPA on AWS than they have on standard
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   frequencies.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.400]   So is it a frequency issue?
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.400]   It's not a radio issue.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   It's just you have to have that frequency.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.520]   It's just Apple could enable it, but Apple could do a lot of things.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.680]   So it'll be interesting to see what the T-Mobile version of the iPhone can do.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Does Apple do?
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.600]   They do do different SKUs for different carriers, right?
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.840]   They have three SKUs right now.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   They have one.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.000]   There's a line of thinking that Verizon demands their own SKU.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.560]   So no matter what you do, if you make a world phone, you'll have to be able to pull.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:52.000]   The new version of the A1428 has been tweaked on the hardware side by Apple to support advanced
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.760]   wireless services on T-Mobile's network.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.000]   So they have three SKUs now and it sounds like that'll stay the same way.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   That's good news.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.040]   Will an iPhone 5 be actually better on T-Mobile with AWS?
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   I guess it depends on the area you live in, which is usually the biggest lighting factor
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   for carrier.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   And might be here.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:16.000]   Here's the other bit of good news that if I'm reading the news correctly, I believe
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.760]   that if you have a family plan, it's a good price.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.600]   You have five people on the plan.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.160]   It's like 210 bucks for everything.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.760]   But it's genuinely unlimited data.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.840]   They don't throttle you or any of that stuff.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.360]   If you have an individual plan, then there's a throttling process where after a certain
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.800]   number of whatever data they cut you off until the month kicks over to the new month
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   or whatever.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:41.080]   But for a family plan, I believe it's actually unlimited data, which is rare these days.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.240]   Normally, you have to be grandfathered in or whatever.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.480]   And that's keeping a lot of people on AT&T, for example.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   So that's good news.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.520]   So at the event, John LeGier said AWS for the iPhone 5.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.800]   I think there's something where you get limited data plus is unlimited 2G, but you get a limited
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.720]   amount of 3G and then the more expensive plan, you have a much higher or close quote unquote
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   unlimited 3G.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   Have they announced pricing?
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.200]   I believe it was in the same announcement.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   Same event.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   Okay.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   New carrier rate plans.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.000]   Actually, they already went live.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.480]   Contract free pricing $70 a month for unlimited data talk and text.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.720]   That's a lot less than I'm paying.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.040]   And after they're the fourth place carrier, they're going to have to do something different
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.520]   to get attention and get customers.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.520]   Yep.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:31.520]   Up to 12 gigabytes of hotspot data as well through tiers of up to $110 a month.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.080]   So interesting.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.600]   I love seeing this.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.040]   This is why you want competition.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.960]   This is why you didn't want them to be purchased by somebody.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.080]   And I think this is great.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.320]   Well, what about the new iPhone?
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   June?
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.760]   Now, now June, this is a Gene Munster.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.840]   The highly respected analyst, Gene Munster, says June.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.560]   I heard August a couple of weeks ago.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.720]   And you I trust.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.160]   I've heard nothing to say that is coming.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.640]   And August is a soft window because the further the longer you're away, the further
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.360]   small things can change the window.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.680]   But it would sound like August previously.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.840]   And everything I've heard since then says, sounds like late August, sorry, late July,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   early August.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.640]   How could Jean get this so wrong?
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.840]   Same reason because he has Apple TV wrong every year.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.840]   A lot of it is facts to support a thesis and not the other way around.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.480]   It's a wishful thinking.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.760]   The amount of contradictory stuff I've heard about at least three different major Apple
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.600]   products over the past two months basically gets me going, OK, let's just say, I don't
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   know.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   It's going to happen sometime this year.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.920]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.360]   There's very few financial analysts who consistently provide accurate information because we're
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360]   not their customers.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   Right.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   They're not writing these things for us.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360]   Right.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.880]   They're writing them for this really a sales pitch in some ways.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.800]   Or a recommendation if you're less terrible.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.080]   Yeah, and also needs to be said that Apple makes the launch deliberately unpredictable.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.280]   The last thing they want is for their competitors to know exactly well in advance when they're
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.840]   going to ship the next iPhone because that changes the whole competitive dynamics.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.720]   They want it to be unpredictable.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.640]   Well, I'm asking this as a as a sincere question.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.840]   Is there evidence that they are shifting that window to make it more, excuse me, to
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:20.440]   give to deny their competitors an advantage and be able to predict a launch window?
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   I don't know.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.960]   I probably not.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.480]   It just is a rational thing for the leader in an industry like this to do.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.320]   I mean, they would be kind of foolish not to.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.560]   They do move it around a bit.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.600]   But it's it just makes rational sense that they don't want everybody to know exactly
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   when they're going to ship.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.720]   And also, I think another little bit of soft evidence is that is the distance between when
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.760]   they announce their announcement date and when the announcement date actually is.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.520]   They don't they don't say, oh, in four months, we're going to be we're going to have a big
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   announcement.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.600]   No, they're saying in three weeks or whatever it is.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   I don't know what the amount of time is, but it's pretty small window.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.320]   And it just makes sense that they want to be somewhere between summer and the holidays.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.160]   And there's a calculation there, but they don't want their competitors.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.040]   I'm sure that they don't want their competitors to know exactly when that's going to be.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.720]   There's like a three month window where they long they've typically launched.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.040]   And that's why I think we see the HTC one and the Galaxy S four in the spring, because
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.800]   it's so far away from Apple's window.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.760]   They're not anywhere near it.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.040]   They Apple has announced originally they announced the WWDC and they shipped in June
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.680]   and July and the last couple of years has been September and October.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.320]   Anything in those three months would not be surprising to me.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.920]   And I don't think many people are expecting to see it's as unpredictable as the launch
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.000]   has gotten and still fits into a rather predictable slot of two or three months.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.920]   We used to be thinking maybe we'll see something around WWDC, but even WWDC has become a soft
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.640]   target right now.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:56.160]   But it's first half of the year would be almost impossible to back as a rumor, but we
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.160]   still kind of know when things are going.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.240]   I think it's kind of it's weird, but most of these, most of the other manufacturers seem
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.600]   to be centering around some window after mobile roll Congress.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.920]   Everybody wants to be launching a new phone in the middle of what used to be the premier
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.040]   event for mobile technology because there's too much noise there.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.160]   But everybody seems to be huddling around that other that month or two that happens
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.160]   after it.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.320]   Meanwhile, Google has their own hard scheduled event of Google IO, which is when they almost
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.120]   always take the wraps off of the next generation of the Android operating system.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.760]   And probably that's going to be when they're going to be showing off a new Google, a new
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.120]   Nexus phone.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.120]   So or tablet.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120]   Yeah, tablet.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.640]   But also they've probably have something that they're going to need to show off in handsets
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.160]   at that time as well.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:50.040]   And yet another Guilcard in the Apple criminology is that Apple has been behaving differently
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.360]   lately around the competitive environment.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:02.600]   I mean, they got really defensive about the when the Galaxy S4 came out and they had this
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.040]   whole ad that came out that said, this is why the iPhone is really awesome.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.560]   Remember how awesome the iPhone is?
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.120]   I mean, this is weird behavior for Apple.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.040]   And so they seem kind of rattled by the HTC one and some of the, you know, the New Galaxy
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.960]   and some of the other phones.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   And so I don't think Apple is predictable as predictable as they used to be in terms
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.720]   of how they deal with their competition.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.240]   It's not so much different behavior, but it's behavior they only used to do in the Mac
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.680]   market and now they're doing in the iPhone market.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.080]   But the only way to get truly unpredictable with the phones is to go to multiple phones
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.280]   because then you can have two or three different releases in the year the way a Samsung does
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.560]   or another or a Blackberry is going to be doing as long as there's one phone a year because
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.040]   the realities of contract markets, they'll fall in the same window.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   Yep.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.880]   And how about the new iPad?
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.680]   Is that what's the date now on that?
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.960]   I think the big one maybe still spring and the spring like this is spring.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   Well, we heard originally April, April-ish.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.440]   I don't know if they can do it.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.120]   The challenge with the new iPads is they have to make the iPad 5, the design language of
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:11.600]   the iPad Mini and previously the choice was written a display battery life or the performance
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.560]   and you could choose two of those three.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.560]   And no one wants an iPad that has five hours of battery life.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.440]   So getting that into an iPad Mini style package is hard, but we heard they were trying for
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.480]   April and they're written in Mini sounds like it's not possible yet, which means that would
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.320]   be a September-October-ish device.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   Could there be two announcements?
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.280]   Could there be a big iPad and a little iPad, separate announcements?
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280]   Yep.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   That's the advantage of having multiple products.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.760]   Apple, especially last year, they haven't shown any reticence about decluttering their
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760]   release schedule.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.840]   When simply saying we've got one major product and we've got some software releases we can
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.160]   talk about at the same time.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.320]   And when's the Mac Pro coming out?
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.560]   They said end of the year.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.120]   Well, I'll have some newest for Pro users end of the year.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.240]   By the way, I'm sorry, go ahead Andy.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   No, I'm sorry, I was going to make a wise-ass comment.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.160]   I bet you're going to say something more intelligent than what I had to say about the idea
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.160]   of the...
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160]   Probably not.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:12.540]   But what I was going to say is that if we think it's difficult to predict now, just
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:18.240]   wait till Apple gets its new campus because their new campus comes with a shiny new room
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.480]   for announcing these things.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.520]   It's literally underground and we're not going to be able to see it and putting up posters
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.600]   and stuff in San Francisco and all that stuff.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.720]   They're going to say, okay, we're going to have this event this afternoon.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   Everybody show up.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.360]   You've got three hours to get here.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.440]   And it's just going to...
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.360]   These announcements are going to come out of nowhere.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.000]   I suspect.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   And that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.200]   Especially those of us who are journalists on the East Coast, I'm sure.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   Oh, you just come out.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.280]   You'll get a high-speed maglev right from Boston to underneath the campus, Andy.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.440]   I don't think any of the four of us will ever be invited to these things.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   Yes, it is really magic.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   I know I'm not.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.320]   I am going to do, on Thursday, we do a show called Know How, where we show you how to
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   do stuff.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:02.920]   And I'm going to do, take my existing mid-2010 Mac Pro, which is the last Mac Pro.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.840]   So it's almost three years old now.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.280]   And put in an SSD card and put in a new video card.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.880]   One thing I didn't know, but from the research on this, I found out and you knew this already.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:21.200]   Renee Ritchie is that since 10.8 of Mountain Lion, you've been able to use stock PC video
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   cards in Macs.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   I've heard this.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   I've never tried it.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.760]   And in fact, there's somebody in the chat room says, yeah, I've been using NVIDIA 670
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.720]   without any problems for some time, straight out of the box.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.360]   Now I went out and bought this ridiculously overpriced.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.400]   It's like 150 bucks more than the same card for a Windows machine.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.240]   Sapphire makes a Radeon 7950.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.440]   You paid Australian markup for that.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   I did.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.440]   I played Australian markup for it.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   So I'll put that in.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.320]   I might get a, I might see if I could just go out and get an NVIDIA stock NVIDIA card.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.040]   Run down the store.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.800]   Are there computer stores anymore?
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   I don't think so.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   Go to Egghead Software.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   No, the little stuff.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   Oh, shocks.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   With a nice VGA/EGA card.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.680]   There's still a computer land in Berkeley, but I think all they do is fix computers.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.040]   Anyway, if I can find one.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.600]   I think most of the computer stores mostly sell like Halloween costumes.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.520]   I think fries is the last standout.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   Fries?
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   I have to drive down a fries.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520]   Yeah, you might be right.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.440]   You want to take a field trip, Chad?
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.120]   Yeah, we'll record it.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   I wonder, I might be able to get it overnighted from Amazon.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.280]   What if I order it now?
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:35.360]   When I built my PC, I did new egg and Amazon comparisons and Amazon seemed to be cheaper
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   on just everything.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   You're kidding.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360]   I always thought new egg was like the best.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.520]   And on top of that, I got free due to a shipping because I'm an Amazon Prime member.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.080]   So they got me there.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.280]   So which one should I get?
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.400]   The Gigabyte or the EVGA or the MSI?
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.400]   They're all the same.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.600]   Same prices.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.040]   Simplify their SKUs.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.160]   All right, well, I'll order this.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.760]   It's an interesting experiment to see.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.520]   Just order them all.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.320]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.560]   MSI has been really good.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   I have a--
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.360]   I think they're all the same.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.720]   But you don't need an ACK driver.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.000]   The point is Apple now bundles drivers for these cards.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.560]   So if I pay a little extra, I can get it Thursday.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.200]   Wait a minute, isn't this Tuesday?
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.880]   What happened with the overnight?
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.360]   I guess it's too late in the day.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360]   Huh.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360]   Huh.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.960]   Anyway, I didn't want to waste your time with that.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   Well, I should do a Hackintosh.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.600]   You could make a Mac Pro Hackintosh, couldn't you?
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600]   People do.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.800]   Maybe that's the thing to do.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.080]   There's actually a very, very rich culture of people that are absolutely need that kind
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.920]   of a tower Mac performance with current Intel processors.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.600]   And having given up on waiting, there is a very, very massive culture on how to build
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.840]   those things with support forms and everything.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.600]   All right, the gigabyte I got, I could get the gig in Mac OS.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.840]   There's instructions for making it run Mac OS.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.000]   All right.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   So that'll be another one.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.320]   Since-- I mean, I'll have these cards.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.360]   I can just use them.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.560]   But can you make one with Thunderbolt?
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.800]   Perfect face for radio on our chair.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.320]   It says you can.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   That would be what I'd want.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   It's a Thunderbolt.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   That's what I did.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   I know how.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320]   You already did it?
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   But it wasn't a Hackintosh?
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   It was a Hackintosh.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320]   Why wasn't I watching?
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   I don't know.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   I wasn't here that day.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   Yeah, it's because I was--
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320]   So wait a minute.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.840]   Chad Johnson, you made a Hackintosh, which you probably turned back into a Windows machine.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.280]   Right, I have.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.960]   But it had a Thunderbolt port.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.160]   It has two Thunderbolt ports.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.680]   I got the gigabyte-- yeah, the one I just got, the 670 or--
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.080]   No, that's-- well, the motherboard.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.520]   I got the 680, I think, actually.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.520]   Yeah, the 4G.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.520]   You can do a video over Thunderbolt.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.520]   Say again?
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520]   You're going to do video over Thunderbolt?
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.120]   You know, I haven't even tested it.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   It's like--
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.120]   You put the port in.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120]   Does it work?
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   That's another matter.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.920]   Because I have a Thunderbolt display.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   Let's try it.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.840]   I made the Hackintosh, and then I am constantly in Windows playing video games.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.120]   I heard you need a separate password from the video card to send out the display.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.600]   There's some funky.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.600]   There's a way to do this.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600]   All right.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   Well, enough of that.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.840]   Hey, Macintosh, that looks like a classic NES console.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   That's what you got to do.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   It's worth it.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:18.080]   I will give you-- I'll give you a little preview, just a little preview, a little taste of what
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.440]   we're going to talk about on Thursday on The Know How Show.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:29.680]   I bought-- instead of buying an SSD that goes on the SATA bus, other world computing has
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.200]   an Express card SSD.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.120]   And holy cow, that's the fast.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.800]   It's much, much, much fast.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:43.200]   It's like 60% faster than the SSD on an SATA bus.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   Zoom, zoom.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.200]   Zoom, zoom.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.600]   Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.000]   So if you're going to do one upgrade, that'd probably be the best one.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   Yeah, see right there?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   You just scroll past it.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.480]   The Mercury Excelsior.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.400]   And you could put-- as sticks get bigger, those are just sticks.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.880]   So you could upgrade it down the road with more memory as a sticks get bigger.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:08.240]   Not cheap, but it was almost 500 bucks for what, 220 gigs.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   But boy fast.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   And once you do it, you can never ever go back.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   That's the problem.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.120]   In fact, that was really-- that was one of the reasons I stopped using the Mac Pro because
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.000]   everything else I have is SSD.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And you kind of get used to that.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   Now, waiting for it.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   You can hear the drive.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   [HUMMING]
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.840]   You know, it's like-- I don't-- yeah.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.400]   It's like going back on dial up.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   It's the broadband.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.280]   Speed is so subjective.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.400]   You have all these really antiquated benchmark tests that will tell you how much it can do
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.840]   floating point-- how fast it can do floating point math when you realize that, well, most
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.960]   people when they're using their computers, all that CPU power, all those 8 cores are
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.320]   basically spent flashing the cursor while it waits for you to type the next thing.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.200]   And so it's something like a display refresh and hard disk access, drive access is actually
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.400]   much more important than raw CPU power.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.440]   I/O is everything.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:04.720]   So interesting article in 9 to 5 Mac saying basically the Retina-- Mac Pro Retinas are
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720]   junk.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   Don't buy them.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   They're horrible.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720]   They're troubled.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.360]   I have loved mine from the day I got it.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.360]   I haven't had ghosting.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.640]   I haven't had any of the weird-- as far as I can tell.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.960]   I don't even want to read this too closely in case I do have it and I just don't know
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   it.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   And now I'll see it and I won't like it anymore.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   I have tons of ghosting.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   You do?
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.480]   I cannot go to during a fireball without the window looking transparent.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.680]   But it doesn't bother me enough to have it changed yet.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:32.320]   The article written by Jordan Kahn, MacBook Pro with Retina Display problems in every
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   dimension.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.320]   Apparently, they use both LG and Samsung displays.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.640]   The LGs have all sorts of problems with ghosting.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.920]   Even the Samsung displays, according to this article, aren't totally free from issues.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.200]   There was an update after that article that some people said it made it better if I haven't
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.200]   tried it yet.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   Software update.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200]   Really?
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.360]   So the ghosting isn't like burning on the display.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   It's weird.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.320]   If there's a light color image, you'll see the outline of the light colored image on top
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.680]   of the gray that you're seeing on the screen.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   But it fades out?
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.440]   There's an easy fix for it.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.320]   Just bring back the flying toaster screen.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:19.240]   Apple actually has a support article, TP949, Image Persistence Test, that you can run a
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.920]   display mic show a temporary faint remnant of a previous image even after a new image
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   replaces it.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.240]   The follow instructions using Procedure listed for this computer at the Apple support article
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.600]   TP949 to determine if it fails or passes this test.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.480]   This is for the genius to do, in other words.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.200]   They do like a checkerboard pattern.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.080]   Apple apparently isn't telling people, even though they've had this knowledge based article.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.480]   I haven't seen it, but I know I'm going to see it.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.000]   I'm going to see it, right?
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   I'm going to find it.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.440]   Well, if you have one of those Samsung panels that's good, you won't see it.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.320]   The problem is that the genius is, my understanding is the genius is don't know what replacement
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.320]   part they're going to get.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.720]   So if you ask for a Samsung.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.720]   You can't necessarily get.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.440]   And then some people had to switch multiple times and keep getting the same sort of ghosting
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   panel.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.120]   This is apparently a problem with IPS displays, particularly this in-plane switching, especially
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.800]   those made by LG.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   It is weird.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.000]   I mean, I have the same problem when I was reviewing the retina MacBook as I did when
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.120]   I was talking about the Chromebook Pixel, where you have a lot of respect for the hardware.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.480]   You think it's a very impressive thing, but I find I had a lot of difficulty trying to
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   figure out for whom I would recommend this, because as it was, it's a very peculiar notebook
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.760]   that costs a hell of a lot of money, doesn't have a hell of a lot of features, has one
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.960]   absolute spotlight feature being that super high density display.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.480]   But it's hard to know for whom is that display going to be justify the disadvantages and
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.840]   the extra expense.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.080]   I really did like the piece that John Cirqueuse wrote a couple of weeks ago, liken it to
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:53.920]   that really high end 4GMs supercar that they make, knowing that the car company, knowing
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.760]   that this is not going to be the thing that they're going to sell in boatload quantities,
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.480]   but it's going to increase the luster and the lower of the whole brand.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.360]   And hopefully this is going to be technology that they can work out at this high end and
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.240]   then figure out how to trickle it down to the low end once it becomes more practical.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:15.360]   But as it is, it's like, again, a really cool $2,500 laptop with no ethernet port, but I'm
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.800]   much sure that the extra $1,500.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.600]   The moral of the story is ignorance is bliss.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.240]   It's better to not know anything about these problems better than never.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.160]   Yeah, I still think this is the best computer I've ever had.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.600]   I'm feeling like an idiot.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.600]   I know.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   Maybe I.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   Huh?
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.600]   I own the computer.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600]   I have the ghost thing and doesn't bother me.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   It's my main computer.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600]   I love it.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600]   Here's the thing.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.760]   Here's the thing, Leo.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.960]   You can't go back.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.480]   I mean, if you look at an on if you look at a MacBook that's not a retina display, it
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   looks horrible.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   It's like sandpaper on your eyes.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.920]   I had a I had the retina MacBook for a month, maybe two months on loan while I was reviewing
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.160]   it.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:57.600]   I could never go back to a non retina iPad, but a non retina Mac was for me at least no
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   difficulty.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   The thing is, I think Andy's right.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600]   These are aspirational products.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.400]   And if you remember the very first MacBook Air, it wasn't right.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.600]   It wasn't a great machine, but you could see where Apple was going and now we have fantastic
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.840]   MacBook Airs.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.200]   And you can see when the GPUs get better and the IPS displays get better, we'll have
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.680]   fantastic retina Macs.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.440]   I think I have to admit it that I've crossed some kind of spiritual and emotional Rubicon.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.840]   I now have more money than sense.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.640]   I bought a pixel as well.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.720]   And I'm just spending money like the best web browser you've ever owned.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.080]   I know, but I like it.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   I know.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.240]   Well, I have a got a screen compared to the retina.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.240]   I haven't got it yet.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240]   I'll let you know.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.240]   The screen I got the LTE version, I'm getting it April 8th apparently.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.800]   They've the same palatable wider.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.200]   The problem with the pixels that there are not as many opportunities to show off that
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.200]   display.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.440]   I mean, what really, really sold the retina MacBook to me was the first time I was using
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.200]   aperture and realizing that I'm seeing every as I'm trying to figure out how to fix this
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.600]   photo, I'm seeing every micron of detail that's available.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.400]   Final Cut Pro too is fantastic.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   I like that.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   I've had this.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   I've had this.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   I've had this.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.080]   One of my favorite photos is a photo of my one of my friends dogs is adorable dog.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.600]   And this is the first time I noticed an oh, wow, you can actually see my reflection in
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   the dog's eyeball.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.880]   And I was just like, I was a one to one zoom that was just like eight by 10 image that
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   was in there.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.960]   Like, all right, I suppose this is a very nice display.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.320]   Yeah, I could never go back.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   I'm just so used to it now.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   OK, I don't feel so bad.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.400]   Because I mean, part of the reason I buy these is because I'm going to review them.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.520]   I want to be able to talk about them responsibly.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.120]   But then you get hooked and I this MacBook Pro with retina, it feels like it's even faster
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.120]   than my Mac Pro.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.640]   It is ridiculously fast.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.400]   So all of this.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.720]   So I haven't seen the ghosting.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   Maybe I'm not looking right.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720]   I'll look tonight.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.480]   I render Final Cut Pro on my MacBook Pro more than my master.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.040]   Yeah, it is.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.080]   There's also a you can put a thing in terminal to find out what panel you have.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   Right.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.040]   So or even about this Mac, if you drill down, you can see what kind of panel you have.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   Be happy Leo.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.040]   It's a good machine.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.000]   First chapter, Steve Jobs manga, previewed online.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.960]   I know this is one that Andy Inako is fascinated by.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.960]   Are you a manga?
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.600]   Are you an anime fan?
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.480]   Uh, not really because I've I've had friends who've tried to let get me into manga.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.920]   And at some point, either a the story is all about the green mysterious glowy thing that
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:23.680]   represents the vengeance of the earth against humanity that keeps trying to poison it or
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.080]   it gets really, really creepy.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.560]   And I have to burn it and pretend that I never actually saw that image.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560]   This looks pretty good.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.360]   This is by it's in Japanese.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.840]   Um, by a war.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.880]   I think that was the sugar water scene.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   Is it with with?
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.640]   Oh, yeah, he's walking in the woods with Scully.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   You're right.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.240]   Right at the top there.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240]   Wow.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240]   I don't know.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240]   That's kind of cool.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   It's better than the Kutcher movie.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   It has to be.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.560]   It's got to be better than the Ashton Kutcher movie, which is now apparently just been
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.920]   a limbo limbo.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:58.760]   They showed it that was Sundance and then they suddenly said, we want to put together
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.160]   a marketing plan for this.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.800]   So we won't release this right away.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.160]   70s show reunion is looking like a better idea.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.600]   We're going to we're going to delay it until everybody forgot what Steve Jobs.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.960]   It was really like, yeah.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.400]   We're going to wait till was is dead so he can't say how stupid the movie was.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:21.000]   Then there's the Aaron Sorkin Sony version, which I presume they're busy hard at work
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   at.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   But this looks better.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   There are no tentacles in this.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   No.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   No nuns.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   There are spectacles.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.600]   And the eyes are kind of normal sized.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.520]   I think he actually looks like Steve, which is kind of nice.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.520]   Good job.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.520]   It even looked like John Scully.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.120]   I mean, you could identify it as John Scully from the picture.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   This looks good.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.040]   I hope that they have an English translation.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.760]   And on I books are kindle would be nice.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.880]   Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   Comixology, right?
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.520]   Did you ask them at Comixology when you visited with them, Andy?
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.240]   I did not ask them about manga, although they're doing they're doing they're doing some
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.400]   really incredible things.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.960]   It's like they're moving of it's they showed me they showed me the last time I visited their
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.360]   offices was a year ago.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.560]   So they I got to see their new larger offices, which they're now moving out of because they're
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.040]   moving into even larger offices in the next few weeks.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   Common seven future.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040]   They're they're doing really well.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.200]   So so long as they so long as they can get dark horse comics in the in the stable at some
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.960]   point, that's going to be that's that's going to run the table.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   That'd be great.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   Real quickly.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   I mean, we're just run through a few stories.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.400]   We got a bunch of students here in the live studio.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.720]   And so they're getting bored to tears.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.960]   So I don't I don't want to get to.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.240]   There's three young ladies in the front row.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240]   This is good.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.240]   Like when is this going to be over?
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.400]   I cannot get my baseball cap and wear it sideways.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.600]   I don't think it'll help.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.840]   I was the one that was warm.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.320]   Quick silvers back.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.520]   It's out of beta for the first time in 10 years.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   1.0.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:48.240]   This is the program Alcor started writing, which I put on every machine because I love
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.360]   it.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.680]   Then Google bought Alcor hired Alcor and another team took it over as I guess as an open source
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.680]   project.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.680]   It's 1.0.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.600]   And I immediately took Alfred off of my MacBook Pro with the retina display and put quick
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   silver back.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.840]   It's just a nostalgia trip, but I always like quick silver.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.840]   I think silver is wonderful.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.560]   So just something you might want to take a look at.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.480]   Department of Defense will be purchasing 650,000 iOS devices.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.760]   They have denied that subsequently.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.480]   Oh, come on.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.080]   Admit it, DOD.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.640]   There is an OS 10 Trojan that Apple has blocked in their in their P list already.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:35.840]   So don't worry about it in JEX ads or forces you to go to pages in your browser.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:42.240]   Hanhai posting record profits, making Apple products.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.560]   And I think that's anything else.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.120]   The Apple tax, Apple says the reason why it costs so much for Apple stuff in Australia
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.960]   is because the rights, it's all the rights holders, faults.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.480]   That's why we've charged 70% more.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.000]   Adobe probably says the same thing.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.880]   We remember this is the conversation we had about Adobe charging so much for their software.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.200]   The software has to be imported, has to be put on a ship and sent across the ocean.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.080]   It's the freight expense.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.640]   You have to print all those manuals.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.440]   That Adobe software is heavy.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.440]   Heavy.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.280]   That's a lot of three and a half of the copies, man.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.480]   Eric Schmidt says it's up to Apple to get Google.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.920]   That was the worst story last week on the iPhone.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.920]   It's not us.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920]   It's Apple.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.000]   Did you follow that story, Leo?
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.480]   That was horrendous last week.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   So what happened?
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.080]   So Eric Schmidt said that he was asked about Google now and it was at a conference in
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.800]   India and he said you have to ask Apple.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.720]   And people sort of wonder what do you mean you have to ask Apple?
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   Is Apple coding it?
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.720]   No.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.120]   So everyone thought, oh, Google submitted it and Apple put it in a drawer somewhere just
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.960]   like they did with, you know, took their time with maps, took their time with Google
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:52.960]   voice.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.200]   And then Apple put out a statement saying Google now has not been submitted to the
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   store.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   So people said Apple's lying.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   It's not coming as Google now.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   It's coming as an update to Google search.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   Apple must be lying.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:07.000]   And then Apple said we don't have any products from Mountain View in review.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.280]   And then finally Google came out and said we have not submitted this to Apple.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.680]   And finally then some people started to believe Apple that really they weren't doing anything
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.040]   evil with Google now.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040]   But after.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040]   Well, thank you, Eric.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.560]   So Eric misstated the which he has want to do.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560]   He's done this several times.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.440]   He's Mr. Foote and got to go to the meetings anymore.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.800]   I heard I was watching Mac break weekly.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.200]   We were shocked that Apple stopped using our math.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.200]   Shocked.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.200]   We're shocked.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.200]   I read TMZ.com.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.440]   OK, so there you go.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.600]   So you know, if you want Google now get an Android device, it'll work better anyway because
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.720]   it's never going to have access to the things that it needs to have access to on the Apple
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720]   side.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.080]   In my opinion, it'll be a neutered version.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.160]   It'll be neutered.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.520]   Um, let's take a break.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:53.480]   When we come back, our software picks of the week, some very good news.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.560]   I hope I didn't steal anybody's Quicksilver tip.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   Nope.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.920]   Mike Elgin in Valencia, Spain.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.520]   Mr. Renee Richie from Montreal visiting via i'more.com and Andy Inaco from Boston.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.040]   More of Mac break weekly in just a moment.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:11.360]   But first, ah, little word from pond five.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.480]   You know, I was reading about them.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.280]   The Fufa raw.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.520]   Um, you know, there was a company called I stock photo that was purchased by Getty images.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:23.160]   And the guy I found at I stock photo was later fired by Getty images because he was complaining
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.480]   that it was so that they took such a big stake out of it.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.320]   And now he's starting kind of some sort of boutiquey stock image thing.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.060]   And I had to think, boy, you know, that's why I like pond five, pond five.
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.040]   He was saying, we're going on this new boutique thing.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.080]   We're going to give 50% royalties.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.760]   Pond five's been doing that all along.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.480]   That's what I love about pond five.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.560]   Pond five treats everybody in the transaction with respect.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.560]   What is pond five?
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:53.320]   It is a stock media marketplace media for people who make media for both sellers and buyers.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:59.480]   In fact, pond five told me that almost like the majority of pond five users both sell and
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.560]   buy stock media here.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.960]   This is what we call royalty free.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.360]   That means you pay for it once you can use it in your presentations on your website and
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.160]   your podcast, wherever they've got a huge collection.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.640]   I'm not surprised because media makers love pond five because they get to set their own
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.280]   price and they get 50%.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.080]   That's industry leading royalties.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.520]   You're going to get 1.5 million stock videos to choose from 8.2 million photos, 753,000
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.560]   vector illustrations, 383,000 music and sound effects tracks.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.360]   They've got 3D models.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.040]   They've got after effects projects.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.160]   And their browser makes it so easy to find what you want.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.840]   Chats using it right now just to browse around inside pond five.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.840]   Couldn't be easier.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.240]   I think there's a free stock clip so you should go to pond five.com.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.120]   This week it's particles with alpha channel.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.760]   I don't even know what it is, but it's a 1080p clip that costs you nothing.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   I don't know what that is.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.760]   It's pretty though.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.120]   You see that'd be good for like your PowerPoint or your keynote presentation.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.760]   And the alpha channel means that that black part will be transparent when you bring it
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   into a whole dude.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.720]   So you could do that over video if you wanted like some dream sequence or something like
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.720]   that.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.800]   See how you know how to use this stuff.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.080]   So I think it's a really cool deal for you when you go to pond five.com/macbreak.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:23.680]   They've got 50 count them, five zero free stock media files for you to use all for yourself,
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.640]   forever and ever.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.200]   Audio, sound effects, pictures, videos.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.960]   It's a way, you know, you get two things out of this.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.880]   First of all, you get this great library of stuff you can use.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.200]   No, and the watermark's not in this stuff when you download it.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.800]   But secondly, it gets you introduced to pond five to the media browser, sign you up for
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.160]   an account, free account so that you, next time you need media, it's easy and fast for
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.960]   you to get an image or a sound effect or whatever you need from pond five.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   You got to try it.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.280]   Pond five.com/macbreak pond five.com/macbreak.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.760]   Get your 50 free media files now.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.520]   It's a limited time offers.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.240]   Do not delay time for our picks of the week.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.920]   We'll start to my left, Mr. Andy and not co.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.280]   This is not necessarily a software pick, maybe necessary specifically an Apple stuff pick,
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:17.400]   but this is the Roku three, which I very much in love with right now, because it's got
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.000]   a hunk of people at Apple that this is actually a little bit smaller than the Apple TV.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.600]   Very, very functionally similar.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.520]   You've got this streaming media box.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.040]   It has got, you know, ethernet, HDMI also has a storage slot so that you can add your
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.560]   own media and add your own storage there.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.720]   I love it because they've added some nice features with this one.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.120]   New interface that's a lot easier to navigate.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:48.760]   Also the remote is really nicely done where it's actually a Wi-Fi device, not an infrared
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:49.760]   device.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.920]   So it doesn't really, you can put, if you don't want to have this perched on top of
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.760]   a shelf anywhere, you can actually hide it if you'd like because slants is within radio
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760]   distance.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760]   It'll actually work.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   So it doesn't matter, re-pointing it.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.720]   Also the remote has one of these on the side of it.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.040]   It actually has a headphone jack.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.840]   So you can be like in bed with your own headphones plugged in and you're the only person in the
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.200]   room who can actually hear what you're doing.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:22.160]   And whether it's an interesting choice for someone who is an Apple person because there
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.160]   will always be a definitive advantage to Apple TV and that it will always be an AirPlay
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160]   receiver.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.760]   And so that I think is, if you spend any amount of time with information that's, excuse me,
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:40.400]   the content that's on your MacBook or your iPhone or iPad, I do think that's a definitive
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   advantage.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:47.600]   However, the great thing about the Roku box is that they're a little bit more open in
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.360]   terms of the number of channels.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.640]   You don't have a YouTube player that kind of bites, but you do have things like an
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.960]   Arial app.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:30:00.600]   So once Arial, that really great streaming broadcast TV app becomes available in your
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.160]   city and it's going to be available in 22 more cities at the, by the end of the spring.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:11.880]   I just installed it on this device yesterday and the ability of, I've attached this $99
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.600]   Roku box to any TV I have.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.440]   And now I've got every channel that's being broadcast.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.400]   I've also have access to DVR content everywhere.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:26.480]   It's such a nice thing that I think that area, if you're in an Arial city, that doesn't necessarily
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.840]   negate the advantage of Apple TV with AirPlay, but man, that's a strong counter argument
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.840]   to that feature.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:36.040]   Or if you're a time Warner subscriber, because they have an app that gives you live TV on
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040]   it too.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:42.520]   And that really is like the systemic advantage of Roku and that they are more open to third-party
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   channels.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.560]   They have a curated store of free channels with all the usual suspects.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.520]   That is already a lot of us.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   Exactly.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.800]   That's already a wider palette of options than you get on Apple TV, but also you can get
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:00.160]   sort of off books channels, including the Arial channel, including all kinds of other
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:06.640]   features that will give you PBS and CNN and BBC International and stuff like that.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.480]   So again, not exactly a slam dunk, but it's an interesting step forward.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   I keep saying that to finally cancel your cable subscription and get all your TV off
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.440]   the internet, it's not a single decision you make.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.480]   It's more like it's a game you're playing in which once you get 100 points, you cut cable.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.000]   Before I got Roku 3 and installed Arial on it, I was at 93 points.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.280]   Now I think I'm at 96, 97 points.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.880]   I would only take one more thing to complete a piece of the puzzle for me to cancel cable
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.160]   now.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.560]   And that's really due to Roku 3.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:48.800]   There's a Roku channels database, www.roku-channels.com that lists a lot of these off-book Roku channels.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.840]   And in most cases, you just need to go to a website and enter a code to add it to your
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   Roku.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.440]   And there's thousands of channels or hundreds anyway.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:04.760]   Yeah, and the fact that it's so open is the reason why it's so easy to sort of get
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:06.840]   around whatever limitation you think there is about it.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:13.560]   For instance, no, you can't get AirPlay streaming, but what you can get is install a home media
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:17.600]   server anywhere on any of your Macs or PCs in the whole house.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.920]   And now that can be a receiver for all of that content anywhere.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.440]   So that doesn't negate the disadvantage of not having AirPlay, but in many ways, for
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:29.160]   many people, that's going to sort of equal the features you're going to get from it.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.760]   Yeah, that's kind of the trade-off, exactly.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:32.760]   You don't get an iTunes store.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.760]   You don't get AirPlay.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.480]   It's not an Apple-specific device.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.920]   My mom is visiting, right?
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   She's 80 years old.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.720]   She's a little deep.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:43.120]   I set her up with headphones in the remote control.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.640]   She could turn up as loud as she wants.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.640]   It's wonderful.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.200]   She's got a little TV in her room.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.200]   It's just great.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.200]   I love that.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.560]   And the sound quality is excellent on the wireless.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.560]   I was surprised.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.280]   I thought to be latency or some degradation, but it sounds really good.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.320]   Impressive.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320]   Good recommendation.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320]   99 bucks.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.320]   Roku.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   ROKULabs.com.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.320]   How about you, Mr. Renee Ricci?
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   What do you like these days?
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   Not your Z-10.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.520]   No, I do have a Z-10 here somewhere.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520]   One of these points.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.160]   All Canadians have to have by law.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:18.560]   You have to have a Blackberry by law.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.560]   It's part of our subsidy.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.600]   It's like health care.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.560]   My pick is not a new app, but it's an app that was updated today.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.120]   I'm going to ask the chat room to help me.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.760]   If you could @ReneeRitchie on Twitter, we'll demonstrate it.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.360]   But Twitterific, some would say finally launched push notifications this morning.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:38.240]   They're doing it gradually because they don't want their server to smack to a crash and burn
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.240]   over load.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.520]   But if you install a new Twitterific and you turn on push notifications, and they've added
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.160]   almost a little emoji looking-- I'll see if I can show any of them here-- little emoji-looking
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   icons to them.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.000]   So you can see it's a little recycle symbol.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.880]   If it's a retweet, it's a little-- here they come.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.960]   Little diamond, if it's a-- Oh, that's neat.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   --mentioned.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.560]   And they're doing-- I wish they had one of this.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.560]   This way.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560]   Testing-- what is this?
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.560]   Testing notifications for what program now?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.560]   Twitterific.
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   Twitterific.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560]   Twitterific.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.960]   And it's really well done.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.120]   They're coming in very quickly.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.840]   I like the little icon there because it shows me immediately what kind of message it is.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840]   Those are all mentions.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.880]   There's a-- someone who followed me on Twitter is the green plus sign.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.720]   Boy, you could fill up your notifications pretty quick there.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720]   You don't have to turn them all on.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.720]   It's very granular.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.080]   I'll open up the app so that you can see.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.560]   But it's very-- like the icon factory takes a lot of attention.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.360]   They spend a lot of time on the details of the app.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.800]   And they weren't the first to do push notifications, but they've done a really, really good job
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.800]   of it.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800]   I'm going to open up the--
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800]   Like that.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.800]   Sorry.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.800]   Might want to change your passcode now.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   Yeah, you gave away your passcode.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.800]   But somebody's got to get your phone.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]   It's a traveling passcode.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.720]   It's not a huge deal.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.440]   If I go to my account here and I click on my-- where's my settings?
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440]   Right here.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.440]   Having user--
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.160]   Well, since you hit the server alerts without using any of your text messages, you've gotten
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.480]   your data plan.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.440]   You can-- I'm doing a very poor job of it here, but you can granulally set which notifications
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   you want.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.600]   You can turn them on so it's just mentions or just retweets or just favorites.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:19.800]   And they have-- the other thing I should mention about Twitterfic is not all Twitter apps have
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.080]   good accessibility.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.800]   A lot of them render things to the frame buffer to make them move very quickly.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.680]   Twitterfic is using standard control, so all the good stuff that iOS does for voiceover
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.520]   support and for other support, it is all in there.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.040]   I learned that when I got the retina display that-- how many-- I was surprised how many
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.800]   apps just kind of did a JPEG kind of the tweets.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.000]   Lauren Richter, the guy who did the original tweet, he did that.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.760]   He would just render-- he made a tweet for that and it flows--
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]   Made it fast.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   --to be quite fast.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.320]   So fast, but the tweetbot have gone back now and added the accessibility back in, but
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.400]   the icon factory has always been very good about being really first class citizens.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   Because of way shit.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   All that stuff.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.960]   And a lot of people didn't go with Twitterfic simply because it didn't have push notifications.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.720]   It was like the last big hurdle and now they've added that.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.360]   And again, you'll get in in batches.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   They're not making you wait in line.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.840]   There's no queue.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.400]   But you can enable it.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.760]   And when they have the server capacity for it, it'll start working.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.760]   Tweetbot does have notifications.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:16.760]   Tweetbot has.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.760]   Tweetbot has.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:22.960]   And they were one of the first to have a really robust, really good set of push notifications
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   for Twitter.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.960]   That's what I've been using.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.360]   But I love Twitterfic and I love icon factories.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.760]   And the design is just beautiful.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:28.760]   Yeah, it's gorgeous.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.760]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.760]   It's dark.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.760]   Love that.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.760]   Very fly.
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.760]   Very nice.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760]   Mr. Mike Elgin.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   Yes.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:37.760]   Yeah, what's your recommendation?
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:41.000]   Well, I have a very counterintuitive recommendation.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.840]   When I was a Windows user, I was probably three or four months before I switched to the
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.600]   Mac world from the PC.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.880]   I was really getting into Dragon Naturally Speaking, which is a dictation software that
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.680]   lets you control your interface with your voice.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.560]   And then I switched to Mac and then it's expensive.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.600]   I didn't buy it again and so on.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:09.360]   And then when Mountain Line came out, there's actually built-in speech recognition in Mountain
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   Line.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.760]   A lot of people don't know this is in there.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.520]   And so part of my recommendation is for people to learn and sort of force themselves to get
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.880]   in the habit of using speech dictation because it's wonderful once you have that habit.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.600]   That's the general tip and look for a Mountain Line.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.240]   Just hit function key twice and start talking.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.640]   And it's similar to what you find on the iPhone and iPad.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   It's not great.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.360]   You don't have to train it.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.840]   It works pretty well.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.160]   But again, the biggest hurdle is developing the habit.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.720]   My specific recommendation is that I finally fit the bullet and purchased Dragon Dictate
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:55.120]   3, which is the current version from Nuance, of their speech dictation software.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   It's expensive.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.400]   It's 200 bucks.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:06.040]   The purchasing process is from the 90s and it's antiquated and all that stuff.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   And then you have to train it.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.320]   So all those things are things that kind of have people don't do that kind of stuff anymore,
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.200]   especially since a pretty good dictation software is free in Mountain Line.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.760]   But I still recommend it for anybody who is a blogger or who writes or who does a lot
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.800]   of email or whatever because once you've trained it and gotten in the habit of using
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:29.440]   it, it's fantastically good to be able to just talk and have things written for you
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.800]   without typing.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.600]   It also can be healthy because I like to sometimes dictate while I'm standing up.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.120]   We all sit too much probably and that's bad for your health.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.160]   The other benefit is that there's a free app that goes with it called Dragon Recorder.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.680]   And what you do with Dragon Recorder is you open the app, you start talking, you can sit
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.360]   there and record for half an hour.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.480]   And you're giving commands like an X paragraph and you put in the punctuation commas, periods
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.480]   and all that stuff.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.160]   And then when you get back to your Mac, you plug it in and it uploads and then you've
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.120]   got the document that you spoke all laid out.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.320]   So this is great also for exercise because you can go take a walk and when you come back,
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.480]   you've got a column written or a blog post written or an email written.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.040]   So it's really fantastic and for people who are willing to put up with the price and
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.800]   the training, there's nothing like it.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.800]   Pretty cool.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:27.680]   Well, I have to say I've done it again.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:35.040]   I think an unearned reputation for when I buy something, then Apple releases the new
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.040]   thing.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:42.960]   So on February 18th, I bought the entire NIC software collection for Aperture in Lightroom.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.520]   Why are you laughing at it?
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.520]   Thank you Leo.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.920]   February 18th, I bought it.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:55.040]   I bought it before but I needed update Silver Effects and there were a few updates.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.200]   So today Google announces the whole collection, just $149.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.200]   Thank you Leo.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.200]   Yeah, you can thank me later.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.160]   Actually, the good news is they've sent out email and they said anybody, this is amazing.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.160]   Praise Google.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.560]   I was very worried when Google bought Nick.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   We thought they wanted Snap Seed, which is the iOS app and probably didn't care about
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.840]   these plugins, which many photographers agree are the best plugins available for Photoshop,
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.600]   Lightroom and Aperture.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.440]   Their Silver Effects Pro is absolutely the best monochrome plugin.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.800]   Just amazing.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.120]   And so we were all worried, oh my God, what's Google going to do with the desktop?
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.280]   Then they killed Snap Seed for the desktop a couple of days ago and I thought, oh, oh,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.680]   well here's the good news.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:43.640]   Anybody who's purchased Nick's software in the last five years gets an upgrade and those
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:50.840]   of us who stupidly purchased it for $300 just a few weeks ago get a refund.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.640]   And I highly recommend this.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:01.320]   The full Nick collection includes a bunch of plugins, US customers or EU, but the price
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:09.720]   is $149 and it is just, for Silver Effects Pro 2 by itself is worth it, but they have
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.160]   a bunch of other stuff.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.680]   These are really great plugins at $149.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:18.920]   You can try before you buy, recommend that if you use Lightroom or Aperture or Photoshop,
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920]   certainly worth taking a look at.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.280]   15-day free trial.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:26.640]   Thank you, Google, for not only not killing Nick's software and not only dropping the
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.840]   price to half what it was, but for honoring those of us who've been spending money on
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.320]   Nick's software for years, we get a little bit of a benefit to it.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.560]   Thanks, Leo, for triggering it for the rest of us.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.200]   I can't believe this.
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.280]   I really don't think this is true that when I buy stuff, new stuff comes out.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   I really don't.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.840]   But if a Mac Pro comes out in the next two weeks and I've spent $1,500 to upgrade my
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.880]   old Mac Pro, you can thank me for that too.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.160]   Hey, I thank you for making the trip to the Brickhouse Renee Richie, iMore.com.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:57.120]   If you want to keep up on the rumors about the iPhone and them, you just showed me something
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.480]   that is great, which you cannot put on the site.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.200]   You got great sources.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.200]   And great sources.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200]   Can we get a big plug in?
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200]   We were thrilled.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.440]   We had the chance to interview Don Melton earlier this week.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.200]   If you're not familiar with him, he's the one who opened, he was just a little bit of
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.920]   responsible for helping to open source Mozilla.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.880]   He also made modelists for Gnome.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.960]   And then he was hired by Scott Forestall.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.640]   And he created WebKit and Safari for the Mac.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   He's the guy.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640]   And then the other tip.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.640]   And he was really candid.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.120]   It said iMore.com/debug.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.360]   He was really candid on the interview.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.280]   He spoke a lot about how the project was.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.480]   He's not Apple now, right?
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.080]   He retired last year.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.880]   He talked about why they chose Conqueror as the foundation of KML, KML.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880]   Sorry, KDS.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.040]   Conqueror became WebKit.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   Yes.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.360]   I don't know what spoilers, but I believe the Gecko code was supposed to be bigger than
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.840]   the OS X code when they were first looking at it.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.960]   And that was a no-go for Bertrand Solet.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.440]   Oh, this is great.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.280]   It was a fantastic hour and a half.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.680]   And we were really thrilled to have him.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.680]   And if you're a fan of, if you use WebKit, which includes the Android browser, the Blackberry
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.360]   browser, WebOS, Nokia is changing to it.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   Chrome.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.840]   He's a guy you have a lot of thanks for that technology.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.840]   And I'm more and more.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.040]   One of the podcasts that Renata has a dime more.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.040]   And debug number 11 has Don Milton.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   I'm definitely put that on my phone and listen to that on the way home.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.040]   That's great.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Can't wait to hear that.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.040]   Thrill to have him.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.040]   I am ORE.com, folks.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.040]   That's a great sight.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:27.360]   We want to thank Mr. Mike Elgin for making the trip in from Valencia, Spain.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.360]   Thank you.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.360]   So great to have you.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   You can follow Mike on Google+, or just go to MikeElgin.com.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.600]   It'll take you to his Google+ page.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.000]   It's a will.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.360]   And anything else you want to plug?
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.760]   Well, I'm now in addition to Cultimac computer world animation and hows.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.120]   I'm now writing for Cultive Android.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.440]   I'm sure this audience will be thrilled.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:51.120]   How do you have an Android phone?
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.120]   I do.
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.640]   I have an Android phone and an Android tablet, and I'm looking at a Pixel.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:03.880]   So I can actually, I'm actually going to try to go all Google starting in a couple of
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:10.680]   weeks, 100% Google hardware, 100% Google software, and compare it to what I have now,
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.840]   which is 100% Apple everything, and sort of mix and match and see what the benefits and
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.080]   hardships are with that.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.080]   It's going to be temporary.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.000]   It's going to do it for one month.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   Awesome.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   Yeah, I'm kind of doing the same thing.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   That's why I bought the Pixel.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.840]   I thought I should give it a try.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.840]   I tried Windows 8.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.840]   Can't be any worse than that.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.840]   No.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.840]   Cannot.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.280]   Andy Anako Chicago Sun Times.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.720]   He is the king of Mac analysts, and it's always great to have you on Hatless or not.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.720]   What is that?
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.480]   Oh, you took down the sorting bin that was on your iPad there.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.480]   What was that?
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.480]   Tootsie Pops.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:54.560]   No, I was at the, those are multi, I was at the PAX East of the weekend.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.360]   And so those are like gaming die.
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.360]   Oh, they're die.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.360]   D20s.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.360]   Multi-sided die.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.880]   Yeah, now I can see.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.040]   Every color, every size.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.960]   And of course, this was just like one bin of like 40 at this one retailer had.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:12.240]   Those are the only ones that aren't made out of like the bones of dead gods.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:16.240]   So they keep those in her glass.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.920]   We do Mac very quickly, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC Tuesdays at twit.tv.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.000]   If you can watch live, we would love it.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.400]   But if you can't, we've got on demand audio and version and video versions available after
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:38.800]   the fact at twit.tv and wherever podcasts are aggregated, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   Now everybody get back to work because break time.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:48.040]   Oh, I forgot to thank our fine studio audience, Matthew Seth and his and Matthew, what school
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.560]   are you guys from again?
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.560]   Kimball High School.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.560]   Where's that located?
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.800]   Tracy, California.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.120]   They were engaged.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.120]   They were involved.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   They were watching.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.120]   Only a few of them fell asleep.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120]   I was very impressed.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120]   They were on the stage.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.440]   And they didn't storm the stage.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.440]   Thank you for being here.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.440]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.440]   You still have 30 seconds left.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.240]   It's not over, is it?
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.240]   It could happen.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.240]   Thank you for joining us now.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.240]   Get back to work.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.760]   Break time is over.

[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.340]   (upbeat rock music)
