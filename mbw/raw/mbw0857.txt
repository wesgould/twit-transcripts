[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.480]   He's here. Hi, how you doing? I'm the problem. It's me. Honestly, it's great to be here. I haven't
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.720]   been here since my first show as a regular. Quite frankly, I should be here more often.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.400]   You live like just lazy next door. It's like a half an hour.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   Oh, I need to get out of my garage. Thank you for giving me an excuse to go outside.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   But how's your dog? Is Maisie going to be all right? She's, you know, she we leave her
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   for a few hours at a time and she can handle it. I don't want to be okay.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.760]   Part of it. She'll be okay. I've separated her from the cats.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.640]   I don't want to create anxiety or anything. The cats will beat her up.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.440]   Jason wrote a shortcut to insert stuff right into our show notes.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.720]   As a result, you have doubled, which thank you. I thank you.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.760]   Doubled the number of things in the show. Andy put a lot of stuff in there too.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.920]   We were pacing over each other. Oh, was being bang, boom, boom, boom.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.280]   We're trying to help because we have to pitch in, Leo. We all have to pitch in these times.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:32.880]   Of a famine news famine news famine. That's Andy and I go W.G. B.H.'s answer to, I don't know,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.560]   question each, each new story according to his need, each new story according to his.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.920]   I was going to say Cliff Clay, whatever. Did that work?
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.280]   I wouldn't really like that. That's why I stopped.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880]   You're the head of the show, but I mean, I will keep going.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.240]   I am loyal, but he's like a correct click-clape.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.880]   I think he's G.B.H.'s answer to you, I think technically.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   That's actually the answer.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.280]   You know who's really Cliff Clay is. I have a number of trouble.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.880]   I have a number of trouble. I have a number of trouble.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.400]   Yes. Very confident.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.200]   Confidently wrong.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.320]   Hello.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.880]   Good to see you.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.000]   Jason, if you consider double dipping, you can start driving for DoorDash.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.960]   And so every time I'm like, "Twit phones in their lunch order,"
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.880]   you could be the one who picks it up and drives it in.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   Yeah, if you guys need anything from Marin County,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.280]   just let me know before I get here and I'll bring it up.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   Just pick it up on the mic.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.400]   We imported this from Marin County.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.200]   So we need to go to Donut Alley, bring in some Donuts and Larkspur.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.240]   I can do that, sure.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.720]   I want you to bring Ben Aff. He is dunking at us.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.040]   Wait a minute, before I do that, let's say hello to Alex, Lindsay.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.640]   Pittsburgh Steelers fan and mainmensch@officehours.global,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.880]   090.media for his day job.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.200]   I liked the Ben Affleck.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.480]   In fact, I went and it worked because it made me go to YouTube
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   and watch all the other outtakes.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.200]   I've been pretending to be a dunking employee.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.840]   It was funny.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.480]   I think it's funny how many ads now are...
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.280]   They put a bunch of other ads or longer versions of all the ads on YouTube.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.960]   Yeah, because $7 million for half a minute of the Super Bowl.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.440]   So they make a five minute ad and they keep the rest for...
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.200]   And if they can drive you to YouTube, I think that that's like a big win.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's way stickier.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   Yeah, it's a huge win.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.200]   We've reached the point where I can no longer tell the difference
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.120]   between real Super Bowl ads and parody Super Bowl ads.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.400]   Because they ran the Netflix ad for that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck movie,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720]   which is about Nike signing Michael Jordan and starting the Air Jordan shoes.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.160]   That's going to be a good movie.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.600]   Well, yeah, but I sat there for the entire run of that ad thinking,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480]   this is a parody, right?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.200]   This is a joke, right?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   This isn't a real movie, right?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.520]   And then as it was going, I'm like, "I guess it really is a movie,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.800]   but I can't tell anymore."
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.320]   I guess that's a movie.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.440]   No, my thing is now that they're so desperate
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.600]   that it used to be enough to air the ads,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.760]   then it used to be enough to put them on YouTube a few days or a week before.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.480]   Now, like a month before, I'm seeing a really stupid news story of what seems like
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.680]   a manufactured controversy about M&Ms and I'm like, "Wait a minute.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   They're setting up some stupid, real marketing thing for..."
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   But immediately I'm like, "I refuse to click on any of these links in my news feed.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.040]   I refuse to use anything like this.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.200]   This is clearly them trying to manipulate me,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.680]   and I will not be manipulated by these specific people on this specific occasion."
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.560]   That one, I was amazed at because we've talked about this.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.280]   I mean, in what I do, we've talked about the idea of building one month,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   two month build-ups to a Superbowl ad for years.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.840]   And no one's really done it very well.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.680]   And this one, I don't think was perfect,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.280]   but it's gotten the closest that I've seen where you're setting something up for...
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.720]   And we were talking about then you use Instagram and YouTube and Twitter
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.640]   and all these things to build up towards something,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.280]   and then you fade it out and do something else for the next one.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.000]   But I thought that when I saw the ad at first, I was like, "What are they doing?"
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.280]   And then I was like, "Same with Andy."
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.400]   I was like, "Oh, I get it."
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.080]   You know what we didn't see on Sunday?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.920]   Any crypto ads?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.800]   Strange.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.880]   You know, the story happened?
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.080]   The irony was so thick, though.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   I mean, the FTX, in my opinion, the FTX ad from last year,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.640]   the year before last year.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.120]   Great ad.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.080]   The best ad of it.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   My favorite ad, other than maybe the Apple ad,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   is my favorite ad ever is the Larry David one.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.200]   The two and a half minute version on YouTube.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.840]   That one drove it.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.240]   That one drove it.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   YouTube, didn't it?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   Oh, it was like a 30 second ad was good,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.080]   but the full ad was just hilarious.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   And the fact that the whole ad is about FTX is going to be fine.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.600]   You know, like it's just normal, like the wheel or like other things like that.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.680]   It turns out that, and then I realized there.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   Ah, there he is saying, "Yeah."
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.040]   Here's the best part.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   They're suing Larry David for the money.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.080]   Right.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.840]   Except here's what his lawyers are going to say.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   Except that in the commercial, he told you.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.720]   He told you that.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.600]   I don't think it's going to work.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   He was right.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.200]   Who knew?
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.000]   So there was only, there were only two QR codes in the Super Bowl.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.520]   What are more than that?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.160]   I saw more.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.040]   This year, there were two.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.960]   No, I think there are more.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.240]   There was marketing daily says there was limit break in Michelobultra.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.920]   Well, the problem is that you also have people buy ads at local markets.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.880]   Oh, you sell local ads.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.760]   And they're all right.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.360]   And so it's hard to get an exact name.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.480]   Right. This is in the national scope of things.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.240]   I got the, my brother has a, my brother runs, the family has a golf course.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.360]   He runs the golf course.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   And you can buy cable ads locally.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   And they just kind of randomly get inserted sometimes, you know, into these things.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.160]   And he had one of the ads for his golf course inserted into the Super Bowl.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.040]   And, and he said that the phone started ringing.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.880]   Like, you know, it was there, the phone was like, and it was just ringing.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.320]   It was every time you put it down.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.680]   Like he said, if you don't think advertising works, he goes, I've never.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.560]   And that was a local.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.480]   That wasn't a even that was a local ad.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.240]   And he said, every time I put the phone down, it just rang.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.920]   And he just watched the point, just picking it up.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.440]   You know, I think maybe the last great national place we all can watch at the same time, right?
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.480]   It shows us why sports rights are valuable too.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.240]   Like this is why sports rights.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.400]   Notice why everybody overpay is for those who are those who
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.880]   sponsor the pregame show was YouTube to promote the fact that they have Sunday ticket.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.480]   And they had a good ad too, which was very simple, which was, you know, how to watch YouTube,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.520]   then you can get you don't have to put a satellite dish on your roof anymore.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   You can get NFL Sunday ticket.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.760]   That was the big one.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.000]   Right.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.360]   You don't need a satellite anymore.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.640]   And I watched it.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.160]   I watched the game through YouTube TV and I thought it looked great.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.760]   Yeah, they had 4K, didn't they?
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.320]   Fox.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.960]   Yeah, they did.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.120]   I've scaled 1080p, but still looks better.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.040]   Well, the HDR actually really tell the color, the color and the bright whites.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   It looks really great.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.360]   And I think it would actually throw my TV out actually.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.320]   That's right.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.200]   It's a shame.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   It's a very expensive Super Bowl for you.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.440]   I think it was.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.800]   After that, I think it actually got better TV.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.440]   I think it actually is 4K all the way through.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   On this one.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.560]   Well, you know, when your phone is actually technically the best screen in the house.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.240]   That's a bad sign.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.640]   Is that so stupid?
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.360]   It probably is.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.280]   My iPad Pro screen is truly the best screen in the house.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   I've been doing it.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.880]   I've been accurate.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   Exactly.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.240]   I've been using it.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.120]   I have not terrible screens, like big screens hooked up to my desktops here.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.000]   But only when I use my iPad Pro as an external display is when I realize that,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.520]   oh, maybe I should be dragging my Photoshop window into there.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.560]   And just using the big 27 inch screen just for palettes and stuff.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.680]   Does anybody remember?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.360]   So one of the two QR codes nationally was something called Limit Break.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.560]   Does anybody remember that ad?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   Do you remember what they were do offering with the QR code?
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.120]   Scan for access to an NFT.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.000]   Promoting a game called Digi.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.400]   But it wasn't.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   But it wasn't.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   Digi.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.760]   G-U-Koo.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.560]   Boy.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.000]   So here's the funny thing.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.880]   Wait a second million.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.840]   I build QR codes a lot.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.920]   So anytime someone puts a QR code up, I go to it because I want to see what it does and how it works.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.960]   And everything else.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   And that one actually went to the Twitter account.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.040]   At least when I did it, it went to the Twitter account of the CEO of the company
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.880]   that see if it does it for you.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.720]   But it could be changed over time.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.480]   Because it's to the Twitter.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.240]   And how many followers does he have?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.760]   And he says, "Follow to win."
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.880]   And he has 1 million followers now.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.600]   So that worked.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.000]   When I hit it, he had about 800,000.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.840]   So he added like 150,000 yesterday.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.200]   And maybe he was less than that at the beginning of the day.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.680]   But the M. So there was that.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.920]   There was the animal control had one.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.640]   You know, because he just talked the whole time about animal.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.400]   You know, the actor talked about that.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.000]   I know that there were more.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.400]   There was.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.880]   There was.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.160]   I saw at least three or four of them.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:24.960]   That's okay.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.480]   Maybe marketing daily missed it.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.040]   It's a tricky thing to do to do QR codes in 30 seconds because you have to persuade.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.680]   Don't you tell people not to scan QR codes at random?
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.800]   Is that risky or no?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.920]   I think you will trust it at a, if they're told it's $7 million.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   It's in the super poll.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.840]   People that checked it.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.640]   There's probably some agreements about what that QR code can do.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.320]   I wouldn't worry about it as much there as I would other places.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.360]   But it also means that there's a certain amount of desperation to harvest as much data,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.560]   valuable, resolable data as possible to offset the cost of that.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.280]   No kidding.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.440]   It's it may be harvesting the data or just in the case of the Twitter account,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.800]   harvesting just people that are you're going to you're going to get to come back to again.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.680]   So he's now got another 200,000 people that he can at least reach.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.560]   You know, after the ad, you make that impression, but you don't remember.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.320]   Like there was there was another one that I saw that.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.560]   Oh, we were excited because Mr. Beast was on in one of the ads, the one with the flag football.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.880]   Oh, Mr. Beast was in that?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.640]   There were a lot of people in that ad you might have missed.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   There were a lot of people in it, but but but Jimmy's in it right when he goes, he goes,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.080]   the Mr. Beast is there when she runs by and he goes, I missed it.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.400]   You know, and he's that's that's Mr. Beast.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.720]   So anyway, but all of us remember that Mr. Beast was in it, but none of us could remember what the
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.280]   ad was about.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.880]   It was flag football.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.360]   That was just basically a PSA.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.160]   It was a PSA.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.920]   Because it's the fastest growing girls sport in America, I think.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.480]   Yeah, I don't really.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.600]   Was it the flag manufacturers of America?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.640]   Yeah, it was the NFL.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.200]   Who's the NFL?
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.960]   It's the NFL because they want to put you in.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.920]   It's like PRA.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.120]   Because the provo was flag football.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.000]   Yeah, they're promoting.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.960]   Because you know what?
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.120]   They realize at some point the NFL may be flag football too.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.280]   It's going to have to be because it's dangerous.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.840]   I think the other thing is a huge part of people who watch football are people who used to play
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.680]   football. And so if more women play football, then they're going to more likely to watch football.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.120]   You know, even if they're not not playing the contact version.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.240]   They're a marketing wizard.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.600]   The expiration of football players.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.160]   Right.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.120]   Watch out, pickleball.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.200]   Pickleball's next.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.320]   You said the word.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.640]   I won't play game football.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.240]   That's the sport of the future.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.600]   It is the sport of the now for people over a stage.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   That's a kickboxing, Jason.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.200]   I think you're going to work kickboxing for the future.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   Thank you.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.200]   All right.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.800]   Stories about Apple.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.520]   Okay.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.760]   Did you get the update?
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.320]   You should.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.680]   All of the stuff, all of the stuff was updated.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.920]   Mac OS, iOS, iPad OS.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.800]   I don't know if TVOS and watch OS were to.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.000]   But it was a web kit of serious web kit flaw.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.760]   This is the the CVE for Mac OS Ventura 13.2.1.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.840]   Just came out, I think yesterday.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.000]   Impact.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.360]   There's a web kit flaw processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   arbitrary code execution.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.880]   Apple is and this is the worst part aware of a report that this issue may have been actively
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.840]   exploited.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.920]   In other words, a zero day web kit, that's about as bad as you can get.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.960]   That means you go to a website and it's maliciously crafted and they own your thing.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.800]   So.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.480]   Your Apple device.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.640]   Your Apple device is what I was going to say.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   Thank you very much.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.880]   It also is an important fix for those who are having some library
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.400]   shoes with Final Cut Pro.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.120]   There's some fixes that are hidden in there that a lot of folks on the Twitter
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.280]  verse have been talking about that that it fixes some problems that we've been having with
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.560]   big libraries and some external, external plugins that have had some issues.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:12.080]   iOS 16.3.1 as well as iPad OS 16.3.1 and Safari is updated on the older versions of Mac OS to
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.800]   support this.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.480]   I guess TVOS went to 16.3.2.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.960]   Watch OS 9.3.1.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.760]   All of that yesterday.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.160]   Happy Valentine's Day for Mac OS.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.440]   So I think though, the point being do it.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.160]   Except if you're using Google Photos, then maybe don't do it.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.400]   Actually, I've had, you know, I thought, oh my God, and I, because I had updated everything,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.320]   I went to Google Photos, everything seems to be running.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.640]   I don't know if Google fixed its photos app or something happened.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.440]   Have you tried?
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.920]   I haven't.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.800]   Try on your iPhone.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.480]   Somebody just supposedly crashes Google Photos.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.840]   If you're Google, this is not a fun fact.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.760]   The first one Google Photos is now available.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.880]   So I guess Google and push their own update to fix it.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.440]   They push an update to fix it.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.320]   Okay.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.760]   So if you have that problem, I don't know why I actually swallowed the fly.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.680]   You just keep updating things to update other things to update other things to stop all the crashes.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.240]   That's good because otherwise Tim Cook might have been in the awful position of
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.680]   once again having to say when people complain about that we'd really like to see
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.000]   you move all those Google Photos over Apple Photos.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.200]   I didn't have the problem to begin with, and I do have the updated now Google Photos,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.560]   and I still don't have the problem.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.680]   So that's good all around.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.000]   Great.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.640]   That's right.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.040]   We don't know.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.960]   Google has it said they did put out a fix, but they haven't said what to fix.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.000]   I knew we shouldn't have used that WebKit Zero Day flaw.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.080]   Oh, you know, it could be, couldn't it?
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.200]   It says it is.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.080]   I'm sure Google Photos has to use WebKit to render.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.480]   We shouldn't have had chat, GPT render our, create our code for creating for updating the
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.040]   Google Photos.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.760]   That was just a mistake.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:49.920]   Damn it.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.640]   That was a known goal.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.040]   Damn it.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.760]   Apple has gotten better at releasing these security based software updates faster.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.360]   They seem to be, well, especially when it's a zero day, that's important.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.560]   They had reports that it was being exploited.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.920]   And that sounds to me, generally that sounds like a zero click exploit because
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.480]   it's a web page, WebKit renders it.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.560]   They have now rooted your device.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   That's pretty bad.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.680]   So something to be aware of here.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.880]   And I guess it's safe to update to 1631 if you are a Google Photos user now.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.960]   Just get the latest Google Photos as well.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.080]   Well, that's our show.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.400]   Thank you.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.840]   Thank you for joining.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.400]   And great to see you.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:30.960]   No, there's others.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.000]   There's other news.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.600]   It's mostly, you know, rumor like, how about this?
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.680]   Mark Gurman says the 15 and a half inch MacBook Air is a common next month or April,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.720]   I guess, early April.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   Is that next month?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.120]   Mark, April?
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.080]   No, two months from now.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.560]   Was this?
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.880]   I think this was Ross Young, the one to display analyst actually.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.160]   Oh, was it not Gurman?
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.120]   And he knows because he knows that they're making the panel, right?
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   He knows the specs of the panel that's being manufactured for the display.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.480]   And that's the giveaway, right?
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.280]   Is they know it's not a MacBook Pro display.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.640]   They know it's not an iPad display.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   It's a MacBook Air display, but it's in this larger size 15, what?
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.160]   Point five, 15.3.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.120]   It's a, it's like a large, they're basically going to do a large print edition
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.640]   of the MacBook Air.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.040]   And I think that's great because right now if you want a bigger
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.240]   than MacBook Air screen on a Mac laptop, you got to pay two grand.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.960]   This is strange from Apple Insider.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.360]   The new MacBook Air might also receive a Mag 3 connector for charging as opposed to charging
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.760]   via USB-C port, but the M2 MacBook Air has a Mag 6.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.280]   Yes, it already does.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.080]   So are they confused?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.720]   They are confused.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.400]   I see that a lot where people forget that the M2 MacBook Air exists
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.840]   because they are still selling them.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.560]   The M1 MacBook Air, but I assume this is going to look like the M2
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.200]   MacBook Air.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   It's an M2 with, and now this can't possibly be an M3?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.280]   No, no, somebody says a 3 nanometer maybe.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.800]   No, it's just going to be literally like the one that I've got here.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.360]   Only bigger.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.240]   M2 Air, only bigger so that you can get more screen.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.120]   And otherwise I imagine the specs would be exactly the same.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.680]   The dots print will stay the same too.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.480]   I think so.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.400]   When you said the large print edition,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.520]   a scared me like,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.280]   I imagine it'll have more resolution than this display.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.200]   I remember reading the old iBook.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.760]   Do you remember that?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.800]   There was the large iBook that had the literally same pixel count
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.280]   as the smaller iBook?
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.000]   That would be bad.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.160]   That would be bad, but I don't think that's what's going to be here.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.960]   I think this idea here is that everything else is the same,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.080]   but it's got a screen with more pixels and more size.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.680]   So because, you know, not everybody likes a 13-inch display.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.720]   So having a 15-plus-inch display is a great option.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.800]   So this was Ross Young in Ace.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.160]   Tweet to super followers.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.520]   I don't understand Twitter anymore, so I don't know what that means.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.600]   It's like a newsletter, but on Twitter.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.400]   But you pay for it.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.760]   So he's on the supply chain, and he knows that,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.000]   in fact, he said that this would happen last year.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.440]   He said it would happen in the spring.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   And then he said in his tweet to super followers,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.760]   they're making them.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.880]   That they're actually manufacturing started this month,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.080]   product launching in April.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.960]   That's not about right.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.320]   And it's a pretty clever way of figuring out what a company that doesn't
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.680]   pre-announce its products is doing is looking at the supply chain and saying,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.720]   this thing has to be for a big MacBook Air,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   and they just started rolling them off the assembly line.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.160]   And we know from Tim Cook, right?
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.720]   Like Tim Cook is not somebody who stores boxes full of tens of thousands of parts.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.680]   If they're making it.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.640]   Somewhere.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Those are going just in time to an Apple factory
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.920]   where they're being assembled together,
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.760]   because that's how Apple makes products.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.360]   Ming Chico had said last year that there would be a 15-inch in late 2023.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.840]   It would be called a MacBook instead of a MacBook Air.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.720]   I mean, maybe.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.280]   That's marketing.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.240]   I guess it's still possible.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.880]   It's just a name.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.640]   They don't even put the name on it anymore, right?
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.480]   There's no name on yours?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:42.960]   I don't think so.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.520]   Underneath?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   No.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   No.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.120]   There's no more etched.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   No.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.760]   There's nothing on the pros there are, but not on the MacBook Air.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.200]   Yeah, they could call it MacBook or whatever.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.360]   They want a MacBook Studio or MacBook.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:53.920]   Something else.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.400]   They can make it.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.440]   What do you all think of the rumor that that's the last Mac Studio,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.600]   that that was just an interim product,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.760]   and that they're never going to make another one again?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.640]   I hope not.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.600]   That would be very surprising.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.720]   I thought the Mac Studio was an...
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.040]   I did about two, one for me and was released.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.560]   I thought it was a very nice machine.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.640]   I believe the speculation that it might be in every other
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.800]   with the Mac Pro, that they'll do a Mac Studio,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.480]   every other generation and a Mac Pro.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.960]   If you have a Mac Pro and a Mac Studio,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   there's kind of overlap in the line.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.520]   The Mac Pro is going to be way more expensive though.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.600]   I think that there is a...
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.240]   It does seem like there's an overlap.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.840]   You know, where there's the iPad, the Mac Mini Pro,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.600]   overlaps the studio but doesn't have the fan
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.000]   and doesn't have some of the I/O.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.640]   And I don't think that's going to change in that form factor.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.680]   That's the Mini though.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   And then there's the Mini.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.240]   There's the Mini.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.960]   Then you have the Studio.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.240]   Then you have the Studio with the Chantio.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.200]   Then you have the Chantio.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.600]   And a big fan, which makes a big difference on more extended production.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.360]   And then you would have the Pro.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   And I think the thing the Pro adds is external cards,
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   more modularity, those types of things will most likely be what we see under the Pro.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.440]   So I think that there is...
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.520]   I think there's a space for all of those for the Mac Mini.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   It's like the Mac Break Weekly panel.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   You're the Pro, Jason's the studio, and I'm sorry, Andy, but you're the Mini.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.960]   Mini Pro.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   Mini Pro.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.560]   Not Mini.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.040]   Mini.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.000]   Mini Pro.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.640]   Let's be fair.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.360]   Okay.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.440]   Let's upgrade from Clavin.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.840]   No, I'm just thinking you're the natural purchaser of the Mini Pro, I would say.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.320]   Yes.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.680]   And I mean, now as the natural purchaser of the studio, I'm leaving myself out of this.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.440]   I'm going to get an etch a sketch.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:41.200]   And then Alex, clearly, if anybody's good by the Pro, it'd be you, Mr. Lindsey.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   I just...
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.560]   The only reason I bought the studio is because I didn't know when the Pro would come out,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.960]   which I'm glad I did, because I was waiting for the Pro.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.240]   I think there's a distinct audience for the studio, so I hope it doesn't go away.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   I'd love the studio.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.240]   I would not buy a Mac Pro, right?
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.640]   No, no, no.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.720]   I'm never going to do that, but I just shell out for the more powerful studio,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.160]   and I can fit that in my life.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.720]   But the studio's overkill anyway for most of us.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   Yeah, I mean, well, honestly, even the high end Mini is probably overkill for most of us.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   The M2 MacBook Air is probably overkill for most of us.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.640]   That's where we are now.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.240]   But certainly that studio...
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.680]   Well, I didn't buy the Ultra, right?
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.040]   Like, I bought the Mac's version of the studio too, because that was...
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.120]   I get Lisa the Ultra, because she says, "I have to have the fastest."
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.640]   And I said, "Okay, you'll get the Ultra.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.520]   You'll never..."
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   Not in the headroom for you.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.600]   But if you want it, you got it, and I got the Pro.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.720]   Yeah, I just think some people are not going to buy a giant tower, and they...
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.360]   It's perfect.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.000]   So why would you...
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.520]   At first we thought it was a little fat.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.680]   You know, because it's a tall Mini, but it's just kind of sweet.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.320]   It's a nice...
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.280]   It's a good fit.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.720]   The signature of the studio could literally be that it's double high,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.000]   and it's got a super aggressive cooling.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.680]   So if you imagine a future Apple Silicon
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.280]   that is going to be suitable for people who not necessarily in the market for a Mac Pro,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.680]   but they want, as you say, all that headroom,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   and let's make this super, super fast.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.640]   And now we can't make this work inside the Mac Mini form factor,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.120]   but if we put this huge nuclear power plant cooling tower on top of it,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.560]   yes, we can get this...
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.480]   Design this chip that will fit inside that Mini desktop form factor.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.200]   I think that we're going to see more of a differentiation
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.160]   with the introduction of new CPUs in the future.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.640]   And again, even if you could get almost to the same power with the Mac,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   the Mini Pro, it is much better to get the studio at the same price,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.040]   because of the heat dissipation, the more I know that my studio,
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.320]   all the I/O is full all the time.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   Like with my Mac studio, I could use more at that point.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.920]   Jason says they should have made it a cube.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.480]   Yeah, I mean, the only way the Vex studio could be improved
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   is if they just made it taller and called it the M1.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:48.960]   So close.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.520]   CUBE.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.000]   So close.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.040]   CUBE's are best.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.600]   Right.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   What if they just took the case buildings for the Mac G4
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   and basically made it into a cluster?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   So basically, you can put them in a toast.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.120]   You can stack them in like slices of bread in a bread bag.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.920]   And basically, they find each other, they multi-th...
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.680]   And once they find themselves in the same container...
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.560]   Let's start a rumor.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.600]   Let's do it.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.520]   Let's start a rumor that that's the next Mac Pro.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.560]   No, no, no, no, right behind him.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.040]   There it is.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.680]   We got to put in the newsletter.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.720]   We got to put in the newsletter.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.840]   I loved that cube.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.480]   I loved the cube.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.440]   That was a great thing.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:21.920]   Yep.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.440]   But it was plastic right now.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.040]   You could do it with aluminum.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.000]   They had a crunchy metal shell or interior.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.040]   Yeah, inside.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.520]   In-terior.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.360]   But the plastic on the outside, that's true.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.840]   That's true.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.040]   They do it all aluminum now.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.240]   But it's squirt if you bit into it.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.840]   No, I mean, you do blood with squirt out if you bit into it.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.640]   That's what would happen.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:38.960]   Okay.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.760]   Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.240]   That's a...
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.880]   Moving on.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.000]   Actually, it had a...
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.560]   Good.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.920]   It's the studio the best Mac for most...
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.120]   desktop.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.880]   Oh, desktop for people.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.360]   I mean, for...
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.400]   No.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.880]   I think the MacBook Air only for the average of the best Mac.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.120]   Right?
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.160]   That's the best Mac.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   I think so.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.160]   It's only the best seller.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:58.880]   The Air.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.840]   You got the M2 Air.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.320]   I don't know.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.400]   I mean, I think I could argue that the iMac
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.240]   is the best desktop Mac for people.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.720]   Because most people don't need more even than an M1.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.240]   And it comes with its own display.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.280]   And it's really nice.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:09.920]   Small though.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.960]   It comes in colors.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.040]   Yeah, but most people need more than a 24-inch display.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.880]   Do normal people like 24-inch displays?
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.440]   Is that normal?
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:17.920]   I don't know.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.560]   Let's ask them.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.360]   Can you find some?
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.320]   We're not here.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.800]   Anybody?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.000]   Mueller?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.480]   Anybody?
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.000]   Right.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.520]   For mainstream, for regular use.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.600]   And when you talk to Apple about how that iMac gets used,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.080]   it is.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:34.320]   Like, in schools and in families and at hotel lobbies
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.760]   and all sorts of weird places where it is.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.640]   But it's just sort of like,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.960]   "Hey, I just need a computer on a desk.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.000]   Can you get me that?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.520]   I don't want to plug in a display.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.400]   I don't want to do any of that.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.800]   I just...
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.440]   Can you do that?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.200]   And that even today,
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.360]   that M1 iMac is going to do everything.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.840]   They need.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.240]   And they don't do a 27 because it would be more expensive.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.040]   People not want bigger screens?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.120]   Apple seems to have come to the opinion that the 27 people
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.360]   who are buying a 27-inch display
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.200]   should probably buy an external display
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.560]   and then attach a computer to it.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.520]   And a Mac Mini.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.880]   Which would cost like a lot of money, right?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.920]   That's 1,500 plus whatever, 800 or 900.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.480]   That would be more than a 27-inch iMac.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   Although you could then replace the computer
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.480]   a few years down the road and keep the display.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.880]   I mean, I think that that's kind of one of the advantages
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.960]   is that I know that for this in Rwanda,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.080]   when we first built a school,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.360]   we built them all with iMacs.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.440]   And the real problem we had is anytime you had to fix them,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.480]   it was like expensive and cumbersome and everything else.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.440]   They're pretty, but not bad.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.960]   We're looking at getting another set of them
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.080]   and they're all going to be Mac Mini's.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   They're like the poodles of computers.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.200]   Yeah, so I think they're not practical.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.920]   I'd much rather not pay for the screen once
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.240]   or be able to replace the screen or that type of thing.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.400]   Jason got his home pods.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.560]   I did Gen 2.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.960]   I had Sonos 1, an original home pod, a new home pod,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   and a home pod Mini all lined up in a row.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.040]   Oh!
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.600]   Stereo pairs.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.480]   Does he have a sound?
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.080]   Mind up in both sides of my office.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.360]   Oh, you did a test.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.120]   I did the whole thing.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.920]   And the answer is the problem is not how they sound.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.360]   Okay.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.160]   What's the problem?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   The problem is everything else.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.560]   The problem is that AirPlay is not reliable,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.400]   that Siri is not reliable,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.200]   and that the stereo pair system that they built is not reliable.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.680]   Oh, I know.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.640]   That's disappointing.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.120]   So, you know, in the end, would I recommend home pods
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   to my friends who are super techy and care about sound?
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.840]   Yes, because they sound good.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.720]   They sound really good.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.200]   They sound about the same as the old ones.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.320]   They're not the same.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.280]   They sound different, but...
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.560]   They're fewer tweeters.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.680]   Yeah, although the...
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.280]   Actually, the high end actually sounds,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.440]   I think, more clear than in the first generation.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.680]   It's a little less bassy than the first generation.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.640]   But in the end, if somebody snuck into your house
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.880]   and swapped the old ones out for the new ones,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.160]   most people would never notice.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.680]   They look the same, essentially.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.040]   They sound ish.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.520]   Same ish, not the same, but same ish.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.560]   The problem is that, you know, in all of my testing
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.600]   of all these things, I kept on having like one of them
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.560]   didn't play.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.360]   Oh.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.680]   But it was still on, and it would still respond
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.400]   to the sounds.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.680]   They were stereo pairs, but only...
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.360]   Stereo play, only one plays.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.480]   I press pause.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.000]   I play it again now to play.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.560]   Then I pause, then I play it again, now one play.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.000]   And I tested it on Mac.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.440]   I tested it on AirPlay from an iPad, from an iPhone.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.880]   I tried it right on the device.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.080]   Just super, super unreliable.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   The old one wasn't particularly reliable either.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.880]   This isn't new.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.960]   This has been a problem with the HomePod stuff
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.080]   from the beginning.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.240]   Siri, you know, people like to beat up on Siri.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480]   The problem with Siri is not that it can't be good.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   It's that it's not reliable.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.880]   That sometimes I get answers back from Siri almost immediately,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.960]   or it'll play something almost immediately.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.200]   And then other times, it just spins forever.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   Doesn't understand me, doesn't know what to do,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.960]   or identifies what I want to play,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.320]   and then hands it off to Apple Music,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.800]   and Apple Music just sort of doesn't play it.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.520]   So I think it's just a fundamental problem
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.800]   with Apple's whole kind of smart home infrastructure here,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   that they've made a really good sounding speaker.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.160]   But like, it's just, I would never inflict this on
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.640]   one of my friends who's not in the tech industry,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.240]   who's just like, "Hey, Jason, I'm looking for
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.600]   some smart speakers. What should I get?"
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.480]   And I'm like, "I could never recommend
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.920]   the Mysterio pair of HomePods."
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.400]   Interesting.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   Now my Apple TV is always saying,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   "Come on, you want to use those HomePods for speakers?"
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.800]   Right?
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.920]   I say, "No, I have speakers."
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.880]   But keep saying it, is it a good choice for a TV?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.560]   Apple TV?
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.160]   I mean, maybe?
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.800]   Do you try that?
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.360]   Maybe?
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.800]   I haven't tried that a little while.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.400]   That would be annoying if the sound didn't.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   The problem is, yeah, the problem is,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.720]   when the Apple TV is driving the stereo pair,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.000]   is it reliable or not?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.960]   Right.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.280]   And then the other challenge is like--
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.160]   Is it laggy?
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.880]   You're bothering me.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.360]   I'm worried.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.800]   You're setting up a stereo pair.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   You're getting a stereo out.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.120]   Like, I have a 5.1 system.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.240]   Like, you get the center channel.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.600]   I really like having the center channel.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.640]   But you could do it.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.160]   I mean, there's some options there.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.680]   If you're playing video games,
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.280]   you shouldn't do it because you're going to,
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.520]   even though it will route your audio from your TV
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.080]   back into the Apple TV and out to the HomePods,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.000]   you're going to introduce some lag there.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   I wouldn't recommend that.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.200]   Yeah, Bluetooth is a little bit lag-y.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.520]   Maybe doing Wi-Fi direct.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.760]   I don't even know exactly what it's doing there.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.320]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.680]   Anyway, they sound good,
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.520]   but I feel like everybody who writes about
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.040]   how they sound is kind of missing the fact
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.240]   that they're just not reliable.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.040]   Now, come to think of it.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.640]   My minis, everyone's well, one of the channels.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   Right.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.200]   I mean, they've had these products out there
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.720]   for like five years now,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.480]   and the stereo pair stuff still is--
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.120]   Same thing.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.920]   It just--
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.200]   Yeah, sometimes I will--
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.000]   Over the years, since--
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.440]   Because I've had a HomePods since the beginning,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.120]   and a stereo pair in my house,
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.960]   I will say, why do they sound so weird?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.720]   And it's almost always because one of them
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.960]   has just stopped playing audio
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.800]   until I unplug them both,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.680]   plug them back in,
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.600]   and then usually it'll come back.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.440]   But it just happens.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.640]   They're not unplugged.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.080]   They're still on the network.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.200]   They're still visible.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.960]   It still thinks it's a stereo pair.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.200]   But one of them just is like,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.480]   yeah, I'm taking it to the day off.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.440]   It might be hard to do.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.080]   It might be hard to do.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.040]   I think it is hard to do.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.160]   I mean, other speakers do--
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.680]   Other speakers do a better job of it?
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.120]   I think Sonos' stuff does a better job of it,
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.720]   and it's more reliable, yeah.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.400]   I've admitted I'm so bitter about the way
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.760]   the Sonos handled their amp,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.720]   which I have a lot of.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.560]   That I just--
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.240]   Abandoned it, yeah.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   You know, like I just--
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.880]   I was like, okay, I'll--
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.600]   Did you push this review yesterday on sixcolors.com?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.720]   They did do an update yesterday on the HomePods, so--
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.120]   Yeah, but I think that was the security update.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.880]   I was updated to the latest versions.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.000]   I don't think that this problem
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   that's been outstanding for all this time
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.680]   suddenly got fixed yesterday.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.560]   Mine come tomorrow.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.880]   I did update it to last week's updates.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.360]   I should have read the review.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.320]   Before I put it.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.400]   And, you know, if it works--
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.080]   Well, yeah, but you know about troubleshooting.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.120]   I think that's what I came back to.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.960]   It's like conventional computer troubleshooting stuff
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.000]   can handle a lot of this.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.400]   You can't say, okay, I recognize there's a problem here.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.120]   I'm going to restart.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.320]   I'm going to do a home kit update.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.680]   I'm going to unplug and re-plug them.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   You're so right on, because Lisa will get just--
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.240]   It doesn't work.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.880]   It doesn't work.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.520]   It doesn't work.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.960]   And I said, well, you have to--
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.280]   It works, but you have to do this and this and this and this
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.080]   and it'll work.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.960]   So I'm not going to do--
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.440]   I don't know.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.720]   What are you talking about?
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   If my friend Sean from down the blocks to Jason,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.680]   I want some smart speakers.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.720]   I'm not going to recommend it.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   I'm going to say, are you sure you want smart speakers?
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.920]   And even if you know how to fix it,
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.440]   it's kind of annoying that you have to fix it.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.720]   Right?
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.520]   So it's not even--
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.160]   It's very annoying.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.160]   And it's just an airplane.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.760]   I don't want to just say it's the stereo pair,
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.800]   because it's not just that.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.040]   It's like, AirPlay 2 is not really reliable.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.840]   I do air-playing music in my office every day.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.480]   And like, even there, it sometimes a track finishes
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.840]   and the next track starts to play.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.960]   And no music comes out.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.360]   And Apple Music thinks it's playing music,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.480]   but no music is playing.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.840]   And if I go to the next track, then the music starts playing again.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.120]   And that's just AirPlay 2.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.320]   So I don't know.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.120]   I don't know what to say.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.840]   They're all little.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.960]   I mean, I have in my bedroom area, Apple's Siri with Minis.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.760]   I have Google and I have Echo this morning before I was dreaming peacefully.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.280]   And all of a sudden, the Star Wars death march came on loud.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.320]   I don't know which speaker.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   So I just, I'm like, my eyes are closed.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.840]   I go, "Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum!"
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.160]   And I'm shouting, so I shout all three.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.320]   I said, "Shirry, shut up. Echo, shut up.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.440]   Google, shut up."
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.160]   And finally it stopped.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.840]   I don't know who it was or which was playing.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.920]   But it was quite annoying.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.800]   Then I asked Lisa, I said, "Did you just play the Darth Vader's death march in the bedroom?"
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.360]   She said, "No."
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.200]   Maybe the kid did.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.520]   That was just the kind of joke he might try.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.160]   Or could it just have randomly done it or?
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   Were you hacked?
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.640]   I was hacked.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.280]   Did you get hacked?
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.240]   Because that's happened before.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.200]   There's one of, I love them.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.680]   One of our chatters, nice guy.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:50.160]   I had to finally block it with like, "Happy Valentine's Day, Leo!"
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.680]   Through my Echo.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.320]   Oh my God.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.840]   Tapping.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.720]   You know who you are.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.280]   It's okay.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.840]   I liked it.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.360]   I appreciate it, but I did finally kind of say, "Nobody should be able to call me."
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.360]   No drop ins.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.800]   The best luck I've had, like I have some Sonos speakers,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.560]   the Sonos app talking to the Sonos speakers is more reliable than AirPlay.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.640]   I like it that it's the word.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   I like it that it's the word.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.080]   Carlo Espazito.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.200]   Sure, you can do that.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.960]   No, and you can't do it.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.920]   It's his voice.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.040]   That's the Sonos voice.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.480]   And you can't choose it.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:20.880]   It's him.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.400]   I just don't use the voice for Sonos.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.960]   I just use the Sonos app, which isn't very good as the problem,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.240]   but it is reliable.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.120]   And Spotify.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:27.920]   The app works fine.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.120]   The Sonos app also, the Sonos speaker supports Spotify Connect.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.960]   And that's also more reliable.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.080]   So the challenge here for Apple is that I just don't think,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.200]   "Why did they bring it back?"
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.120]   I don't know.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.000]   What were they thinking?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.760]   It sounds good.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.840]   I think internally they believe that their software is more solid than it is.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.560]   I think that's it.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.400]   That's not good.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.640]   Because it's not.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.320]   So would you say, well, no, you said don't.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.840]   You said Steve don't buy it.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.760]   Neighbor Steve don't buy it.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.400]   Right.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.480]   But geek maybe buy it.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.800]   Sure.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.520]   Anybody who is willing to do the, did you unplug it and plug it back in?
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.200]   Anybody who knows those sorts of things?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.760]   Or Lisa.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.960]   You could figure it out.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.080]   Or toggling the airplay or getting it back to the right
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   status on your iPhone where you're playing it to the speakers
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.960]   and not to your own phone or all of that stuff.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.840]   If you get through all of that, you can make it work and it sounds good.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.400]   It does.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.880]   And I have had them for five years.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.160]   It just has one in her office here and one in her office at home.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.520]   I don't think she ever uses it.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   I thought for Valentine's Day, it would be kind of nice to replace the minis
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.240]   with the full size ones.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.960]   So when the cat steps on it, it really blasts out.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.360]   That's good.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.400]   You get the bass response.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.840]   Yeah, I get the bass response.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.040]   Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.160]   That's good.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.320]   It does get really, it does get really tough with,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.400]   with when you're doing streaming to a local speaker over Wi-Fi.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   Every time that I look, I have sometimes have that problem.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.680]   Every time that I look into other people's experiences,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   particularly on professional network administrators, boards,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.040]   because they have all the software and all the tools to like,
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.640]   dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.600]   dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.080]   radio scan.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.520]   They always find that there's something nearby on the network
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.560]   that's interfering with whatever line of communication
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.040]   that is being tried instead of the speaker.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.240]   So really, unless we have an inadequate RF shielded chamber,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.840]   it's really hard to test these things out,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.000]   because all you gotta do is have somebody who has some quirky piece of hardware,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.440]   whether it's a brand new subset system from a competing company,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.200]   or a really, really, really old piece of hardware or old microwave.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.040]   You don't know why it's randomly disconnecting
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.240]   until you upgrade your microwave and then suddenly goes away and you never notice it.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.920]   Should we say just, if you're gonna, if you care about sound,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.760]   you should get wired speakers. Should we say that?
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.840]   Well, there'll be way cheaper.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.520]   There'll be cheaper and they're more live.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.120]   And they don't become obsolete when the technology changes.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.520]   You don't have to get version three of your speakers.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.040]   Or an all-in-one speaker.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.360]   Like there are also stereo speakers.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.120]   Like Sonos makes the Sonos 5 that is not cheap.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.480]   We have all over the studio.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.040]   But it sounds so great and it's all-in-one,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.440]   so it's not gonna, like one of the speakers,
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.800]   one tweeter is not gonna go, "Oh, I've lost the plot."
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.960]   Right? Like, happens with the HomePod.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.160]   So there's a lot to be said to that.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.680]   I still say I get wired, because Sonos is never-
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.480]   the wired, you can get wired speakers that sound way better
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.520]   than any smart speaker on the market for a fraction of the cost.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.400]   Yes, you have to have an amp.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.960]   And the amp and wires and-
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.760]   And wires, no. There are lots of reasons not to.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.320]   But depending on your use case,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.760]   if you just want a stereo pair and you can just put them on,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.080]   you know, two sides of a table with wires.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.240]   I have e-lots speakers everywhere with wires and an amp.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.360]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, that's what I strongly
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.800]   prefer wired for everything.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.840]   Yeah. So I do as little wireless, I do wireless,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.040]   but as little as possible.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.000]   There are here issues.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.880]   Everything that I do in production and home and everything else.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   But I do, you know, it is convenient.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.120]   Like, we grab that, we have the older HomePod,
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.440]   the bigger one, and we take it everywhere in the house.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.160]   Like, we just kind of move it around as needed and set it down.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.800]   It is nice. I will say it's convenient to be able to turn it on
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   and just have it sound good in some room.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.800]   And so there's a-
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.080]   I think that there's definitely a place for both of those.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.960]   But I think that the wired is always going to give you,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.320]   if you're really a fishing auto, you're going to get a wired set of speakers
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.520]   and you might start with stereo.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.360]   And I do wish that the HomePods had some kind of, you know, analog in.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   I know that sounds crazy, rapple, but it would be nice to have like,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.320]   just an eighth of ten.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.080]   For that amount of money, why not have it?
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.880]   Yeah, I have been using, I just stopped last year,
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.800]   but I was using an iPod high-five, I remember that.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.920]   But it has an aux in and it sounds pretty good.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.480]   It doesn't sound as good as the sun knows five, but it sounds pretty good.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.000]   And but it has the aux port in and these things,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.240]   you know, Sonos has some speakers that have that plug in,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.760]   but the Apple stuff, it doesn't.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.880]   So at some point, if it's not supported by software in some way,
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.240]   they're just, they're useless and they're not very reversible
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.080]   because if you've got, if you want to run an input into them, you just can't, you can't do it.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.920]   Yeah, the five is $549.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.880]   Yeah, it was not cheap.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.440]   Speaker.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.160]   Sounds great.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.240]   We have, we have the old moves, which is nice because in the kitchen,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.400]   because the moves are portable.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.840]   So you, they sit on a charging stand, but you, like Alex was saying,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.040]   you could pick them up and they're 100 bucks more than the Apple thing.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.200]   So I don't know, I mean, I don't know if they're better sounding.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.440]   I'll put them.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.320]   I don't think they sound as good, but they're portable.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.640]   They're battery in there, which is nice.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.680]   And they do airplay too.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:49.520]   And they have Giancarlo Esposito is in there, the head of Lóspoio Sermonos.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.680]   He doesn't, he's not very smart.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.800]   He's always saying, I don't know, I don't know what you want, but it's nice because he's in there.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.240]   And I like it.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.960]   And maybe it's better if your smart assistant has that attitude, right?
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   I was like, what, what do you want?
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.480]   What do you want?
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.200]   I'm busy.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.760]   I'm busy.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.120]   Beat it.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.400]   I got an empire to run.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.640]   Let's take a little break.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.160]   That sounds like a Jason problem to me.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.560]   Say their name.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.920]   That was my favorite ad was the return of, of breaking bad on the Super Bowl.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.000]   That was, at first I thought, did they just take the old footage and put pop chips in there,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.160]   in or whatever those things are, pop corners in their hands?
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.200]   Or did they shoot all new?
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.000]   Because it looked exactly, it was the same RV.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.360]   It looked exactly the same.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.560]   I guess that RV is at the back.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.920]   God bless Brian Cranston.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.280]   He, he is so good.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.720]   He is so game for everything.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.440]   He, he just keeps shaving his head for, if, if, if, if, if, if,
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.640]   for whatever tonight show gags again, what, I'll shave my head.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:46.800]   Sure.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.680]   I'll put on the plastic.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:47.920]   Sure.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.560]   We're good.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.280]   I'm sure whatever they paid in for a super commercial was worth it.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.240]   That, that too.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.160]   But it's just like, how much is square space pay Adam Driver?
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.800]   Seven million bucks for them ad, but how much you pay Adam Driver to make the ads.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.080]   Gotta be, well, it can't be seven.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.760]   Could be a lot though.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.400]   It could be a million.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:04.880]   A million.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.760]   It could be a million dollars.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   For, for, for what, for, for him, it's probably it was a day.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.080]   You know, like it was probably a day of, right, you know, so it's not a bad payday.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.320]   No.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.960]   Uh, show today brought to you by zip recruiter.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.160]   You know, they talk a lot about, we talk a lot about how hard it is to find people
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:26.640]   at these days.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.040]   It is.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.400]   It really is.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.640]   Uh, there's, you know, but that's why we use zip recruiter.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.560]   And I tell you what, it works really, really well.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.120]   Despite what people are saying, you know, despite all the tech layoffs,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.200]   there are a lot of jobs out there.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   Unemployment is very low.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.600]   People are getting hired.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.440]   But you, when you have a opening in your company, when we have an opening at our company,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.720]   we want the right person.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.880]   Cause the company's just, you know, it's made of people.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.160]   The, the right employee, the right person in that position can take you to the moon.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.240]   The wrong one could bring the whole company down.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.920]   If you need to hire, do what we do.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.480]   Go to zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.920]   Not only that, you could try it for free.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.560]   We, uh, you know, we're a small company.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.480]   So when we are down an employee, everybody suffers because everybody's got a pitch in,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.720]   fill that job, get that work done.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.200]   That's why Lisa immediately goes to zip recruiter, like instant, like she gets the,
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.320]   you know, the resignation letter.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.560]   She goes, okay, we got two weeks.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.040]   Let's go.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.480]   Goes right to zip recruiter.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.600]   I've seen this multiple times at breakfast to go, okay, posting it,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.120]   pushes the button.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.520]   It's actually harder to write the job posting than it is to fill it.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.600]   Because as soon as you push the button, zip recruiter posts it to more than 100 job boards
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   to social, they cast the widest net.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.920]   The good news is all of those applicants, as soon as they start pouring in, they don't go to
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.680]   your email or your phone, you're not filling your voicemail.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.400]   They go to the zipper recruiter interface where it's very easy to screen them with,
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.320]   with multiple choice, true, false, even essay questions to, you know, they scan all the resumes
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.280]   into same form.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800]   So it's easy to scan through them.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.120]   You can rank them, rate them, hire the right person fast, but then they do something extra
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.080]   special that to me makes all the difference in the world.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.800]   See, people, a lot of job hunters go to zip recruiter.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.080]   That's a, you know, that's, they've got more than a million resume, current resumes.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.360]   So they use their technology or matching technology.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.400]   I like it.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.360]   They don't call it AI.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.560]   It kind of is though to find the qualified candidates for the job you just posted.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.160]   So it looks at what you just posted, what the requirements are, looks at those resumes
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.920]   and says, Hey, here's 20 people.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.800]   We think might be right.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.880]   You look at them, you go, you know what?
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.080]   Those three are fantastic and you invite them to apply.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.080]   And I'll tell you every single time you invite somebody to apply, they're so flattered.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.600]   They're so happy to be asked.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.160]   They follow through, they show up, they do the interview, everything.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.040]   It's really great.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.760]   They're much more likely to apply.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.400]   And you're much more likely to get an employee who's really excited to be there.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.240]   I think zip recruiter is fantastic.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.120]   She'll post it breakfast by before lunch even.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.000]   She'll start saying, Hey, we got a good one.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.960]   It's like fishing.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.600]   We got one.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.840]   I got a bite and we got, oh, this one's really good.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.880]   The next one really even.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.560]   And that is a great feeling when you're down a person to know you could hire somebody right now.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.200]   I love zipper recruiter.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.480]   You will too, four out of five employers who post a zipper recruiter get a quality
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.640]   candidate in the first day.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.000]   Find quality candidates fast.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.120]   Let zip recruiter help you keep your team growing strong.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Find the right person.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.680]   That's the key.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.080]   Go to zipper recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.040]   You can try it for free.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:51.440]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R, zip recruiter.com/macbr.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.240]   Just like the show.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.800]   Zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.880]   We thank you so much for supporting Macbreak Weekly.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.400]   We thank you for supporting us now more than ever.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.640]   You really make a difference when you go to that website and you use that particular
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.960]   URL, zipper recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.880]   Because then they go, oh, oh, it works.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.400]   Just like zipper recruiter.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:10.880]   It works.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   Thank you, zipper recruiter.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:20.640]   Ah, Apple's having a little trouble manufacturing in India.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.400]   You know, this is the big thing now.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.600]   What with balloons and all?
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.960]   We really got to get out of China.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.760]   So they started with a really big balloon.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.960]   And then they went to a smaller balloon and procured.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.480]   We don't know, though, what those other balloons,
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.000]   they haven't said they're Chinese yet.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.320]   There's a bunch of science kids that are just like,
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   "Ah, just had someone's own kid."
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.080]   You know, we launch in the world, 1600 weather balloons a day.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.400]   Hundreds in the US alone.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.480]   Which is probably why they were filtering them out before this.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.440]   They didn't look correct.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.240]   They didn't want to see them.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.200]   They're weathering.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.800]   We're just attacking us with a weather balloon.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.480]   Gotta just turn the game up a little bit like,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.920]   "Ah, let's not pay attention to that."
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.640]   Well, now we know, unfortunately.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.160]   But that's not the problem.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.520]   The problem is other things.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.800]   The geopolitical situation, etc, etc.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.680]   So Apple has been trying to move out of China.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.880]   Story in the financial times today.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.040]   Apple's manufacturing shift to India hits stumbling blocks,
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.640]   under-pressured unwind its China-oriented supply chain,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.920]   you know, following the COVID disruptions, so forth.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.960]   Apple has been sending product designers and engineers
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.200]   from California to China
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.600]   to factories in southern India to train locals.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.160]   But, you know, and I bet this happened in China
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.720]   when they first started producing phones in China.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   They're having trouble.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.440]   A caseing factory in Hosuhar,
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.520]   run by Indian conglomerate Tata, one of Apple suppliers.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.200]   About one out of every two components
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.400]   coming off the production line.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.320]   Half are good enough to be sent to Foxconn for assembly.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.680]   And they say in that article that there is a goal that more,
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.040]   that there would be zero.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.000]   I mean, you'd have 100%, but that doesn't happen on Apple products.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.320]   Right.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.120]   You know, there's, you know, so the thing is there's,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.160]   that's their goal.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.880]   But the fact that half, we don't know what it is in China.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.840]   Like it's not 100%.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.240]   So what they're not telling us what that failure rate is.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.560]   When the first touchpads came out, you know,
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.960]   the trackpads that didn't have any mechanical,
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.880]   the rumor is that the failure rate on those was 60%.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.680]   60% of them had to go back.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.040]   When they were tested.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.080]   So, Apple won zero defects, so they're not going to accept it.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.120]   You want, yeah, we all, you know, and I want a pony,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.040]   but it doesn't mean that I, you know, there's no,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.000]   there's the factory processes imperfect,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.760]   and they're not getting zero defects anywhere.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.720]   I guarantee it.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.880]   So I don't know what the defect rate is in China,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.080]   but it's probably 10 or 15%.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   Right.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.480]   And so there's, so that's so happy.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.240]   Well, I just mean zero defects per unit.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.000]   They're going to reject any unit that's not.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.320]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.760]   But I'm saying they, Apple's good at that.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.440]   They're, the problem is that you just have how much of it
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.400]   do you have to send back?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.560]   This is the part when people say this is how much the phone costs,
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.800]   what they're not calculating is that model is what percentage of them
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.320]   don't ever get into a box.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   It may also be a cultural difference.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.080]   Because the time says in China, suppliers and government officials took a,
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.520]   whatever it takes approach to win iPhone owner orders,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.360]   former Apple employees describe instances in which they'd estimate a certain task
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.760]   might take several weeks, only show up the next morning to find it had already been done.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.840]   An inexplicable speed.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.480]   Well, next paragraph says operations in India are not running at that sort of pace.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.600]   It turns out if you, if you, if you run everybody into the wall and make them,
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.720]   you know, go 20 hours a day, you can do a lot of things done.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.480]   So I mentioned you're briefed on the matter.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.920]   It's a totalitarian state.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   So much easier.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.000]   Got, well, yeah, you got some.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.720]   And India is, India is, has ambitions in that direction.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.000]   I mean, do, Modi would love to crack that way.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.960]   Start looking up a BBC documentary on the current, on the current administration
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.320]   and see how quickly all of those reporting gets stuck,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.240]   struck down by YouTube and elsewhere.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.120]   So, yeah, I mean, it's, China, China,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.680]   China, in fact, first of all, the article is talking specifically about iPhone case parts,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.200]   not necessarily, that's right.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.640]   Not necessarily like full assemblies.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.320]   And the article also mentioned something that I read here and there,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.880]   that occasionally zero manufacturing defects, obviously it's never, it's an ideal.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.640]   It's not a, it's not a real goal, but they get damn close sometimes.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.320]   But the thing is, you know, how long has,
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.120]   manufacturing India, I think the last,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.760]   would just start with older phones in like 2016, 2017.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.240]   And I think this, I don't know whether this, what this article is referring to,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.600]   but I know that the, I do know that the iPhone 14 parts start being manufactured in September,
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.280]   at least that's when they announced it.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.160]   So, if they're not up to speed after three or four months,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.240]   having never manufactured this part before, that's, I'm not saying that's okay,
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.760]   but that doesn't mean that there's, that's a fatal issue that will prevent Apple from wanting
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.880]   to pursue manufacturing outside of the systems that they know and love.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.920]   I like what you said, Leo, about how this is probably how it started in China.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.520]   I mean, I know people, sometimes poo poo, Tim Cook and other people at Apple,
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.400]   when they say that, you know, you can't just pick up the supply chain and move it out of China,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.320]   because we don't, there aren't other places like the United States that have expertise
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.840]   in this particular area, and you have to build manufacturing expertise.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.720]   I think this is a great example of that, where, you know, this isn't, you flip a switch,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.240]   and now you're making things in India.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.960]   You have to do things tough stuff that we don't think about, like,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.760]   go to this factory and say, okay, you're going to make these cases for iPhones, these,
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:39.200]   these aluminum parts, and it's going to take us five years to get to a failure rate that we're
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.720]   happy with. And that's just the cost of, of setting up a brand new business in a new place
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.040]   that doesn't have expertise like that, and they can ship in experts, and maybe that'll speed things
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:55.680]   up. But I think you're right that this is really about Apple having to invest in India to build it
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.720]   up to become a place that can manufacture at this level that they expect.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.760]   I'm not knocking it out.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.440]   Vanch and I are a chatroom is pointing out. Everybody jokes about the Apple text,
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.240]   but this is where it comes from, he says, they have an insane quality standard, you know,
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.000]   you want the hardware to be reliable.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.400]   And if it's a part that other people use, Apple can come in and say, we're going to take the best
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.720]   parts and the ones we reject get sold out to someone else. But if it's a molded aluminum
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:24.080]   iPhone shell, no one else is going to use that shell. So it's just melted down, right?
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.360]   Melt it down and start over. Okay.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:33.760]   Tata, the company I mentioned, is a big industrial conglomerate in China. The financials time says,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.720]   and they have ambitious plan, I'm sorry, India, ambitious plans to become a full service apple
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.440]   supplier like the Taiwanese. And it has the approval and backing of the Indian government.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.520]   They're in talks to buy an iPhone assembly plant that was owned by Wistron in Bangalore,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:56.800]   Wistron wants to exit after experiencing labor unrest and protests in 2020.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:03.760]   So and Apple's got caught on pretty, it's a pretty technical company as well.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:10.080]   So they'll make cars. Yeah, they just bought, they make everything. They're like the Samsung of
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:15.280]   India. Okay. Yeah. And they, they have a huge fiber network and a lot of inner bit gravity was
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.400]   bought by back in the day, was bought by Tata. Well kidding. The switch. Yeah. And the switch,
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.760]   which is a huge fiber network in the United States just got purchased about a month ago.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.240]   Oh, thought I was definitely kind of moving up that ladder as well as just taking their scale
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.760]   and really moving towards more value added products. And so this is definitely a high,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:39.360]   probably high one on their list. Indian government has a simmering border dispute with China.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:45.200]   Let's not forget. And that might be another reason why India might kind of foster some
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.920]   growth there. I mean, it just, Apple needs to get out of,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.520]   they don't, it's not that they need to get out of China. They just need to get,
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.760]   so that it's 30%, 40%, 50% of their supply chain that it doesn't go to zero. Right now,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.320]   if something happened, if China went into Taiwan or another big thing, it would just shut Apple
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.640]   down. Like they wouldn't, they would have no phones, you know, or very few. And so they need
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.640]   to be building 30, 50, 70% of their capacity outside of China. The hard part is, again, that
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:21.280]   that so much ingrained after decades of, you know, or 15 years or whatever of production,
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.480]   it takes a long time. It will probably take them another two or three years to be
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:31.120]   not as efficient, but efficient enough to be another supplier that gives Apple somewhere to go.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.680]   And I think that a lot of people when, when generals talk about need to be ready to go into
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:42.160]   Taiwan by 2027, all the companies in the United States go need to be out of China by 2027.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.120]   And so, so that, you know, I think that that's the mistake that the Chinese government's making
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.320]   is by having these public proclamations of when they're going to cause horrible trouble. That is,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.440]   that is a horrible problem for all these corporations. They are setting this exodus up that is going
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.480]   to destroy their country, like, you know, financially destroy the country. It's, it's a crazy, it's a
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.200]   lot to it takes a while. I mean, this is why, you know, take at the end of the article, they say,
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.960]   they talk about an analyst just says, if Apple would want to be making iPhones in
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.000]   India, they should have started five years ago. It takes five years to get up to speed. So, oh,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.800]   yeah. You know, and and how many, and how many weeks did it take for Russia to get completely
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.960]   cut off after the invasion of Ukraine? All you all you need is all you need is banks have
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.640]   be prohibited from doing transactions with the country and oh my goodness,
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.680]   well, and I just, even without the banks being cut off, it's just that it means that it's
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:37.440]   socially unacceptable to do work in Russia right now and that'll happen in China. And, you know,
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.360]   I think that it didn't, I don't think it clarified for people what could happen until Ukraine,
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.280]   you know, like, I think it just, I think there was a lot of talk about it. No, we should do something.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.640]   But I think when Ukraine hit in Russia, basically no brand could work in Russia. I think a bunch
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   of brands took notice and said, this is, you know, when we got China rattling about this, the China
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:03.520]   Taiwan conversation looks a lot like the Russian Ukraine conversation. So, I think that there was
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.200]   enough, it wasn't apples to apples, but it was close enough that a whole bunch of corporations
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.360]   now have connected the dots and they're like, we got to, we got to get out of here, you know,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.880]   it was a Christmas feature for sure. Yeah. Some guy at Macworld writing, what I think is a fairly
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:24.080]   link-baity article. I didn't write the headline. What if apples next big thing never comes?
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:30.160]   Four scenarios that could spell apples. I mean, I think I said number three will surprise you,
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.400]   imagining apples biggest potential threats, but they don't ever leave my headlines in there. But
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:40.480]   the, the, this is a perfect connection to the previous conversation because what if, yeah, I think
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:47.120]   the mid-term, short-to-mid-term, worst-threat apple faces is a confrontation with China.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:53.840]   And because they're just not prepared at this point for the loss of their supply chain. And then
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   the long-term is, I really believe is just literally what comes after the smartphone as a product
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:04.640]   category, because I have a hard time believing my other scenarios are, what if apple just kind of
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.680]   doesn't pay attention to the iPhone and it, and it fades away, which seems unlikely to me. I feel
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.400]   like we're going to have iPhones and Android phones battling it out for a long time to come.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.480]   And then the other thread is like government regulation. And even there, it's possible that
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.960]   government regulation could completely break apples business model. But again, it seems like
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.840]   apple will respond and survive. And that's not an existential threat. But, and I heard from some
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.680]   people who wrote me and said, yeah, you're, I think you understate the, the issues in China,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.960]   but I don't think I did. I think that it's absolutely true that in the, in the, in the near-to-medium term,
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.760]   that is the one thing that could really cause the an existential crisis for apple. And then the
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.240]   long run, my other point was, this is why they're spending money on that AR VR stuff, is that really,
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.840]   when you've got all the money apple has more than a hundred billion dollars a cash, the way you
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:59.600]   make sure you're, you're going to survive in the long term is by, you know, investing in the potential
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.080]   replacement for your biggest product. And that way, if your biggest product gets replaced, guess what?
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.880]   You've got a new biggest product to replace it. And, but the China issue is, I think, the one that
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.240]   they, and they can't just flip a switch like we've been saying is going to take years for them
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.800]   to, to get out of that one. And if something happens in the meantime, that could be extremely
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.880]   dangerous for apple. I think services are a big deal for apple as well. I think you're going to
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.760]   see them try to grow that from 30% to 50% of their revenue, because that, that's something that they
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.800]   have a lot more control over than hardware. And so, you know, being able to have, you know,
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.040]   and I think that they'll keep on looking for where they can add those services to that, to that process.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.080]   And I think the AR, VR stuff is all part of that as well, is there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:47.840]   And so I think that they, I do think that I do agree that China is a, is a big problem for everybody,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.680]   but apple probably more exposed than most in being able to make that work. So it'll be interesting.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.480]   And it is, and apple is in kind of a, it's great that they're doing such great work and
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:03.200]   expanding services. Let's not forget that the app store is included as part of the services
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:10.000]   pie. But the thing is, one of the reasons why the iPhone competes so well in a really competitive
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.160]   phone market is that it really is its own category. There's nothing quite like an iPhone.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.040]   And a lot of it really is about the emotional connection that you have to it, the way it feels
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.760]   in your hand, the way it responds to you, the way that you treat it like a, like a laptop or like
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.280]   a little pet services. I don't think anybody is like, Oh my goodness, I have such loyalty to
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:35.360]   high cloud. It makes me feel good when I click into it and I sync my, it's really iCloud is just
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:42.960]   another cloud cloud sharing service. Apple TV really is just another streaming service. Apple
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.440]   means like really it's a very high quality one. But how many years have been competing with
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.960]   Spotify directly and Spotify is still by order of not by an order magnitude, but by a multiple
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:00.080]   has a larger, as a much larger paid audience. So if, if Apple really does have to keep selling
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.040]   a hard worker's that's the special sauce. That's where they put the aura of we know how to make
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.960]   make a physical devices that people are tangibly react to and are willing to pay a premium for.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:15.440]   If they were to try to invert that pie and basically turn them themselves into 62%
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.560]   services company, I really think that would be very, very volatile for them.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.760]   I don't, I don't, it's generally, I mean, the business side of this is that generally,
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:32.160]   subscription is the least volatile thing you can do because people, people, the, the, in most cases
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:39.120]   in almost every business, including, you know, your gym membership all the way up. It's a pretty
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.920]   stable business model. And so probably one of the most stable business models, because people
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.880]   just don't change that often. And they change it, you know, it's, and especially as the lock-in builds
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.760]   up, as a, as someone who's totally into the Apple ecosystem, the thought, I mean, I have,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.440]   I still have Spotify, I think for some random reason, I think I just can't get some of my,
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.880]   I was unable to properly export some stuff out, but I have an open Spotify in a year, you know,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.400]   and, and I thought about that recently, because I was getting, thinking about, to your point,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.800]   getting rid of those subscriptions because I'm not using it anymore. And I think that Apple can
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.400]   kind of just keep weighing on, I don't think they're trying to get rid of iPhone sales. I think
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.160]   they're just trying to grow services so that they're even that much bigger. So iPhones keep selling
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.360]   the way they are. But the bigger that services model gets, and the bigger that they keep on opening
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.640]   up these accessories and all the other things that they're putting out there, I still think that
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.000]   that's why the home vertical would make a lot of sense for them to make five core assets that,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   that are just that, that all just happened to work with everything, because it just be another
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   thing that would add 10 or 15% to the revenue, but it doesn't really get them out of China.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.080]   So I think that, so I think that, I do think that services are a big piece of that. I think that,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.680]   I'd be really interested to see, I mean, I just do think that there's a lot of people that are
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   almost guaranteed to buy things from Apple right now because they take so long and because they
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.720]   usually come out working. I think that the AR systems will probably do pretty well.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.920]   And I think that the car, if they ever put it out, people like me would buy it. And so like,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   we were like, sure, I'll get one of those. So I think that, because I can tell you one thing,
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.960]   is most people don't care about their car. And you look at that, an Apple user probably cares
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.040]   about the Apple brand way more than any car brand that they have.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.440]   I don't know. I mean, you have to,
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.160]   people are pretty attached to their Teslas until Elon became.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:29.360]   I think people are attached to their $400 Apple watches, they're attached to their $1000 phones,
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.000]   they're attached to their $2000 laptops. Are they so attached to that logo? They're willing to
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.920]   spend 30, 40, 50, 70, 70,000 dollars on a car from an unproven company? I don't know.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.240]   That's what they said. The problem with that is that that's what they said with phones.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.600]   I know it's more money, but they said, oh, you don't know anything about different phones.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.320]   It's so different. It was a very, very similar thing, though.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:56.800]   I see what I see we were getting at, but I don't think the two are comparable.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.280]   I think that it's just that my relationship with cars is the same as my relationship was with a
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:07.600]   palm trio, which is that I drive the car that I least hate. Even like I don't have a car that I
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.960]   love. I haven't driven a car that I loved ever. This is the best one that I could afford.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   I think that's a bet. You are unique. I don't think the world is going to be the path to Apple's
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:26.080]   door to drive the Apple car. I don't think so. No, but again, if you've got $100 billion in cash,
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:34.240]   place some bets and see what happens. But I think the ARVR thing is the place where they're
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.280]   really placing a bet against how do we make sure that the iPhone, because it's the iPhone.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.160]   That's the story. When we talk about the Mac and the iPad, that's all great. It's the iPhone
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.120]   and the ecosystem around primarily the iPhone. Do we think that's going away? I don't think so.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.200]   I think it's going to be around a long time. I think I said in that column, in a decade,
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.000]   I would be shocked if Samsung and Apple weren't the two biggest phone makers.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.840]   It's hard to imagine. It's just going to own it forever.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.760]   The smartphone people are like, oh, but what's next after the smartphone? It's like, guys,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.440]   we don't know. The smartphone is the culmination. I would argue the culmination of the entire
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.240]   personal computer industry was leading to the smartphone. We're not going to see a product
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:18.400]   category like that probably in our lifetimes. If you're one of the major players in that category,
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.960]   pretty nice place to be. I think Apple's biggest real vulnerability is that they just kind of get
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   fat and happy and lazy. Their product suffers and over time it just slides away and ends up
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.280]   being super mediocre and not good. But I think the most likely scenario is they're just going to
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.840]   be rolling in dough for a long time to come as long as they can still make phones in China.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.320]   And as long as the iPhone doesn't get replaced by glasses that we all wear, and that's why they're
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.360]   spending tens of billions of dollars on AR and VR. But there's a approximate threat and there's
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.680]   a distant threat. The approximate threat really is China. I think it is. And to some other
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.560]   government, you mentioned government also. They would have to break them. I mean,
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.480]   it is possible they could say, you can't put apps on the phone anymore. You have to just
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.920]   you have to download apps from the internet and you can't preload any apps and it could or you
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.840]   know, or something else you have to license your OS. It's not going to be the US government because
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.920]   Apple is too much of a driver of value. No, but like the EU doesn't care if Apple falters.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   I just have a hard time imagining that even the EU would break their business model. Like,
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.840]   there's lots of things Apple doesn't want the EU to do because Apple wants to make lots of money.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.800]   But even if the EU prevents them from doing those things, it's still hard not to see Apple being
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.400]   a wildly profitable company. So China's number one, clearly.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:37.920]   Number two, government. Distant. I mean, I phone, I think that's not threatened for quite some time.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.720]   Long time. And I think it's very unproven that a car or AR is either one of those
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.480]   is going to be the next big thing. I don't think we necessarily know what the next big thing is.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.040]   Right. And if there were another next big thing floating out there, and I think that's true,
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.120]   I think the truth is there isn't another next big thing floating out there anytime soon.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.040]   I think it's going to be a long time. If there were, then Apple and Google and every other tech
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.480]   company would be spending tens of billions on dollars on that too. Because they don't want to be
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.000]   replaced. This thing that you put in your pocket is pretty close to perfect. I don't know if you
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.960]   can, which they try to kind of replace it with a watch, it's too small. Put it in the ear. I don't
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:19.280]   think so. On the eyes, maybe, maybe not. I honestly think that this is a very optimized form factor.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.400]   I've, yeah, maybe that's shortsighted. And you can add on. You can add on the watch and the
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.880]   headphones and things if you want to have them being sort of like using that as your central
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.400]   processor. But the, at the core, a supercomputer that's attached to a high speed, you know,
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.480]   computer network that goes all over the world that runs custom software in your pocket.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.840]   I would submit that as long as there are pockets, there will be
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:48.880]   phones. I really, I mean, there is there is the science fiction. They're carrying around things
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:53.920]   in their hands that are computers. Yeah. Yeah. And let's not forget about one of the most pertinent
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:00.080]   parts about smartphones. You can pay $1,700 for a smartphone. You can pay nothing for a smartphone.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:07.360]   Yeah. And essentially, the hardware today is good enough that there's a certain basic
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.880]   table stakes consistency of features. And also, there are features that are better on one
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.320]   handset than the other. But mostly, they're all just inert devices that connect to the same apps
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:26.080]   in the same features. So it's hard to figure out the when you look at phones, there's nothing
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.040]   that looks like it's going to knock those phones out of people's pockets. Just like someone who
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.280]   looked at the first laptops 30 years ago, might be surprised that no, it's still with dominant
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.840]   platform. People who looked at your basic, Hey, here's a point of advice. Hey, here's a screen.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.120]   Hey, here's a keyboard in the late 1980s, 1990s that that's still the dominant thing.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:51.280]   Nothing came to replace it because it does that job really, really well. And there's enough
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.440]   variety in the marketplace so that no matter what kind of need you have, you can find the
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.840]   thing at the price point and at the form factor that you need. So I guess, though,
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:06.480]   if I were going to try to be, you know, contrarian, I would point out that computers,
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:13.760]   because IBM didn't patent and copyright and trademark and do all the legal things to protect
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:22.240]   the PC, their market completely got undermined by compatibles. Apples avoided that cleverly.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.920]   There is no iPhone compatible, but I could see perhaps a scenario and it's a bit of a stretch
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:33.440]   where people go, you know, I don't, it's not safe to use the iPhone because it's a big company that
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:42.000]   owns it. I want something that's open. And there's these guys making phones that are open and secure
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.680]   and not a privacy issue and they're cheaper than the iPhone. This market could be undermined.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.280]   It seems it would be a tough one. It's not impossible. I don't think anybody's saying
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   it's impossible. I just think Samsung sells more phones than Apple. I think, well, sure,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:02.800]   but Samsung is also a big company with a little powering. So it's two apples,
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.880]   basically working together there. So the Linux or something else more.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.400]   Wouldn't there be a third party? I mean, couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't be an open
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.240]   ecosystem. It's too complex for somebody to come along and just say, yeah, yeah, because Linux is
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.800]   the people have tried people talk about it. They're like, oh, we're gonna have a new phone.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.560]   It's gonna change everything and never does. There's plenty of reasons to not want to use Mac or
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.880]   Windows. No, it doesn't mean people run the Linux. I think my bigger argument would be if there were
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.920]   a real geopolitical schism and for example, in China, if they were going to just sort of cut
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.440]   themselves off from Apple and Google that they would perhaps even based on Android,
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:45.040]   but they would create and they already have an independent Android in China is the Google
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.800]   system. So yeah, that would be an alternative for at least some markets.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.480]   And Samsung has threatened to do that a couple times with their own.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.560]   Sure. So it's not so hard to make this hardware, is it?
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.080]   Well, I think Apple's very good at the hardware. I think that there are peers like Samsung who
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.480]   are also very, very good. Apple's hardware is very good. And they're building their own
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.320]   processors, right, which give them advantages to they're smart. They're really pulling up the
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.640]   drop bridge in every place they can. And that's why my iPhone argument is that I think it's going
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.440]   to be hard to displace them as one of the players is because they you can't just surpass them in
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   one of those areas. You have to surpass them in multiple areas. You place them, but will they
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.280]   always have 50% of the market or whatever it is? Is it? It's what is it globally? Is US is 50?
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.880]   It's last globally. It's like 80 something. So they're already kind of a minority player worldwide.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.680]   And it doesn't matter. They make more money than anybody. Well, and they've got the high end of the
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.440]   market and it's high profit margins and all of those things, right? So that that's why they're
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.160]   printing money. It's just it's going to be tough to displace them. And I mean, my original intro to
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:55.280]   my little column on Macworld was about my dad who he passed away 10 years ago. But I still think
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.880]   about him all the time because he grew up in the middle of the depression. And he had that
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.000]   depression mindset his entire life, which is like we we saved everything. He fixed stuff with with
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.800]   the wire out of a coat hanger like all the time. And Steve Jobs, when he came back to Apple, that's
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.840]   what he did with Apple's culture is make take every dollar off the table. You know, don't hire
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.160]   too many people. It's why they didn't lay off people is they're so slow at hiring people because
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.280]   Apple is kind of paranoid about its existence. And it's funny to step outside of that and look at
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.480]   Apple and say this company that's completely paranoid about the fact that it could go away at any
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.120]   time and it can't have partners. It has to make everything for themselves. And yet it's actually
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:39.360]   kind of hard to envision scenarios where it is not still around making huge amounts of money
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.080]   for maybe decades. That's kind of funny. That same editor that wrote the crappy headline took
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.040]   your dad out of it as well. No, I cut I cut that back. It was like too much. I'm my own editor too.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.440]   I was like, this is a little self indulgent to talk about my to talk about my dad. I like it.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.520]   I cut it out. But it is it is definitely that generation. Steve Jobs did to Apple what that
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.160]   generation did, which is say never assume that you're going to have. But you can build as many
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:11.040]   modes as you want. Yes, there's what you can't control is people's mindset. It's true. And and
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.360]   we've seen it happen before. And that's what happened to my space is people's it wasn't that
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.040]   they were superseded by something technically better. People's mindset changed. And at some
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.640]   point I could see people's mindset saying for whatever reason I'm not there's no evidence this
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.560]   is going to happen. But for whatever reason, I don't want Apple anymore. iPhone's not cool.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.320]   And I don't like it. I don't like it. It was dangerous. It's something. The advantages that
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.760]   they've got all the market share and they've got all the apps. And so they don't have the the
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.160]   risk that Facebook has where people like I'm tired of Facebook. Again, it's like they really
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.640]   pulled up all the drivers. Just like just choose if you don't like that app try this other app on
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.000]   the iPhone. And you can just keep on going. That's what kept Microsoft try as they might from making
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.680]   a mobile platform. They didn't have the apps. And it killed Windows phone. And I think it is
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.440]   it's tricky. And I think Apple's pretty good. The PR thing because it is the PR is part of it
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.240]   is to make sure that the brand stays shiny. I watched this great thing yesterday last night about
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:14.480]   why Nickelback is so unpopular. Why is Nickelback so unpopular? So it came down to they they
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.160]   analyzed and they said we came down to one comedian on one show. But it happened to his
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.240]   people. It became a meme used over and over and over again. So it became me mission. It became
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.840]   this thing. And they said that in the in the fact that they were just getting so much airplay.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.240]   They said there was a time when at every second of every day Nickelback was playing somewhere in
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.360]   the United States. But that's exactly the shift I'm talking about where it's it could you know,
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.520]   I think you could trigger it. And it just if the timing is right and Apple could be the next
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.760]   Nickelback. It feels it feels like they have so far to fall that even then they'd be able to survive.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.560]   But we're fish in the water. We don't see the water right? We are so we it's hard for us to
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.920]   imagine replace Google replace Apple. How could that one? I think place but I think it happens all
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.520]   the time. It's totally real. And I think it gets back to a little bit of what Andy said,
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.520]   which is the the fact that the hardware keeps you kind of embedded because we can think about
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.800]   things but then we still have a Mac and we still have these other things that were in our phone
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.360]   and our watch and everything else. So it slows down some of that movement. It's one thing
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.080]   not to buy a Nickelback album. It's another thing to change off your phone or your operating system.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.000]   So I think that that would happen very slowly. I don't think it could be.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.800]   There are people. My daughter everybody in our family's Apple. My daughter insists on using
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.960]   Android. She says Apple is a cult. And that that you know that's a I think it's generation only.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.320]   That's been going on for 40 years. Yeah, the cult of Mac, right? But she says I'm not going to
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.120]   join that cult. I'm sorry. You guys are crazy. It's fine. It's just that I think the problem is that
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.160]   Apple Apple has been exceptional at finding what 90% of the people want 90% of the time.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:54.320]   And I think that it is it's hard. It's hard to get because that's a big market
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.440]   and they don't care about being cool. They don't really. I mean, some people are getting Apple
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.200]   stuff to be cool or whatever, but most people just it just works. It just works and it doesn't.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.840]   And they don't I think Apple users care less about their hardware than Android users to be
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.720]   honest with you because they just want it to be out of the way and have it just do its thing.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.480]   They don't want to geek out on it as much. They just want it to work when they turn it on and move
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.920]   move around. And I think that people who want to play with it more cannot to use.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.400]   Well, if you make a phone a commodity, that's the commoditization of the product, right? If the
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.520]   if the product becomes a commodity, like the PC became a commodity, right? Then Apple, you know,
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.960]   you'd have but I think that's the greatest danger to the iPhone honestly is if we end up in a world
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.120]   where nobody bothers to make native apps anymore and everything is a progressive web app and they're
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.320]   all just the exact same across all platforms that Apple has even less. They still have
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.560]   differentiation, right? Because they've got their own, you know, rendering engine and they've got
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.080]   their processor. But if they lose apps as a concept and there is no software anymore,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.680]   so every phone runs exactly the same web apps that hurts Apple. That's why the EU is to fear
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.480]   because that's the first chink in the armor is you start to undermine that Apple moat.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.960]   And you know, a little bit. Just remember the boy in the dike, a little hole in that boat.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.400]   Boom, you know, ironically though, it won't be the EU that kills Apple in this scenario. I think
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.760]   it'll be Apple's relationship with bad relationship with its own developers and Apple's development
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.160]   tools and Apple's whole platform for developing apps because that's what I keep hearing is,
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.240]   you know, people get frustrated with Swift and Swift QI and things like that and like and they'd
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.920]   rather and companies would rather just invest in web technologies instead of investing in Apple's
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.320]   development. So anybody can develop for it. Python. Python phone, you and me, you and me,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.760]   we're going to make the Python phone. I mean, everything really slow. I mean,
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.920]   people talk about it, but I mean, I think the hard part is it's competing with someone who's
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.200]   actually writing native code is pretty hard. You know, like I, I was going to turn that lesson.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.520]   Yeah, I worked on a, I worked on a product where we developed a product about three months on,
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.600]   on iOS and it ran perfectly. And then they were like, okay, we're going to move it to react native
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.680]   and then spent a year just watching it just go into like just just just it was as if you just
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.880]   dropped it into, you know, molasses and then let it dry. And then, you know, react native is just
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.520]   a disaster. Anyway, so the, and so the, you know, so I think that people say they want to do that
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.800]   kind of stuff. But when that actually comes down to it, the problem is you're competing with people
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.720]   who would buy a lot of apps that are written natively. And when they're used to the native
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.120]   written apps, they, you can feel it. You can feel the, you can feel the other versions of it. And
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.600]   saying don't get complacent, Alex, things change. I don't think they should.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.400]   I think I don't. So what I will say is I don't think Apple is complacent.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.080]   No, I think you're right. Like I think that that is the thing about Apple is that they are,
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:51.600]   they are always scared. They are always frugal. They are always looking for, they're always looking
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:57.680]   for the knife behind them. But that is not a, that mentality is so, I mean,
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.920]   anytime Andy Groves, the CEO of Intel wrote the book, only the paranoid survive. And he left and
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:10.160]   it's suddenly until Apple is constantly paranoid. All the things you see Apple do is out of it.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:17.760]   1997 is, is, I mean, Steve Jobs set up Apple University, I believe in part, just to instill that
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   ethos in Apple, which has never taken anything for granted. They're coming for you. Tomorrow,
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.200]   we could be completely destroyed. You've got to, you know, everybody's out to get you.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.040]   It's harder when you have 200 billion in the bank.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.280]   It's a lot. It is. It is a lot harder.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.840]   But it's still there. Yeah. Yeah. It is. And it also makes you look worse. If you have that
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.880]   attitude and you're riding high, you don't, you're not seen as frugal. You're seen as cheap,
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.480]   right? Like it changes public perception of you too, to have that attitude.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.240]   Yeah. Why are you not the underdog fighting unionization in its retail stores?
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.440]   You can afford to give people more money in the bank. Yeah.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:58.000]   Hey, everybody. Leo LePort here. I am the founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.320]   network. I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit, because I think it's
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:10.560]   unique. And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech audience,
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.960]   you need to know about what we do here at Twit. We've built an amazing audience of engaged,
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:24.320]   intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us and trust us when we recommend a product.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.960]   Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.720]   Already you should be, your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.360]   is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.720]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.160]   And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.560]   We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:03.440]   and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.640]   And that makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy. We are literally
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.600]   bringing you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.880]   We like to create partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long run,
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   long-term partners that want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:33.680]   Tim Broome, who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one, has been with us
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:39.920]   ever since. He said, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit network."
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.440]   I think the proof is in the pudding. Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible, they've been with us
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:52.000]   for more than 10 years. They stick around because their ads work. And honestly, isn't that why you're
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.600]   buying advertising? You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service attitude. We almost
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:05.360]   think of it as artisanal advertising, boutique advertising. You'll get a full service continuity
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.880]   team. People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you with
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:18.160]   everything from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not alone in this. We embed our ads
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.840]   into the shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows. In fact, often,
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.160]   they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:33.760]   "Yeah, I love that." Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:39.680]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts,
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.000]   saying, "Yeah, that sounds great." We deliver, always over-deliver on impressions. So you know
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.760]   you're going to get the impressions you expect. The ads are unique every time. We don't pre-record
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.520]   them and roll them in. We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.680]   We'll give you great onboarding services, ad tech with pod sites that's free for direct clients,
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.320]   gives you a lot of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.240]   You'll get courtesy commercials. You actually can take our ads and share them across
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.120]   social media and landing pages. That really extends the reach. There are other free goodies,
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.720]   too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.520]   We really want to see this stuff. We give you bonus ads and social media promotion, too.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:32.960]   If you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to a savvy, engaged tech audience,

[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:46.560]   know him, one of the biggest original podcast advertising companies. We've been with him for 16
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.120]   years. Mark said, "The feedback from many advertisers over 16 years across a range of product categories,
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:59.680]   everything from razors to computers, is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for a brand,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.200]   they're going to work on twit shows." I'm very proud of what we do because it's honest. It's
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:13.200]   got integrity. It's authentic. It really is a great introduction to our audience of your brand.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.880]   Our listeners are smart. They're engaged. They're tech savvy. They're dedicated to our network.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.000]   And that's one of the reasons we only work with high-integrity partners that we've personally
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.600]   and thoroughly vetted. I have absolute approval on everybody. If you've got a great product,

[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:55.360]   I can't wait to see your product. So give us a ring. We're pushing into... Remember,
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.880]   Apple made a big deal about we're going to offer you a buy now pay later. We're going to offer you
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:08.640]   a way to rent or pay a monthly fee for your devices. All of that has not happened, even though Apple
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:16.640]   said it would sooner than it has happened. This is from Mark Gurman's Power on Newsletter.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.480]   Apple's pushing the next generation financial services hits delays. You've been arguing, Alex,
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.640]   Lindsay, Apple should get into the banking business. I'm not arguing they should. I'm arguing they are.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.240]   But it's moving a little slower. Aren't they going to do savings accounts?
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.400]   They're going to... It may go in fits and starts, but eventually there's going to be...
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.160]   I think that there's going to be the ability to put your money into some kind of thing that
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.480]   slowly becomes more and more looking like an Apple bank.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.560]   Bigger boat. Another big boat.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:54.000]   Yep. I think Jeff Bezos said your margin is my opportunity. And I think Apple's your
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.360]   dis-satisfaction is our opportunity. And anything that is mediocre or below, I think,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:07.760]   is something that somewhat an Apple is looking at as a next outlet. And I think that no one likes
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:13.200]   their bank. So the question is what are the delays?
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.920]   That's hard. It's regulatory.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.720]   Gurman says, "I believe the delays to all four initiatives stem from engineering challenges,
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:27.120]   as well as work on a next generation financial system to support them." That's an interesting.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.120]   He says, "Creating this underlying platform is one of the most ambitious parts of Apple's finance
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.840]   efforts. It's called Project Breakout. It's own technology for handling interest calculations,
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:43.680]   rewards, credit checks, approvals, transaction histories. Currently, Goldman Sachs does all of
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.120]   that for the Apple card. They want to take that back in house."
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.880]   Well, and Apple got a lot of heat because of how Goldman was running Apple cards credit ratings
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.280]   and so forth. I think Goldman Sachs was always a short term. It was a short term,
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.800]   short term, a decade. It'll probably be a decade of Goldman Sachs. But I think that
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:11.120]   it made sense for them to get somebody in that's already got all the regulatory basis, figure things
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.000]   out, see the data, so on and so forth. But I think that eventually it makes a lot of sense for Apple
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.960]   to own that whole thing. And their ability to disrupt this, again, it's pretty high because
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.640]   you get a lot of people with savings accounts and then you have a lot of people that need to borrow
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.560]   money, you get a very closed system pretty quickly. So it's a no company in the history of the
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.880]   world has been able to do what Apple is on its way to doing. If it decides to go that path,
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   which is that you have the people saving money into your accounts and you're taking that money
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.160]   that they're saving in your account and you're providing this credit to people who are buying
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.840]   stuff from you at a global scale. Well, it was also a smart move because apparently Goldman has
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:53.200]   lost billions of dollars on the Apple card. So Apple dodged that bullet.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.240]   Germond says after delay of several months, the companies prepare to release the first version
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.080]   of Apple Pay Later, BNPL, to consumers. Several weeks ago, it started allowing corporate Apple
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.960]   employees to test the feature earlier this month. It opened up to retail employees,
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.000]   essentially creating a test group with tens of thousands of people. But those people are
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.120]   enjoying from sharing screenshots or you cannot. So we're not seeing any leaks around that,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:28.720]   except for what Mark says. They did that with the Apple card in 2019. They provided it to retail
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.480]   staff about a month before the public release. So maybe we're getting close now to BNPL.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:43.200]   Also, what about the Apple High Interest Savings account? They announced it in October. They said
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.120]   it would be released in the coming months. Well, I guess we're still in the coming months,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:55.440]   technically. They quickly added the underlying code. Germond writes to support the feature in
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.880]   iOS 16.1. Goldman Sachs published its fine print for the service in December since then
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.960]   Zippity Duda, iPhone subscription service. We still don't know what that would be.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.000]   Some are saying it's like a rental where you don't even really just pay a monthly fee and
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.800]   you don't really even own the phone. So we're still unclear what that's going to be.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.560]   That one is legitimately interesting. I don't understand why...
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.960]   It's kind of just sounding like I'm just making a glib joke here. But if they want to get into
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.720]   banking services, why not have fast food delivery? Why not have a chain of pizza stores?
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:40.800]   It's just such a random thing for them to get into. That's not necessarily tied into what
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:47.120]   Apple historically does and historically does well. But the idea of having a subscription plan for
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:56.240]   phones, I'm sure they've seen some data that says that there is a revenue source in the iPhone
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.840]   that they're not capturing. And that's what happens to this phone after the person upgrades.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.640]   And let's say they don't necessarily pass it down to one of their kids or something like that.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.680]   It goes to a reseller or it gets parted out and that person makes a profit on the sale,
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.600]   that makes a profit on reselling the parts, makes a profit on reselling the phone.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.560]   I'm sure that they're looking at numbers and saying that what if we were to capture that market
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.440]   ourselves? What if we were the people who get the recycled phone when someone's done's done with it?
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.320]   We are the ones who can refab it and repackage it and resell it in another part of the world
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.520]   in another market. That makes a lot more sense to me than most of the other stuff that's been
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.760]   in these banking articles.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:46.800]   Apple has hired its first people officer. This is also from Mup Bloomberg from Medtronics comes
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.600]   Carol Surface. Right. She's Carol iPad now. Yeah, they have to change that name.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.840]   Many people think Surface is our iPad. So, it's the other jokes.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:02.240]   This was something Deidre O'Brien was doing. She's in charge of retail now. Carol Surface.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.720]   She is Surface Pro. We don't know. Oh, she seems very professional.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:13.360]   She seems professional. Sorry, I'll stop. Surface brings it. It's hard to say it though.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.680]   It brings an incredible depth of experience. The company said, which will be invaluable in
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.880]   supporting our teams around the world and building everything that makes Apple so special.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.240]   Deidre O'Brien will continue to run retail.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:31.200]   Yeah, it's weird not to accompany their size not to have somebody in charge of HR.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.000]   That's what people is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I assume, so Deidre O'Brien, most of their
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.680]   people are retail employees. Right. In the green scheme. In the green scheme.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.960]   So, it sort of made sense. And now she's sort of like kind of specialized in retail.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:49.120]   And this is one of those cases too, where it's like, she can't just keep doing both of those
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.200]   jobs. Right. So, they brought in somebody from the outside. And I'm very skeptical always of
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.840]   Apple bringing in senior execs from outside because could there be a culture clash there.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.360]   But if you're going to do it somewhere, something like HR is a good place to do.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.920]   Because HR is the same everywhere because of law. And you need to know the law.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:16.080]   In fact, we use, as many companies do, a third party to do our HR. So, HR is outsourced.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.400]   Many smaller companies do that because it is such a technical thing. And I think somebody's
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.640]   been running HR for big companies going to make the best sense for that particular job.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.440]   I wonder if she has any background in union negotiations.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.240]   I was going to say, and this way, Deirdre doesn't have to do the union busting speeches anymore.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:38.560]   While she's the head of those people's employment, right? She's the head of retail,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.080]   and she's union busting. They can hand that off to somebody. I don't know. I mean,
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.400]   that if you head of HR, my uncle was the head of HR at a big company for a long time. And,
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.120]   you know, negotiating with the union is part of the job. That's the job.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:56.240]   That's a big part. If you're in a potential union job or a real union industry, you got a,
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.960]   you got a, all of that. So, I wonder if that was why they brought her in is to
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.680]   be the point person on dealing with this, because Apple's trying very hard to not allow their
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.800]   employees to unionize. Yeah, we were talking about some of the retail people getting to use the
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.760]   buy-and-out pay-later, not in 1000. No. The unionized Apple store.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.600]   Don't get that perk. You don't get that.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:24.240]   Spite. It's just spite. It's just mean. Okay, fine.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:30.400]   No, it'll be interesting to see though, because if I were any outside executive who has brought
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.520]   into Apple, I would want to have that conversation of like, well, what happens if this doesn't work
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.920]   out, right? Because whether it's somebody who flames out like Browett, who is the head of retail
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.200]   for a little while, and he left very quickly, or even something like Angela Arrens, who
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.920]   clearly, you know, she put in some time, but it was also not a long-term thing.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.640]   They, and I think they both knew it. You can't even stop.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.520]   So if I'm this, if I'm, if I'm the,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:00.160]   Vesterly. Surface, I would say, yeah, how do I get compensated?
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.160]   I'm going to invest now. I want to invest now.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.000]   Because there's definitely a non-zero chance that it won't work out just because Apple is so
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.240]   peculiar and particular, and it's not about the people being a bad fit as much as it is that
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.840]   Apple is a tough fit for anybody. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.080]   But it's interesting. You look at Medtronic, which he, where she worked before,
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.360]   right in the right, the top, they're saying that they've got nine, they,
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.880]   nine percent of the workforce is unionized. I've got their global human rights and labor
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.280]   standards policy in front of me, and it explicitly has an under the human policy statement under
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   human rights under number one is diversity, inclusion, inclusion, fair treatment,
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.480]   freedom of course, labor, but also, well, freedom of association saying that
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.400]   basically explicitly, we're not going to, we're going to cooperate in good faith with their
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:49.760]   audience. They're also employees move to Ireland. They may have to say that now, right?
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:55.120]   Yeah. They're an Ireland. But this was, but this was a document produced just a year ago. So,
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.600]   I don't know that could, that could be, it could be, I don't know, I'm hoping that Apple is,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.280]   is aware of the fact that at least they will have to be grudgingly live in a world in which employees
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:10.480]   are not willing to believe that, oh, we're Apple sons and daughters and everybody, and they love
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.760]   us and they'll take care of us. And we don't need representation because we love Apple so much.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.720]   I hope that their acknowledging that this is not the world that they live in.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:23.920]   That was the company line and it was Deidre O'Brien who delivered that. So, yeah, maybe this is,
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:29.600]   that would be great. That's, that's hopeful. Maybe this is a shift in company policy, or at least
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.680]   while they were doing the search, they realized that that would be a valuable thing that hopefully,
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.400]   they're not going to hire someone who used to be the head of a labor union, but someone who
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.720]   knew how to accommodate people with unionized and non-unionized workforces would probably have
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:52.160]   been a positive. It's official. Apple is killing the CSAM photo scanning feature. They proposed it
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:34:00.560]   a year ago after a lot of Fuhreror, they decided to put it off. But now in Wednesday,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.480]   they were hoping we'd all forget it when they quietly. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Disappear.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.840]   Yeah. Actually, this is an old story. I don't know how this guy in here. This,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:15.360]   this happened last year with Craig Federighi. So I apologize. It got on my list, but that's
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:21.920]   a, that's an old. Just workflows. It's tricky. You think headline workflows? Maybe your,
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:25.520]   maybe your workflows look and say, wow, it's really slow. I wonder if I, would you like
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.840]   your random stories in December? Yeah. Let's go back into the chat. GPT wrote this one.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.920]   This one I know is new wired magazine reporting Apple and Spotify
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:43.840]   are scaring audio book narrators after a backlash, Spotify, positive arrangement that allowed Apple
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.480]   to train its machine learning models on their audio books. Yeah. Remember, Apple's offering those
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.480]   nice voices, those really sweet voices to people who can't afford to have a human narrate their
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:02.720]   voice. Well, their book, well, it turns out that's been trained on real people. Gary Furlong,
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:09.360]   you might know the name. He's a Texas audio book narrator. He learned of a clause in his contract
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:16.560]   between findaway voices, which is an audio book distributor and authors, which gave Apple the
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.760]   right to quote, use audio book files for machine learning training and models and then find a way
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.400]   was purchased by Spotify last summer. Oops. And then Spotify licensed these to Apple.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.240]   Yeah. This is, I mean, we talked about this a while ago and we're sort of like, this isn't
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.440]   taking the jobs of the, of the narrators, but the, in my mind, one of the huge questions in the AI
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.840]   is what, what did you train your model on? How did you train it? Yeah. And on the one hand,
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.080]   I think it's also actually kind of sleazy if the contract that they had their narrators
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:51.360]   sign said, we're not just buying your, your work on this audio book, we're buying your voice and
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.200]   we're going to take it away. Like, I think no reasonable person would imagine that that was
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.200]   what was going on here. And it's, it's really not cool because this could put them out of business.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:09.280]   This is where a union helps because SAG-AFTRA represents those artists, those book reading
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:16.400]   artists. I'm a SAG-AFTRA member along with screen actors and, and radio folks. They represent
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:25.360]   people who read books. They, they contacted the two companies and an email to members
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.360]   from SAG-AFTRA said that they had agreed to immediately stop all use of files for machine
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.360]   learning purposes for union members affected and that the halt covers all files dating back to the
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.440]   beginning of this practice. Thank you, SAG-AFTRA. The union is still working with Findaway
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.920]   toward a solution that recognizes the union's concerns such as safe storage of the recordings
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.320]   and data usage limitations and appropriate compensation. It's a contractual issue.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:55.360]   If you're going to, if you're going to let them use your voice, you're going to damn well get
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:00.560]   paid for it sufficiently so that, you know, it will make up for lost income down the road.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:07.360]   And this is a huge issue. A lot of actors, for instance, are getting, are finding that like,
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.280]   you work for Disney, there's, or other big studios are saying though, by the way, we have the right
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.640]   to build models of your voice. So the end use that model for whatever reason possible. So as
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.560]   a result, a job in which they would basically have to pay you to come back in the studio to
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:24.720]   loop dialogue would be, nope, we'll just have some intern type into a keyboard and then we'll have
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.720]   someone that, someone with control over your performance that is not you is not making choices,
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.960]   making choices that you rejected at the time. And also we're not going to pay you. So good,
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.400]   congratulations, both of the family. This is, you know, this is the beginning of a,
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.640]   it's going to happen with artists, it's going to happen with writers, it's happening across the
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.520]   board because you got to train these things in something, something a human created.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.440]   As terrible be it's, it's a lot more complicated than it once was because you could,
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.280]   there was a time where for some of these training models, you could say, well, no,
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.440]   we're not making a synthetic version of this one person's voice. We are using this as a data,
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.200]   as part of a data set of 2000 voices, just to learn what a variety of voices sound like so that
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.920]   this model can then synthesize brand new voices that didn't exist before and thus don't necessarily
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:22.320]   take away your specific job. However, however, now that it's a lot of a lot of AI researchers are now
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.840]   trying adversarial attacks on these models to see, is it possible to get this model to generate or
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.560]   regenerate data that was trained on and finding that no, actually, that is possible. It's not
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.600]   easy necessarily. It's not trivial, but it is possible once you establish that this,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.680]   these models are capable of reproducing an intellectual property that has copyright
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.880]   copyright protections on them. Suddenly, this looks like it's built on a pile of sand that has to be,
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.680]   has to be really defined on a legal basis soon before it can actually be used in any commercial
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:02.240]   setting. I think that the law professor consulted by Wired said actually, these guys are probably
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:11.280]   out of luck. Legally, Spotify and Apple are in the clear. Morally, that's another matter.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.680]   At some point, courts are going to have to weigh in on all this. There's lawsuits going on right
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:24.560]   now from Getty against stable diffusion. Artists, I'm sure we'll sue. This is going to end up in
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.200]   the courts, right? The hard part is that, again, we've talked about this before, that if they lose
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.080]   in court, the threat of court has kept a lot of people at bay, including Google and Microsoft,
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.320]   are kind of now forced into pushing it in because of the competition. But I think a lot of them
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.400]   stuck out, stayed away from it because of the legal ramifications of turning the AI on that
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:51.360]   they've had for a decade. If they lose these cases, it'll be game on.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:58.720]   That's the real brinksmanship here, is that those legal cases, if they set precedent,
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.280]   it gets really hard really fast to put that genie back in the bottle.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:09.600]   The hard part, I think, for narrators as well is that I've been listening to audiobooks since
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:17.520]   the late '80s when they were on cassettes and then CDs and then virtual. I cannot name a single,
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.360]   almost a single narrator, unless it was the author of the book. I'm like, "Oh, this was narrated by
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.200]   the author of the book." I think that that's the... No, some people can get really into it. I'm just
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:31.760]   saying that I listened to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books. It's kind of a wash as to...
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.920]   I don't pick a book of that narrator. I pick the book because of the author.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.520]   Now, I definitely have narrators that I don't like, and I definitely listen to a book and go,
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.240]   "Oh, that was a great narrator." I don't know if I'm in their fan club, though. I don't remember.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.520]   I have to go back and look at who was narrating some one book or another.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.080]   I think that there are definitely people who keep track of it, but I'm going to guess that
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.320]   for the most part, the vast majority of audiobook listeners don't know who they're listening to.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.520]   That's a huge problem. The AI starts to pick up because for me,
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.600]   if you gave me an AI read of... Now, admittedly, I don't listen to fiction.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.840]   So all I listen to is non-fiction.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.200]   Yeah, we fiction listeners do know who reads the book, and we select often books because it's
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.000]   the same narrator.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.680]   You had Dan Morin on Twitter a while ago. I don't know if you mentioned this to you, but like...
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:22.480]   He's got a great narrator.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.200]   He's got a great narrator, so great in fact that he has gotten so many audiobook sales
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.200]   from the fans of the narrator who have followed the narrator to his book.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.960]   Yeah. So it definitely happens in fiction, for sure.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.880]   We had Daniel Suarez on "Tryingulation" a couple of days ago.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.760]   His narrator, Jeff Gerner narrates all his books, and there are many Jeff Gerner fans out there.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.720]   Just follow the narrator.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.800]   Follow the... If you listen to Harry Potter and you heard Jim Dale read those books,
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.200]   very often you follow Jim Dale. It's because you listen to non-fiction,
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:54.240]   because you're right, Alex, non-fiction books, then they're either...
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:54.720]   More anonymous.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.760]   ...in a completely irrelevant...
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.680]   They're often they're terrible, to be honest with you, because they're not actors.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.080]   To do fiction, you got to act the parts. You got to act...
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.240]   And that's so it's a very different job.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.320]   But I think that non-fiction is a pretty large mass of books that are out there,
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:13.920]   and I think that that's going to be where you see the AI stuff really dig in
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.760]   is in the non-fictional area. I do agree that the fiction stuff is going to be
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.960]   continue to be humans for a long time, because it's just so hard to
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.880]   figure that out. It's a very pretty complex process, but I think in non-fiction and magazines,
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.640]   I think magazines are going to be all read to us pretty soon.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.280]   Well, and Apple went into this as we talked about a few weeks ago saying
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.080]   that this is for the stuff that can't afford a full-on audiobook production,
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.960]   because these are our little indie books with small sales, and you never make your money back
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.560]   if you did it, and it creates accessibility for people who prefer audiobooks.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.600]   I think that's true, and I think there's probably a path forward here, right?
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.640]   I think there's a scenario where Apple has said that they sort of proudly base it on a real human
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.400]   narrator and not a collage of narrators, but a human narrator.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.040]   And I think there's a scenario where for books like this, you pay for the rights,
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.640]   you work with a narrator, they know they're going to be training a model,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.800]   and then there's probably a royalty structure for using them, not only per use, but if something
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:23.040]   is a hit, that the voice of the book gets paid. And I know that's antithetical to businesses who
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.000]   just want to run a model for free and not ever pay a human being, but if they pay the human being,
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.960]   we could probably work this out. Yeah, it's only fun. The typical pay for reading a fiction
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.960]   audiobook is $5,000. It's not expensive. And I bet you a lot of work, too, by the way.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:44.240]   I bet you a lot of readers would say, "Hey, give me $500 and you can have my voice for that book."
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.800]   Just $500 a book, because I don't have to read it. I think you're some amount, but it's going to
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:57.360]   be a fraction of the full amount. But the logical issue, the logic thing here is that,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:03.760]   obviously, a real human recording, their voice has value, that voice has value, or else they
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.960]   wouldn't be trying to take it. If they thought that basing something on something that's completely
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.120]   synthetic was just as good, they would do that and not have to mess around with any of the
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:16.640]   legalities or any of the payments. So this is one of the things that we're just going to have to
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:21.840]   navigate. I do think that one thing that I absolutely are am in support of is that the ability,
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:27.360]   the idea that if any publishing platform can then, as it's publishing something to the web,
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.320]   as it's publishing something to a newsletter, as publishing or whatever else it is, is also
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:39.920]   simultaneously publishing it in audio for people who don't have the ability to read text for whatever
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.880]   reason. If that means that the table stakes for publishing is that everything is going to be
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.160]   available for people who don't have the ability to read text at that very, very elevated position
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:53.360]   that should happen. That's good. There's lighthouse for the blind, there's people who volunteer,
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:45:02.000]   they're time to read books. This is a good thing. I think that it's safe to say that AI generated
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:10.000]   text, art and narration is all, it's better than you'd expect, but it's not as good as the best
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:18.480]   humans can do. So I suspect the people who are great at this, just like great film actors or great
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:24.480]   artists will still be employed because what they do cannot be duplicated by a machine. And I don't
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.360]   know if that'll ever be possible. The challenge though is always what's the feeder system after
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:35.040]   that. It looks at once they age out, once whoever you have that is the best ages out, if there isn't
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.480]   the lower hanging fruit left anymore, there's no art for someone to get. People do art because
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.560]   they do art. I don't think you have to worry about people stopping to do art.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.560]   I would say that it's hard to get good at something unless you're getting paid over a decade to do
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.280]   it all the time. You don't have to worry about it on the sides. So you absolutely can. It's just that
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.440]   there's a feeder system that goes into that and you start doing free stuff for voiceovers,
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.960]   then you're doing work, but then you're getting to do it all day every day because you get paid
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   for it and that's enough to pay your bills. When you don't have that, you don't get those
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.440]   10,000 hours, you don't get the money on time it takes. Then we will lose out because there
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.640]   won't be great artists if that's the case. That's probably not true for fine art for painting
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:25.440]   because painters just paint for free free. Van Gogh didn't ever get paid. But it isn't the case
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.640]   probably for performers. Performers need a place to perform, as you say, to get better. There's a
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.960]   lot of performers that have a hard time making ends meet as well. It's normal. I think that's
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:42.080]   YouTube has given people a chance to perform for free. I mean, I would read books for free.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:45.680]   Rihanna just performed for free. Yeah, I don't understand why. That's crazy.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:52.080]   That's easy. That's an easy calculation. 100 million people. I'm sure she made it enough from
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:58.240]   Spotify to I hope. But Prince got paid. The weekend got paid. Right? I mean,
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:03.120]   didn't they? Do you think the NFL doesn't pay people to perform at the Super Bowl?
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.480]   My understanding is they don't pay people to do that. Wow.
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:12.800]   Yeah. You know, it's that you don't want to. You don't want to do it. They'll let somebody
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.360]   getting in front of 100 million people is valuable from a brand perspective.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:23.520]   Oh, it's just tour for free. Well, I mean, if you if you do the tours or what make money and
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.080]   what drives the tours is having the exposure. I get it. The exposure.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.920]   Super Bowl thing. So, you know, there's there's there's a there's a loss leader there. I mean,
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:33.760]   you think about how long she was up there and how many how much those ads cost per every 30 seconds.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.160]   It was probably a fairly easy gig for her, right? Yeah. Obviously, she didn't break down.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:42.320]   She's brave. She wrote those things up and down and up and down. That was scary.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:46.400]   pregnant pregnant. Yeah, pregnant. That's a flex. That's a flex. Yeah. Like I can do that.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.200]   I don't even need to be I don't even need to work out for this. I'm just kind of, you know,
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.320]   it's funny. That was that was the conversation that dominated the half time.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.880]   Super Bowl. She pranked it. She's pregnant. I know. I know. You're like, is it all anybody's
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.440]   talking about? But it was there was a lot of attitude there. I mean, she she can she doesn't
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:08.480]   need to move very much to to know and she didn't move very much. Yeah. Those guys in the hazmat suits
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:15.840]   we did all the moving Johnny Ives latest design. We talked about the clown nose for red nose day.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:22.720]   He is prolific man. If you don't have Steve Jobs holding Johnny Ive back man, he just cranks
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.400]   him out. Now the emblem for King Charles coronation.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:36.480]   To be the conversation of like of like I had we had Johnny. That's you know, like it was it was
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:43.840]   definitely like, you know, that's classic. When it came time to create the emblem for King Charles,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.360]   we had a few simple questions. I think I think it's mostly like,
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:53.520]   thistles what this is everywhere. Yeah. Thistles. Right. What is with all the thistles? Is that
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.160]   you know, you know, something you're highness? This is a once in a lifetime thing. Let's go for
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:04.400]   two color printing. I know, I know, I know, I'll get you angry at quotes. I'll get you four quotes
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.240]   before we put in the job. But it's good for the flag. Alex, I want you to have mid journey design,
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:15.840]   Chas the seconds or the thirds, whatever number he is. Chas three. Chas three. Oh yeah, the second
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:22.320]   guy. Trey. Yeah. Chas Trey. I want to see him. You mid journey version of that logo, Alex. I know
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.600]   you can do it. Chas trip, chucks trip, chucks trip, chucks.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.160]   It's good. Well, we're calling that now on. It's the royal hat. Well, obviously, Alex, you're not
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:44.480]   as down with the streets as I am. A new crown just dropped. Oh, anyway, this is according to a new
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:50.880]   page on the royal family's website. Wait a minute, even the royal family has to tell you about cookies.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:59.520]   Okay, royal family, I agree. The coronation emblem, which we'll feature throughout maze,
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:05.120]   historic celebrations, which by the way, every person in England is expected to contribute to
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:10.640]   in some more form or fashion, pays tribute to the King's love of the natural world. Oh, that explains
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:17.360]   the thistles depicting the flora of the four nations in the shape of St. Edward's ground.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:26.240]   So four nations, what Scotland, Wales, England, and Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland,
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.680]   clover for the Irish, right? Thistles for one of them. Scotland.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:38.560]   Scotland daffodils for England. I don't know. The emblem pays tribute to the King's love of the
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:45.920]   natural world. The rose of England, the thistle of Scotland, the daffodil of Wales, and the shamrock
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:52.160]   of Northern Ireland. I'm Scottish. That's why I noticed the thistles right away.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:58.000]   It is. It is pretty busy. I mean, they're very busy onto that.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.320]   It's like a tapestry. Yeah.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:06.080]   It's not a typically Johnny. It's not a Johnny. I have joint, honestly, I think.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.160]   I think good designer is working for the client and give the client what they want.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:17.200]   This especially when they have people headed. Yeah, that's true. Heavy. The head that wears
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:25.120]   the crown of thistles. You can download these. I'm sure they'll reproduce
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:29.280]   people in the business card. That's what I'm saying. I'm going to download all the emblem files.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.280]   Be sure to download the guidelines. Wait a minute. It's going to cost me money.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:44.000]   What? They're using some wet weed transfer dot com. Really? Is that owned by the Royal Trust?
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.520]   Emblem guidelines or over. Oh, there's a different one for the Welsh coronation.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:55.280]   Emblem. It gets coordinated more than one. Well, no, it's the same one.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:02.320]   But it's in Welsh. Oh, which means it's long. It's going to have long
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.160]   all the way around thing around. Not a lot of not a lot of vowels. Not a lot of
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:17.600]   autopostrophes. Ted Lasso season three, premier date has been set now at Apple. Are you all
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:24.400]   excited about that? A month. It's been one of March 15th. Yeah. New episodes they'll do as they
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:33.120]   often do three, what, two or three episodes up front and then weekly after that on Wednesday.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:36.400]   It's Wednesday drop. They usually do a Friday drop. They're doing a Wednesday drop.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:42.960]   Wednesday. Ted Lasso trying to stake out some ground there. 12 episodes. The newly promoted AFC
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.800]   Richmond. Oh, they've got they've got that spoiler. The idea for the. Oh, no, that's the end of season
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:56.080]   two. Yeah, but spoiler. Okay. So they got they got promoted. Spoiler for sorry. Faces ridicule.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:01.280]   That's not a spoiler as media predictions widely peg them as last in the premier. They got into
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.680]   the premier late good for them. They got good for them. Good for the fictional characters.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:14.720]   Anyway, there's a trailer. I can't play it because they'll take us down because last thing
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:18.160]   Apple would want us to do is promote them. The story here is that they thought they were going
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:23.280]   to get this last year and that they did a bunch of extra shoots and Jason Sudekas apparently,
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:27.600]   you know, he wants to do it right. I think he's maybe feeling the pressure a little bit of having
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:34.160]   such a high profile show and wanting to have it be exactly right. And so there were a lot of there's
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:38.400]   a lot of talk about when it was actually going to start really rolling out because they did.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:42.960]   Yeah, they did a bunch of extra stuff. I think they expanded the season. He owned for the IP of
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:49.920]   Ted Lasso, right? No, no, no, it's NBC, doesn't NBC. He did some of it before, but then they were in the
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:55.040]   NBC ads and then the show is produced by what Warner Brothers. So there's a lot of different
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.680]   ownership going on in here. So long as Hannah's in it, I don't care. They're all they're all there.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.600]   Yeah. They all know, I think everybody involved with Ted Lasso knows this is probably the thing
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.960]   they're going to be most associated with. Yeah. Yeah. In their careers, other than like Anthony
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.200]   Stewart had, you know, sure Buffy the Vampire Slayer maybe, but like basically everybody else.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.720]   Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the greatest TV show of all time. Of all time. I've heard. I've been
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.600]   told. I haven't seen it. I've heard it's good. It's really good. Run by a bastard. Yes. Well,
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.320]   I'm fortunate. Is it good now? Like, does it, did it age well? I just, you know, some of it did,
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.280]   some of it didn't, but in general, I think it is the model for a lot of the stuff that came after.
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:39.920]   Modern, still pretty great. Modern TV. Ted Lasso is not a cowboy show, despite its name.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.520]   No, it's about soccer. A sport that exists mostly outside the US.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:51.040]   Has it been? Not a lot. You're allowed to use your hands. That's how I remember it.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.280]   Foundation is getting another season. Yeah. Everything gets another season on Apple TV.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.520]   You get another season. I just want to see severance season two. That's all I can.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.640]   I think that's it. Did anyone finish foundation? No, not me. I did. John did.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.840]   Was it worth it? Yeah. Was it good? Yeah. I thought it was okay. It was superific.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.400]   I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. Every, yeah, the moments of dullness were punctuated
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.880]   by moments of excitement. Okay. There was some stuff I liked the, yeah, there was things I liked
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.560]   and things I didn't like. Yeah. Yeah. And then the problem was they were mixed together.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:30.320]   That's always the problem. It is always the problem. They know that. That's why they don't
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.400]   like say, oh, skip this episode. This is the boring episode. We put the exciting thing to the next episode.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:42.640]   They should. Imagine that. Yeah. Okay. I think that's every story that I want to do.
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:51.040]   Is there a, I guess that's it. Is there anything, anything else anybody would like to add to this
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:56.400]   before we get to our picks of the week? I am going to be a little bit more arrogant at the top
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.120]   of these shows. We keep saying all this note. There's nothing to talk about. Everyone's going
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:02.640]   to be bored, but then we, we somehow managed to find a full docket of things to talk about.
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:08.240]   Usually, usually the stuff like the, the, the, the, the, the, the island of misfit toys stories,
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.040]   the ones that necessarily would necessarily be the top of the list, but there's a new
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.840]   iPhone being released. Yeah. Honestly, I say that firmly with tongue and teeth, because that,
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.720]   but that's hard to talk about. So I think every show is a gem here. None of the show,
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.240]   we wouldn't bother doing a show if it weren't going to be great. I would just go home. I don't
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:34.160]   need this. With your charisma. Almost your Carlo Esposito there. What do you want from me?
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.480]   I don't need this. I'm going to, I'm going to take my Moscow mule and get the hell out of here.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:47.520]   That's all. I'm, I'm, I'm out of here. Call me out of here. Before we get to our picks, please,
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:54.160]   folks, I'm in all seriousness now, we need your help. How would they do this on, on PBS?
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.000]   The, the work we do here is so very important, I think, to so many people.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:08.320]   And some of them can't afford to help us, but you can, you should. Is that, is that,
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.680]   is that enough guilt? I'm laying on you. So here's the deal.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.640]   Maybe you've seen stories in Axios and elsewhere saying podcasting's over.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:22.480]   Maybe you saw the fact that Spotify pretty much fired everybody who bought all those podcasts
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:30.400]   last year because it didn't work out. Advertisers are leaving in droves because, you know,
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:37.600]   seven million on a Super Bowl, they don't got a lot left. We really rely on you, our listeners,
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.000]   to keep this ball rolling. So I think, first of all, before I even say what I'm going to say,
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.880]   I want to thank all the people who have joined club to it because 6,000 strong, that's fantastic.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:56.080]   But about 700,000 people listen to our shows every month, 700,000. That means we're not even
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:03.200]   getting 1% of you. So what I'd like to do is get that number up. If you would, now here's the deal,
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.440]   I'm going to tell you upfront, it's seven bucks a month. And you're going to say, that's a lot
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:11.200]   of money, Leah. What do I get for seven bucks a month that I'm not already getting? Well, yeah,
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:15.120]   you get all the shows you get already, but you get them without ads. That's a start, right?
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.320]   Add free versions of all the shows. You also get shows that we do not put out in public. Now,
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:25.280]   we put out occasional episodes of Hands-On Macintosh with Michael Sargent, Hands-On Windows
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:30.880]   with Paul Thoreau. We put those out on occasion on YouTube, but there's many, many more. The
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:38.160]   entitled Linux Show is also exclusive to the club. So is the Gizfiz. So you get extra content
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:43.520]   because the club pays for it. These are shows that don't have advertising, can't get advertising
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:50.160]   because frankly, they're just not good enough. So we want to enforce you to listen. No, that's not
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.240]   right. They're very good shows, but they just don't have the audience yet. They're brand new.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:58.240]   Often what happens is shows like this week in space, which launched in the club, if you will,
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.200]   generate enough of violence. We can put them out in public and we do. So club members really
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:08.400]   are helping us start new programs. They're helping us keep the lights on. They're helping us keep
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:14.480]   people employed like John Ashley. He's not free. I just learned. He actually, we pay him.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:21.680]   So if you want to help us out, I'd sure appreciate it. Him? Yeah, we pay him. Both the Johns.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:28.560]   Handsomely, I might add. We also get there's more. Yes, for seven bucks a month, you also get access
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:33.600]   to the club to a discord, which is more than just a chat room around the shows. Oh, no, my friends.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:39.920]   This is a place you can hang with other geeks and talk about everything from ads to beer to
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:44.960]   anime and autos and book clubs and coding and comics fitness game.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:53.760]   Dogs in armchairs. Yes, there's a pet section sci-fi. We have the book club too with Stacy.
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:58.240]   There's a lot more going on in there. It's really a community of wonderful people.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:07.200]   There's no tote bag. We thought about tote bags. We got the design and we said, yeah, maybe no tote
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:18.000]   bags. Those are good though. It's a nice try. We really appreciate our club members. We love
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.920]   you and we love hanging out with you and then we'd like you to be part of the group. Okay,
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:30.160]   that's all there is to it. Go to twit.tv/clubtwit. Just a little belief. It's all it takes. Just
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:36.640]   believe my friends. Actually, it turns out we tried that with PG&E and they wouldn't. It didn't work.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:40.800]   Didn't work. Just believe we've paid the utilities.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:51.360]   That is fantastic. Joe made the Mr. Pruitt seal of disapproval. No, thank you, sir. Ooh,
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:58.000]   that is awesome, Joe. By the way, Joe, thank you for the mug. Joe sent me a mug too. Instead of
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.680]   we send you tote bags and mugs, you send us. That's how the club works. You send us tote bags and mugs.
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:11.200]   Seven bucks a month. We should sell this as a sticker. It's a good idea. I love it.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:22.960]   This is why the club's fun. Twit.tv/clubtwit, please. I beg of you, please.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.800]   All right. I think this would be a good time to get some pics of the week since Jason's since
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.320]   you're here. You're sitting right next to me. I think we should get you to start these things off
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:43.200]   here. Hey, have you heard about Twitter? They're kind of hard up for cash these days. Don't give
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:47.520]   them eight bucks. Give us seven bucks. I'm just saying. Yeah. And you know what you should do is
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:51.680]   if you still, like so much of my tech community has moved to Mastodon, but there are lots of
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.560]   things. Sports writers, a lot of journalists. They're still on Twitter. So I can't like complete
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.640]   the advantage. We're going to get your Elon fix 24/7. So give your three bucks to Jeff Johnson,
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.160]   who is a great Apple developer for his web browser extension tweaks for Twitter. What does it do?
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:12.800]   It's a Safari extension. It does among the many things that it does. It will hide all the promoted
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.600]   tweets in your timeline. Yay. In the web interface, which you're using now, right? Because they killed
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:23.440]   all the third party Twitter clients and a bunch of other things that it will just make disappear
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.480]   from the Twitter website. So you don't have to see them because they're in this financial trouble.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.440]   They've ramped up how many terrible sponsored posts that they have. How many pillows can one
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:41.600]   guy buy? So I recommend and Jeff Johnson makes some other great software, including a Stop the
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:47.200]   Madness, which is a sort of universal blocker of a lot of garbage that's on the web as a Safari
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:53.040]   extension. I think I use that one. Yeah. I like that. But it's definitely it's worth it. I use it.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:58.160]   It is it is great. I had it turned off and I didn't realize it and I went to Twitter.com and I
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.560]   Oh, no. And then I turned it back on. I updated it turned it back on and then all the terrible
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:10.720]   things went away. So if you need to be on Twitter and make it go away with tweaks for Twitter.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:16.480]   Yeah, tweaks for Twitter works in Safari and Chrome and Chromium based browsers.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.280]   It's a cross platform browser extension and there's a version for iOS too. I believe so. Yeah,
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:27.280]   you can get it everywhere if you're if you're forced to use the Twitter website $2.99 tweaks
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:32.240]   a bargain for Twitter. Mr. Alex Lindsey, you got to pick first there.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:37.200]   I do. I do. Yeah. So I, you know, I've talked about the fact that I don't really do
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:43.200]   laptops much anymore. I have a laptop, but it's not very useful. It's one of those old air Intel.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.440]   And so I needed some way to move my computer around it. I have a Mac studio. And so I got this.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:53.520]   I thought I had done it before, but I got this little case. Oh, look, it's so cute. It's like
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:01.200]   a little suitcase. And so this is the RL SoCo. It's a it's a it is a case for my Mac studio.
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.160]   And it's got like a little opening, which I keep one of my little link webcams and pieces in there
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:10.880]   and stuff. Yeah. And so so you can and I've got, you know, it's got a little area on the top here,
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:14.240]   but so if you think that you can't move your computer around, what I do is I have all my
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.600]   monitors and everything else set up in one place. I just put them in here. I have a whole bunch of
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:21.120]   monitors on the other side because I only take this to the office. I don't really go anywhere else.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:27.440]   Anyway, so, so anyway, it's a great little case. And it actually, you know, I'm using it all the
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.000]   time. Anytime I go to the office and I need to work, I just take my Mac studio with me,
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.640]   just because the my willingness to buy a laptop to do it, the problem is that it's hard to find
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.000]   one that was as powerful as what I'm using. I usually use almost all the ports. And so I looked
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.360]   at laptops and I just said, I'm just going to move this back and forth. So it's a nice little
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:51.200]   briefcase. It's like, it's kind of cool. Yeah. It works. You know, it's again, it was it was one
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:59.520]   of those things that I when I do the gray matter, gray matter show, it is it needs the studio. I
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:05.360]   can't do it on a Mac mini. And so because I'm doing memo live and I'm bringing a bunch of inputs and
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:10.480]   doing a bunch of things and I just needed to move the studio around and it has it's turned out
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:14.800]   really well. And you got to assume there's a there's a there's a monitor where you're going,
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:20.880]   I guess, right? You don't carry this to the office. You know, I don't I am I'm going on a trip after
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:27.440]   today. I'll be gone until next week when I'm here. But I I'll have a laptop. I'm not taking the
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:32.880]   studio with me that way. But I usually just assume I'm not going to do very much. I'll fill out forms
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:38.160]   and stuff like that. I I don't really do real real work on what graphics work on on a laptop
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:44.400]   anymore. They make one for the mini as well as the studio. So you can choose your size by the
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:50.400]   catchily named R L. Soco. Yeah, I know it's the other way. It's a worst name, but it works out
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:55.360]   really well. It's super solid. Again, I've been using it for over a month now. And I'm really
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:59.920]   happy with it. And and again, I if you're going back and forth, if you're being forced to go back
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:04.480]   to the office, and you're going back and forth and you started to buy Mac minis and studios instead,
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.920]   and now you have to go into the office, you can just have a monitor in the office and a monitor at
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:12.800]   home. And you just set it down and plug it in. And this is a little case that needs all work. So,
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:18.400]   yeah. I don't know why Amazon now puts up a sidebar showing me what I put in my cart
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:24.240]   at one point years ago. I just remembers it once they're once it bring it back. You know,
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:29.440]   you like that chocolate bar when you bought it for your mom in 2020. Maybe you'd like to buy it again.
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:38.800]   What the hell Amazon? Amazon has really become just this. It's it's like a shopping mall or
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:46.800]   something. What's it's got something called clinic. What's that? It's got a clinic. It was on clinic.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:50.800]   They're also in your drugstore. Oh, health care is a massager way.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:56.880]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going towards services oddly. How long before this title bar has
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:02.400]   everything you could ever want to buy ever last year. Yeah. Last year.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.960]   It already happened. But you might not get the one you ordered. That's that's the problem.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:12.320]   Everything you might want to buy. I got it like it. So I went online. I wanted some shoe polish.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:17.200]   So I ordered four different colors of shoe polish came from four different sellers at four different
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.960]   dates. It's a really big box with a little thing.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.760]   Yes. Every once in a while, I get the same.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:29.040]   And it's like someone ran out of boxes like they. It was unclear that there was four different
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:35.920]   marketplace sellers selling one little thing of shoe polish. I kept telling these. I can't
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:44.080]   polish the shoes until they all come. I'm waiting. Yeah. Annie and I call you tap top this thing
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:49.040]   off with your pick of the week here. You're the top. This is for this is for people who want to
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:55.760]   get some class on the iPhone musical wise speaking. Oh, I'm not I do I know Apple music is going to add
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:02.240]   classical party day. I'm fine. They bought them any day now. Yeah. There's supposedly like
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:10.080]   on 16.3 people who like do this sort of thing took apart the binary they found references to
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:14.880]   like messages to an app called Apple open this open this this music the song in Apple classical
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:21.520]   music and blah blah blah. So maybe imminent with not with a capital M but there's there's there's
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:27.280]   there's they bought the company in 2021. They promise that they'd have the the app in 2022 as
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:33.760]   still in 2023. Okay. Fingers crossed. But if you there is I just recently discovered a really
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:43.440]   interesting little niche music player called TEMPSO T-E-M-P-S-O, which is interesting optimized
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.840]   Spotify and Apple music player for classical music. It is again it's very niche. It's not going to
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:55.840]   take the place of your of the actual like Spotify app or the Apple music app. But when you do it,
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:00.080]   it does the sort of thing that you're we're hoping to see in an Apple classical music app,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:06.320]   which is like if you want to see Beethoven's third symphony, it's not necessarily that I want
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:11.520]   to see like the three most popular ones. It's like I want to see all the ones you have and they say,
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:15.760]   Ooh, what's what's what's the version that was directed by this person like? What's the version
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.840]   that was performed by this orchestra like? If it's like an opera recording, it's like you've got
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:28.800]   my favorite favorite opera of Lucia de Lamelemore and it's like the you listen to it performed by
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:34.080]   six different sopranos and it's six different versions of that character. And this app does one
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.600]   of the things that does very well is stuff like that. So you do a search, you do link it to your
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.720]   Spotify account or your Apple music account and it will be a complete front end to that database.
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.720]   And we'll present you a list of it makes it very, very easy to navigate between different versions
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:50.960]   of a certain piece of music or to drill down on here is one musician and here are all the different
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:57.680]   pieces of work they did. Now, it's free because it is kind of a labor love project for the past
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:01.920]   couple of years of three column three developers that aren't making money off of it. They would
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:07.520]   like you to donate money to help to help like fund the support of this app. But it's not as though
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.440]   this is a data harvesting operation or they're trying to sell the service someplace else.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.480]   As a result, it's kind of quirky and kind of limited. I'm surprised that if there is a way
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.960]   to say, wow, you found me a really interesting version of this area, I would love to add it to
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.120]   my Spotify list. No, you can't add it to your Spotify list. So okay, well, obviously, you let
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:30.480]   me open this in Spotify. Well, no. So what am I going to do? Well, you're probably going to
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:36.000]   I'm it's a standalone app. Do you open it within Spotify or by the way, you should tell the
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.880]   developers Spotify spell with an F because it says spot a T on the website. But okay.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:47.360]   Again, again, it's a couple of people. It's a couple of people. Yeah, I love this idea. I
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:52.320]   downloaded immediately because I'm it's killing me. The Apple has and Spotify, I presume, too,
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:56.960]   has all of the music. It's just not as you point out, the discovery is not well done.
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.400]   Yeah, you link it to your link up to your account. And I think it basically opens streams
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:06.320]   through Spotify. So I think you obviously need to have the app.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.360]   This is great. This is great. So it's like, it's that it's that it's
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:14.960]   Yeah, this is nice. I like what they're doing. It's sort of thing. Think of it as an alternative,
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.840]   like search and navigation and discovery app for this existing service. Yeah. I would love
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:25.520]   something that was that acted kind of like a kind of like an Apple classical music app where I
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.680]   never have to leave it. But it's better than nothing. And it does scratch that itch that you have with
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.080]   kept classical music, which is that I want to basically navigate. I want to see all the different
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.400]   ways that people interpret this one piece of music and find the one that really, really gets
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:43.040]   to me on an emotional level. And this will help you do that. That's free. That's cool. I want to
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:46.640]   give money because I think this, you know, I don't know when Apple's going to get prime fun.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.240]   I got but this is this is the kind of thing prime, fun. It would do. And this is the kind of thing
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.000]   Apple should do. But now that this is out, probably Apple says, well, we don't have to do it anymore.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.680]   No, no, no, you do. You still have to do that. You made a promise. You made a promise. You told
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:09.680]   us you told us you do this. It is called temposo T erm, sorry, temp so temp so they left out the
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:18.640]   T E M P S O dot com temp so nice. Thank you. I am I installed immediately. Yeah, I appreciate that.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:24.480]   Wow. We have come to the concluding moments of this show. I'm sad to say, but I do thank you,
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:30.720]   Jason Snow for driving up here. It wasn't far. It wasn't far and you have a nice light computer.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.120]   You can take with you. That's right. So I very portable. It's great to be here. Nice to be here
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.800]   in person. So great to see you in person. See you in the home gang. See you in the way for the ride
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.080]   home. I appreciate it. All right. Yeah. Jason is at six colors dot com. If you go to six colors
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:49.520]   dot com slash Jason, you'll see all the umpteen podcasts he hosts or participates in and all the
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:56.320]   other places he writes like Mackerel. Follow me on Mastodon. J. Snell at Zeppelin dot flight.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.480]   By the way, we were talking about that because Shelley Brisbane was on Twitter on Sunday.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.760]   And I said, what the hell is Zeppelin flights? And she says, well, it's Jason. It's Jason.
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:11.280]   Okay. Cause then and then we go to a discussion about your ships because of that. I can't resist
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:17.120]   a novelty top level domain and dot flights was there. So Zeppelin dot flights just begging to be.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:23.360]   Yeah. That's awesome. That's it. So you're at Jason at J Snell at J Snell. Yeah. I think you find
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.720]   me. I mean, you find me following and I'm on. Yeah. I was actually a tweet at social and it
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:34.240]   forwards to my. Oh, my other thing too. Yeah. Okay. Cool. You didn't spell Zeppelin right though.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.360]   How many else in Zeppelin? There's an E. Yeah. So if you've led Zeppelin,
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.720]   top. But that's me. So should I add you if I'm already following you on? I mean,
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:48.160]   Twitter social learn, whatever it is. There he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:52.400]   Yeah. Just check me out on on. There's a dog. There's Maisie and some horses.
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.440]   It's true. Then you'll know you're at the right spot. No one else can have Maisie and some horses.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:04.400]   No, no machine learning. Stay away. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate you're making the trip.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.360]   Thank you, Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH next? Next Thursday, 1230, go to
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.000]   WGBH news.org to stream it live or stream it later or stream any of the previous
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.960]   appearances I've done. Talk about tech on WGBH Boston public radio. I'm quickly rushing
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:24.880]   to hover.com to see if I can register balloon.flights.
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:31.680]   Thank you. It's always a pleasure, Andy. Thank you. Mr. Alex Lindsey,
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:38.160]   office hours.global. The Alex's attempt to take over the universe.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.960]   With one simple show, at least entertain it. So, Super Bowl ads on the.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.360]   We talked about Super Bowl graphics. We get kind of geeky. So we don't really talk about the game.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.240]   We just talked about like the lower thirds and, you know, like, let's talk about the important.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.160]   I should have watched. I tell you, there's been a huge revolution in graphics over the last 10
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:06.560]   years. You look at old football games, even from the 90s, and they look so bad. He fell.
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.640]   Is what made the difference. He fell. We're the string that actually starts to buzz when the
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.840]   camera on comes on. Yeah. There was that big moment where they realized that instead of having
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:21.680]   to do a ever crop everything in four by three because they were still broadcasting it in standard
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.440]   F of four by three, they said, Oh, yes, from now on our standard death broadcast will be letter
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.440]   boxed and they embraced 16 by nine and made such a difference because there was this whole
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:34.960]   side of the broadcast. All this place we could play. Nice. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So it's,
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.200]   yeah, we had a good conversation there. We had a great conversation yesterday with
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:46.320]   View Technologies, VU Technologies. They make virtual sets, you know, so the LED wall sets. But
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:52.560]   the story is so good. He's like, they were in they were in COVID. Their business was going south.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.320]   And they were like, we're going to make an LED wall, but we don't can't afford an LED wall. So they
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:01.040]   literally ordered the raw components from China, like, you know, and figured out how to build their
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:06.800]   own LED wall. Wow. So it was a, it was a great story. Is that bookshelf behind him real or fake?
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:11.680]   I think it's real. I think he was actually somewhere, but you can't tell. We don't know. You
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:15.760]   don't know. That's the, that's the beauty of it. But if you want to do the Mandalorian in your
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.400]   living room, now you can see, I thought you meant Alex's behind Alex and I think that's pretty
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.280]   much that's got to be fake. Right. Like he's an Alex's part of a screen somewhere. Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:32.400]   I'm in, I'm in Taipei. Yeah, absolutely. But yeah. And by the way, Leo, I did, I did do some
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.560]   mid-journey renderings for you. So we started working on some of the coronation stuff. We got,
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:42.880]   Oh, look at that. That's much nicer. We have this one. It's made out of metal. And it has the
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:51.600]   word. We're right on it. I love text and in the journey. I love it. I know, I know. It's like,
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:54.960]   and we will give you random text. Like it's just like, it's just like, it's, it's,
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.240]   let's see. Garb, like, here's another one. That's got some. It's got some niggas and then
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:05.200]   Shrek and then earlier, earlier, earlier, I may have, we may have talked about something that I
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.760]   thought would be fun. And so I'd put in Alex, Nicole back, um, or not Alex and Apple, Nicole,
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:15.040]   back. So there we go. Apple, your apple, Nickel bag, another apple, nipple,
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:21.840]   one. Those apples are not apples. Pumpkin like, pumpkin like, I know. That's a good one. Oh,
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:27.920]   yeah. Put that on a black t-shirt right now. Let's make that. That's our thumbnail for the
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:31.680]   show for sure. So people who are listening, ladies and gentlemen, I've just chosen my lower
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:40.000]   back tattoo. Thank you. You just have to imagine if you're listening to the audio, it's Nickelback
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.880]   and Apple together at last. And I'll send it up here. Thank you. And Alex will perform free at the,
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:50.640]   at the coronation, if you ask him. Yeah, it's gonna be crazy. I'm gonna be crazy. I'm gonna
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.280]   just, had somebody there just putting up mid-journey images throughout. Yeah, exactly. I'm just having
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.120]   a journey. Just going up, just give me a couple screens and I'll just, I swear to God, you could
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:03.680]   be the next light show. You could be the future like, just mid-journey crap going on in the background.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.680]   You know, I'm doing a keynote document right now. I got to do this, this slide deck. And I started
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:11.600]   building and I was like, I can't find the images that I want. I wonder how many of these I can do
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:17.040]   it in mid-journey. It turns out all of them. All of them. Like, so, like, all these things.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:21.200]   Really good. I don't know if you become a prompt master. I think you're the first master.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:27.680]   So good. Key to the operation is over a flat white background. Then you just remove the
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:31.440]   background. So you just do, I want this object or this person over a flat white background.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:38.240]   And you end up with something that you can remove background on in a. Easily in a keynote. Yeah.
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:44.960]   So, so, so super useful. Yeah. More keynote tips next week with Mr. Alex Lindsey. If you want
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:51.120]   to hire him, he's available for your next rock and roll show or your next streaming event,
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:58.080]   090.media. And if you're interested, absolutely highly recommend office hours.global.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:03.920]   Just always worth checking in. There's so much stuff. So much. I want to listen to audio pathology
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.600]   tomorrow. I don't know what that is, but it sounds good. It's really looking. It's some of our
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:11.360]   audio folks are going to be talking about when something goes wrong with your audio. Here's how
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.680]   you, here's how you identify what the problem is and here's how to fix it. And, and here's what,
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:20.400]   so it's, it's usually a pretty good. And the live sports BTS is that with somebody who works in a
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:24.960]   truck. So, so that's happening in our after hours. That's not happening in office hours right now.
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:28.480]   And or it will be on Friday, but it's happening right now in after hours. And then we're going to
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:34.000]   have a second hour talking about it. So someone is, um, Jeff Keithley is actually doing an event,
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.960]   and you get, you get to kind of see what he's doing in that event. And so in the after hour,
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.560]   you can sit there and just listen to comms and watch the, watch them work on it. And then they'll
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:46.320]   talk about it more specifically on Friday. So it's pretty, it's going to be a great, great hour.
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:47.440]   Love.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:53.360]   Thank you, everybody for joining us. We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:59.680]   Eastern time. That's 1900 UTC. You can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv or listen live.
[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:06.400]   There's audio and video streams. You can also chat live at IRC.twit.tv club members can chat
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:13.040]   in the discord. We watch both. So comments from, from both are appreciated. After the fact on
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:17.360]   demand versions of this show and all the shows we do available at twit.tv. In the case of this
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:26.080]   shows, twit.tv/mbw. You can also go to twit.tv's YouTube channel, youtube.com/twit,
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:31.760]   @twit, I think. And when you do that, you'll find links to the Mac Break Weekly show on YouTube
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:36.080]   and all the other shows. Each of the shows has their own YouTube channel. Of course,
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:39.520]   while you're at the website, you might also want to subscribe. That's probably the best way to get
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:46.000]   the show. Pick your favorite podcaster, pocket casts, overcast. I think Marco Arman said he wanted to
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:50.080]   be on the show. So we'll try to get him on the 28th. He's great. We'll see. You're not going to be
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.960]   here on the 28th. I'm out the next two weeks. Yeah. Yeah. Where you going? New Zealand. Oh,
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:21:00.320]   that sounds like fun. Do you own sheep? Not yet, but that seems to be lively.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:03.760]   That's one of the plan. Yeah. What's weird is Richard Campbell, who is the
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:08.960]   co-host on Windows Weekly, has dual citizenship and own sheep in New Zealand. So he might be
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:12.720]   down there at the same time. I think he's going on his way. Yes. Look for Richard. He's hard to miss.
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:17.440]   Okay. I'll look for him amid the sheep. Thank you, everybody, for being here. Now,
