[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.320]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 12 for October 24, 2006.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   Smoking.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:44.360]   Well, I don't know how we could top last week,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.200]   but we're going to try.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and sitting
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.880]   in for the beautiful, the talented, the brilliant,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.280]   the ever so lovely Emmer MacArthur, Alex Lindsay.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.600]   I don't want to set up.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800]   Oh, man.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.000]   Guess we can live with that.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.040]   But here I am.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.200]   I'm wearing a dress.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.280]   Where were you last week?
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.880]   Were you in Detroit again?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.240]   I was in-- no, I-- where was I last week?
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.120]   Oh, I was in LA.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.600]   I was in LA.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.840]   I speak at every month at the motion graphics LA.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.280]   So I was--
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.800]   Oh, cool.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.140]   All right.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.280]   --speaking there.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.720]   Scott Born is also here.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   Actually, Scott and Merlin are down in town, visiting--
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.880]   We're all together here.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.720]   We're in the Pixel Core offices here,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.480]   and we're all sitting around the table.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.320]   And we do have a picture of you, Leo.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.680]   OK, that's good.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.800]   If you're my space, be--
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.960]   Leo, I'm sitting right next to where you would be sitting
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.880]   if you were here.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.640]   I will never be there.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.600]   It's just so you know.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.440]   Don't get your hopes up.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.640]   Scott Born--
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.120]   --is iLifeZone.com.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.880]   Someday that's going to be on Twit.tv.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   I haven't gotten around to doing that.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.160]   I will do that.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.040]   Any minute now.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.720]   But it's not one thing.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.240]   It's another.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   Oh, there's just a million.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.560]   I need a punch list, like a contractor,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.640]   and I can just ignore--
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   Well, you've had--
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.880]   --the one contractor.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.480]   In fact, if I were a contractor, I'd be in the Bahamas
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.680]   right now.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.520]   You've had a few challenges, though, so we understand.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.320]   Yeah, that's what we understand.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.440]   Also, of course, with the podcastingtricks.com
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.800]   and a voice for hire.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.520]   That's me.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.600]   That's me.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.000]   And from 43folders.com and 5s.com.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.680]   It's Merlin Mann, soon to be host of his own fabulous television
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   show on the Twit Network.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.080]   You're kidding.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.040]   I think so.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   I've been told that.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.320]   It was--
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.040]   So I'm going to be on it?
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560]   Was I misinformed?
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.320]   Like Humphrey Bogart?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.000]   I wish--
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.360]   I wish machine-formed.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.080]   I came here for the waters.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's awesome.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I've always wanted a TV show.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.560]   This is great.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   Oh, good.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   This is a--
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.400]   I was going Leo.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.720]   How's your--
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   It's just been nominated.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.520]   Oh, I can say Leo is what Karimasen go menisai.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   Mm.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Deskaw.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.240]   Wakaremashita.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.760]   Anjinsai.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.960]   Yay, doi tai shimashita.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   OK.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.280]   Let's--
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.000]   Did he just ask you not to touch his mustache?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.500]   I did.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.520]   He said, don't touch the stash, baby.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.680]   Big story is actually quite a few big stories.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.080]   The big one that broke today, Apple Slips Dreams,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   an update to the MacBook Pro, Core 2 Duo.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.760]   The Merum is in the Macam.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.520]   With up to 39% speed increase.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.880]   Esterisk, your mileage may vary.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.720]   The mileage vary I usually find is the most important part
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   of that.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   I have to say, it is a much faster chip.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.640]   I mean, Core 2 is a faster chip.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   Core Duo is a faster chip.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.520]   But Core 2 is supposed to be much faster.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.320]   I have to admit the thing I'm most excited about
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   is that an 800 port, it's been a real pain in the neck
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.920]   for me to only have a 400 port in the MacBook Pro that I have.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.880]   Do you use 800 stuff?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.920]   I have a whole bunch of portable 800 drives.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.600]   Now you're the one who bought that stuff, huh?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.120]   I was the one who bought that stuff.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.160]   Because nobody else, did anybody else use it?
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   I got a ton of 800 firewire hard drives.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   They're faster.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   They're faster.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   You move in big files.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   Are they really faster?
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   Yeah, they really are.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yes, Leo see, there's the 400 fire.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   No, no, yeah.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   You could say that the 800 specs.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   But that's me.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   They're definitely faster.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.560]   You can test the throughput.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   It's definitely faster.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.680]   So I'm glad about that.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.480]   I'm also glad about the memory bump,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   because you could only get up to two gigs in the old MacBook
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   Pro.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Now you can go to three.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.000]   And what I found very interesting was that the baseline
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.880]   configuration with these new machines is two gigabytes.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   It's two?
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   Oh wow.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   Two gigabytes.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   That's the way it comes.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   You really do need it though.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   Yeah, you do.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   I'm on a MacBook Pro that one of these not 39% faster ones.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   Gosh, I feel like I'm really pushing a lot of it.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.840]   Well, I mean, of course, I still have that key chain problem
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.320]   from last April.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   Oh, we'll fix that.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.240]   But you know what you do with the key chain?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.040]   You throw it out.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.800]   And then you just start over.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.640]   Yeah, but I've got some stuff in there you can't.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.880]   Yeah, I've got stuff in there for the late '70s.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   I don't want to get rid of.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.240]   But no, I think this is--
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.360]   I mean, so the 800 though, the 800 Firewired,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.320]   use that for pulling down video.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.680]   No, I just have a lot of--
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   when I had my last laptop, I have a bunch of 800 portable
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.000]   drives.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.320]   So there are bus power, these little ones
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   you can put in your pocket.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.160]   And so I just have a bunch of these drives that are all
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.640]   800s.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.440]   I don't want to get rid of them.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   And the thing is--
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   Well, you could use it with a 400 port and an adapter, right?
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah, but you just-- suddenly, I have to make sure I have all--
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.120]   what you have to have is I have to have these--
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.080]   because they don't have the little portables.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.640]   Only have 800 connections.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.120]   And so I need to make sure I have my special little cord that's
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.160]   at 400 on one side and 800 on the other.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.600]   And I can't just grab any 800--
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   we have-- we're a wash of 800 cable in here.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.040]   So it's easy because all of our drives were 800,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.240]   because they're a lot faster.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.840]   And so I do admit that the 800 in the past has been buggy.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.120]   So there have been times when drives don't show up
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.840]   and everything else.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.440]   And so the 400 was good.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320]   It just said it was nice to have both of them.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.640]   You know, it's kind of cool on this.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.920]   Is it the same video card as the old one?
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.360]   It's the ATI mobility Radeon--
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.040]   1600.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.800]   Is that the same as in the MacBook Pro?
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.520]   That was the same one that was in certain models
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.040]   of the original--
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.160]   So it's what the high end MacBook Pro would be.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.000]   Right.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.840]   I bought one of these today, a 17-inch LEO.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.400]   And--
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.880]   You did?
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.280]   Are you ready?
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.480]   Oh, you know me.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.760]   I can't help myself.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.560]   I just got the 100 gig ATA drive, though,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.080]   because I like the 7200 RPM speed.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.120]   You're going to put a faster one in.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.320]   I'm going to just-- you know, I'm
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.120]   going to connect to my other stuff--
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.040]   Oh, and a sternal drive.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.280]   And--
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.720]   It's nice because it drives a 30-inch display.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.240]   It does.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.960]   But the thing is, is that with tax, I'm over $4,000.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   Right.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.960]   Because I got everything you could get.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.720]   So it's over $4,000 with AppleCare and the whole nine yards.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.080]   But--
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.480]   You really buy that AppleCare?
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.600]   Every single time.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.040]   Everybody.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.080]   I never--
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   You did too.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   --over to lose money.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.120]   I never lose money on AppleCare.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120]   Why?
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.760]   If you call Apple without AppleCare,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   let me tell you--
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   You will understand exactly what it's like to be--
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.920]   Who calls Apple?
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.640]   --left handed red headed step forward.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   Help.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.440]   Well, my thing is, is that I have to--
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.320]   I will admit that I travel a lot,
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.160]   and I'm a little rough with my equipment.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.440]   But if you break the screen, you can't just say,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   oh, look, the screen broke.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.840]   We need a new one.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.320]   If you break the screen, but I'll tell you,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.080]   I get those little white things on my screens, you know,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   fairly often.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.520]   They'll replace that?
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   They'll just swap that right out.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.880]   And they won't do it under the warranty?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.040]   If it's in the first year.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.640]   But this is-- it usually occurs two years, two and a half
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.140]   years in.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.760]   You got all these things with your screen.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.320]   Isn't right.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.820]   How about you?
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.560]   I will do that.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.520]   Do you buy that AppleCare?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   I've never bought AppleCare.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.040]   Me neither.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   But now that you guys have said it,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.920]   no, I never buy it.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.720]   That's a big problem.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.840]   It's a profit center for them.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.400]   I don't buy it.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.000]   But I'm sure not with me.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.800]   One trip to the repair shop will pay for the AppleCare.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.720]   And what I find is that every time I've bought it,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.040]   and I've bought it on almost every--
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.440]   It's just--
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   --and I've never gotten.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.040]   It's paid for itself.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.880]   The smart thing to do, though, would be to wait a year
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.160]   and buy it in the last day of the first year, right?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.280]   Because it's just extending that warranty.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.360]   You can buy at any point.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.960]   You buy at any point after--
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.640]   You can buy it at any point.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.120]   But I will tell you this.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.840]   Even if you're within the warranty period,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   and you call Apple for help, they start immediately asking
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.560]   if you've got AppleCare.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.440]   And if you don't, you get to go on the line that's
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.800]   like seven hours long looking for help.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.760]   If you've got AppleCare, they'll just take care of you.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.920]   And you can take your back MacBook Pro in, drop it off.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.080]   And you know what happens every time?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.800]   They just give you a new one.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.240]   It's amazing.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   So you end up with basically a new computer.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.320]   I've never used it, and I don't intend to use it.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.680]   I'll buy it for you.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.360]   I will say that I never use anybody else's.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   If I go to Compu, I say, I never buy it.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.160]   And that's the only one that I buy with my stuff.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.080]   I can buy with my stuff.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   Apple's sick of fans.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.640]   No, sick of fans.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.960]   As I said, if I hadn't--
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.600]   I think I'm not even sure if this is a compliment to Apple.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.480]   The fact that I break their computers off
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.320]   in enough that AppleCare is worth it.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.840]   I know.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.240]   I'm just lucky, but I've never broken.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.520]   I've never had to bring one in.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.640]   The only times I've had my daughter and my wife
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.240]   were fighting over her iBook, and it somehow magically
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   flew across the room.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.640]   And the screen broke.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.080]   But AppleCare wouldn't have protected it.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.720]   Wouldn't have done anything about that.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.560]   It depends on how good a lie you get to come up with.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.320]   No, I don't think that's not.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.640]   No, it was bad.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.320]   As bad as I've manufactured, the screen just busted.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:23.240]   I've never had a laptop survive three years without me
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.200]   having to have a major--
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.920]   Well, maybe either, but I just get rid of him.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.440]   Oh, yeah, he doesn't like Corey Doctor O'Roc.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.560]   Corey goes through like one a week.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.200]   Well, you know, he does.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.400]   He buys them by the pen.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.840]   He buys them by the pen.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.640]   12 packs.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.920]   Yeah, he buys them by literally by the pen.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.560]   Well, he does, and he does need like R-Sync
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   too at the same time.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.320]   I actually have been considering--
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.200]   I was so funny that you said that I've been actually
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   thinking about--
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.800]   You know, I should R-Sync two of them together.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.480]   I should buy two at the same time.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.320]   So how much more--
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.680]   How much--
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.800]   One more project like that.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.160]   How much--
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.720]   Scott was the AppleCare on that $4,000 book?
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.800]   It's like $300.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.280]   It's always probably the same.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.120]   I mean, you know, it's less than 10% of the computer.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   And--
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.840]   Well, when you can figure it that way.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah, well, for me, it just doesn't
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.280]   seem to make sense to say, you know, be pound--
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.240]   All right, well, I'll tell you what--
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   --and why it's in pound food.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.800]   This would be good.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   I'll tell you what, I will buy--
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.400]   right after we get off the year, I'll buy a new one too.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.080]   And I won't buy AppleCare.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.560]   You're going to buy one of the new MacBook Pros?
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.440]   Well, just for the experiment, yeah.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.720]   No, no, this is awesome, because that
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.360]   means the day after the price will go down.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.920]   You know, that's a lie.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.120]   That's a lie.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.520]   Just because I bought a cube, the day it was discontinued.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.800]   That's a lie.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.360]   Everybody thinks I do that.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.880]   And then three years from now lets you and I
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.440]   get together and compare notes.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.840]   OK, first of all, I won't have this computer three years,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.120]   because the next time they upgrade,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.440]   one I'll come out and buy that one.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.040]   Well, that's my point.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.560]   But--
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.520]   --I'll have peace of mind.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.160]   And you can transfer--
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.600]   you can transfer the AppleCare, which gives you better
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.120]   resets.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.320]   Do you ever sell your computers?
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.000]   I do.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.480]   All right.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.400]   Well, then I have--
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.000]   I don't.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.600]   I sell money, babe.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.240]   That's all right.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.400]   Well, that's worth a while.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   And it brings years before you can sell them on this.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.800]   I have my--
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.960]   I literally have my--
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   one person the company has one of my laptops.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.800]   The last four laptops I've owned, I have an old black one
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.720]   that is my key.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.040]   It's basically the front end for my iTunes.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.000]   It's all Wall Street.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.920]   It just does-- it's just my jute box.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   So it's got-- it's sitting on 80 gigs of music,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.440]   and it just jute boxes away.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.640]   It weighs as much as a toddler.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.680]   Well, yeah, but it's not on my desk.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.200]   And then I have another one to do.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.720]   Small top.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.480]   It's on my drives.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.160]   I have--
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.360]   I have a G4 on Remote Desktop that sits on all my drives.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   So while I'm traveling, I can always use Remote Desktop
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.640]   to get back to my--
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.080]   to look through any drive and FTP stuff from my computer up.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   And then I have my--
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.280]   And you can get happy days on it.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.640]   Which is--
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.000]   I can.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.340]   I can.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:38.840]   That's very good.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.760]   And then I have my MacBook Pro.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.400]   I don't understand a word he just said,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.840]   but I'm sure it was something very exciting.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.440]   I like to use-- I like to use--
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.680]   it's all about Remote Desktop when you're traveling.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.320]   I've done it in India, which was really--
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.880]   You use Remote Desktop.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.040]   I use it all the time.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.560]   I set up my--
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.200]   That's up as awesome.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.400]   Alutha here in the office.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.160]   He set up my-- he set up my laptop,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.520]   got through all the firewall stuff.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.720]   Alutha and Ben, and they--
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.840]   they got it all sorted out.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.560]   And so now I can see--
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.640]   I can log in to-- from my MacBook Pro, anywhere I'm traveling,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.680]   anywhere in the world.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.880]   I can log in and look at my screen, actually look at it,
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.600]   check old emails that I didn't-- that I need to look through.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.960]   Wow.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.560]   Define stuff, grab stuff from old hard drives that are all--
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.000]   so I'll be like, four drives--
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.800]   I've seen you do that actually in Toronto.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.080]   So I do buy that.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.680]   I do buy that.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   It's very, very, very--
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.240]   I'm using it to control my old 17-inch, which
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.520]   is my media computer now.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.880]   Right.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.120]   So I can keep the--
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720]   lid closed with Insomniac.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   And just use that as a media computer with remote desktop.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.440]   It's really--
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:33.960]   I just love--
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.480]   I just love--
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.320]   --going to hold on.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.920]   I tell you, I wish they'd hurry up with this ITV,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.560]   because I knew we needed ITV when my wife and I were sitting
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.000]   on the couch, kind of with our backs twisted just a little bit
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.520]   trying to watch Studio 60 on my MacBook.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.480]   And I had hooked it up to the speakers,
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.200]   but it didn't-- the cable didn't quite reach.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.400]   So the sound's coming over from kind of toward the back of us
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.840]   to the left.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   The screen is small, and we can't quite see it.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.400]   It's just terrible.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.560]   Yeah, I'm so pathetic.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.240]   Asking my wife to watch a movie with me on the computer,
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   I might as well ask her to go, like, an evening of playing D&D.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.720]   I thought I would be together.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.880]   She refuses to watch anything on a TV.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.240]   Which is funny, because we don't have a TV.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.240]   We watch everything on a laptop.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.000]   I told her I'd hold it in my lap.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.920]   She didn't have to hold it in hers.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.760]   It's depressing.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.200]   Oh, we-- it is kind of pressing.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.640]   I need to know a TV.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.240]   We have these big windows that outlook over all of the bay
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.760]   from our apartment.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.200]   And then you have those little couch that sits right in front
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.760]   of it, and then we just take our little laptop,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.920]   and we sit it down on our legs, and we watch Lost.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   And you're OK with that.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.880]   I can't even imagine any other--
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.240]   No, not by the same token, but we're on a flight.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.920]   It is kind of fun to watch an iPod.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.440]   Do you do the Steve Jobs maneuver
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.720]   where you take the headphone and you stick one in her ear
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.240]   and one in your ear?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.240]   You know, we actually just use the speakers in the computer.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   We don't actually use the headphone.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   It's not loud enough.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   It is for us.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   And we sit there and we sit there.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.240]   My wife was one of those people that asks you
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   to ask the questions during the show.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   Why did he just say--
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   What did he just say?
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   What happened there?
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   What did he just say?
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   I didn't hear that.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   I can't see really what's going on.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   Can you tilt the screen a little forward?
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   What did he just say?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   That kind of question.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   Why is I eat still on the boat?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   Why is my background?
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   Why is my background?
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   Why is my background?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   Why is my background?
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Well, see, that's why I use noise-canceling headphones
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   so that when my wife's asking questions,
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   I can go point to my ears and shake my head like,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   "Ask saw I can't hear you."
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   You can't hear a thing.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   Yeah, it works good.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   Nope.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   This was a horrifying moment when I realized
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   my wife was the kind of person that was going to ask a question
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   like, pretty much every five seconds during a movie.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   Well, the thing is, I actually enjoy the experience
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   when we're actually at the house.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   So it's kind of a fun thing because it makes the show
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   very effective, but when I'm in the theater,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   I'm a little more.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240]   Are you excited about the fact that they now have
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   a MagSafe airline adapter?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   I'm extremely excited about that.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   I spent a week trying to find some kind of gray market.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   So nobody else makes one.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   Nobody else makes one.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   It hasn't been available.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   Yeah, it has been 60 bucks.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240]   And I'll pay every penny up.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   60 bucks to have like three or four hours of like...
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   Well, and the thing is, is for me, it doesn't even...
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   I have three batteries for my laptop.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   I take generally with you on board.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   Yeah, except when he flies a virgin.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   Well, he flies to Africa.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   It's not exactly a 12 minute flight.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Yeah, but I would check batteries.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   No, because I need him for the flight.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   He needs him.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   He actually goes to...
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   No, he still has books in Africa.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   Could you take that in or...?
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   Yeah, yeah, it's all.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   Yeah, yeah, shut up.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   So, no, no, I...
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   So I have three batteries, but when you're doing like five or six hour
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   flights and when you're doing text and stuff like that,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   it's fine.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   But when you start doing like 3D computer graphics and stuff like that,
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   it will...
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   It chews up that...
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   You got about an hour and a half.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.240]   So, Pop Quiz, what are the two or three best airlines for being able to get a seat?
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   Were it used to use U-Seeker to find the seats that have them?
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   Yeah, the best airline domestically.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   Don't you have to fly business or first to get a seat?
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   No, no, best airline domestically.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   The best airline domestically will help you tease out the ones.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   Best airline domestically is US Airways.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   Not America West.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   That's because you fly to Newsburg.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   No, no, but...
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   So all the US Airways flights, all of them, even through economy,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   have power.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   Really?
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   And then when you're flying overseas, the cool thing about Singapore Airlines is that even
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.240]   in executive economy, they have plugs, regular three-pronged plugs.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   But you can use your 85 watt.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   That's right.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   So I have a 65 watt...
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   That's actually the one that says an 85 watt power.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.240]   Have you done that Air Canada flight, Leo, where you get the three-prong under the chair
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   and you get the USB port on the front view?
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.240]   Yeah, there's one plane in their entire fleet.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   It has little TVs in the back, so you don't even need your laptop.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   It's got a touchscreen.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   I felt like I was living in the Jetsons.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   It's got a touchscreen TV.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   You got that on the way home or the way home?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   On the way home from Toronto.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   Yeah, I got that one.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   Virgin's the best movie airline.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   But for the kids out there who want to make use of this, you say, "U.S. Air is a good one."
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   And see Guru.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   Yeah, see Guru is awesome.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   See Guru is awesome.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   You go find it and see Guru, but...
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.240]   The thing is, see Guru has got popular, and now it's really hard to find a good seat on a plane.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   Well, everybody knows.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   Everybody knows.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   I figured out how to...
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   It also frustrate me because everyone figured out how to get the exit row seats, which for a long time was the...
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   I just love what they're like, "Okay, and be careful because in this section here, it gets a little narrower."
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   I mean, at least that alone is helpful.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   I got the one seat where it gets narrower.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   There's like one in a 747 out of Virgin.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   There's one seat that is...
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   Kate Moss.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   Three inches.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   It's three inches thinner.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   And I got...
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   You know, I'm big boned.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   It was a very complex...
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   I feel like such an inadequate frequent flyer.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   I never do that.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.240]   I just take what they give me and I stay quiet and put my head between my legs and hope I'll get there.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   Oh, man.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   I throw...
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   I throw...
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   Carlita got the witness my last tantrum.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   You know, because I hate...
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   I heard about that.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   I heard about that.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   They actually have your picture in the middle.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   I sit in the aisle.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   I sit in the aisle and I'm not taking the mile.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   Do not give this man any attention.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   They start moving me around.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   So credit...
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   Credit were credits to the German Mac Gadget blog.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.240]   Actually called this one a week ago.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   They said the Core 2 would come out on the MacBook Pro.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.240]   They said Firewire 800.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   Bigger hard drives.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   I don't know how they knew.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   Faster graphics card, faster DVD burners.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   They called it down to the absolute detail.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.240]   Germans.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   And...
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   So when was the announcement?
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   Was it today that they slipped this out?
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   I saw it on...
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   Was it Gizmodo?
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   Very...
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   I got up earlier this morning.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   This morning.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   So I think it was less...
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   I think it broke it about midnight.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   Yeah, it was the midnight press.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   And you ordered it...
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   I think when, Scott?
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   I ordered mine at about ten AM.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   Ten AM.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   Okay.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   I want you to know that I was trying to be judicious because I thought, well, I don't want to order the very first one.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   Because I did actually order the second one.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   Well, you know, I got to tell you, I think I actually did order the very first MacBook Pro because I left...
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   I was sitting next to you at Alex in the keynote.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   I left to go teach an aperture class with their story at Macworld.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   So Derek was standing up doing the introduction.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   I immediately opened my laptop and got on Wi-Fi.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   He was talking and ordered it.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   So it wouldn't have been three minutes after Jobs left it.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   I ordered my MacBook Pro.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   You guys are crazy.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   You buy any...
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   I waited.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   You drank any.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   No, it's just like Merlin said, we want to buy things in the beginning of the product.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.240]   I had to.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   In the end, like you do.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   You know, that cube is a really good thing to have.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   I love my cube.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   I love my cube.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.240]   I might want one of these.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   I'll tell you why.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   I've been very disappointed with the video performance on the MacBook.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   And here's the one thing that I really needed to do.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   I did a PowerPoint presentation on the last Geek Cruise that had some video in it.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   Now I use a second screen because I watched the presenter notes on my main screen and the PowerPoint screen is a second screen.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   And the video did not play back without stuttering.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   It stuttered very bad.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   So badly, I couldn't really use the video.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   So I'm thinking I might need one of these.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   MacBook Pro for Leo.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.240]   Well, I just think that that's the one place where I've seen the MacBook is just underpowered that Intel GMA 950 video.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   What are we looking at for one of these?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   It's not the totally the totally rain man Scott Bornford.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   More like 20,000 to 2500.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   2500?
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   It's starting to be rain man.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   You know, excellent.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   Excellent computer.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   Excellent computer.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   It's definitely.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   It's definitely.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   Definitely.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   Definitely.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   Good aperture.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240]   Time for MacBook.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   Okay, definitely.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   Definitely.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.240]   It's the first thing being labeled.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   2500.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   I want to point that out.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240]   Thurston.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   Hey Leo, I'm going to give you and everyone listening a tip right now.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   What's that?
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   The thing to do is to go to the Apple store.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   To the refer button and they've really dropped the prices on the non-murrum chip MacBook Pro.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   If you want to get into a MacBook Pro but you don't want to spend the money for the new version, then that would be a way to do it.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   I'm going to say Merle is right here all the week.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   Buying refurb off Apple.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   Good idea?
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   Yes.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   Absolutely.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240]   I think in general.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   I bought my third airport express.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   Yes, I have three airport expresses.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   Why?
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   Because I'm an idiot.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   I bought the third one I bought was refurb and I have not had a problem in the world.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   No, of course not.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   It just seems scary.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   I don't buy refurbs.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   No, no, I'll tell you why refurb is good.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   From somebody like Adele or an Apple, they can't sell anything that's been opened as new.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   So right away, you know, they need to have an outlet for the stuff that somebody bought opened and sent back.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   And I think that's most of what you're getting.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   It's brand new.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   And it has a warranty.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   It comes with a warranty.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   It's brand new.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   And I think that's the key.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   If it's a recent model, it's got the full warranty.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.240]   It's got the full warranty.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   I think it's okay.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   See, my problem is I'm always afraid that someone used that computer the way I would.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   Like maybe licked it and put it back in the box.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   Of course.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   Anyway, I hope Alex Liz gets this one.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   So I'm just kind of like, "Oh, I would never want to buy a rea--"
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   I would never want to buy a rea--
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   But it's true.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   This is something that mom always used to say.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   You never put an airport express in your mouth because you never know where it's been.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   I don't know where it's been.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   I think that's true today than it's ever been.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   Oh, gosh.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   Hey, look.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   There's a limber, right?
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   There is a-- I know, no, we get our bag quick.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   There's a link on here that says, "How do--"
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   This is good.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   This isn't there frequently asked questions.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   "How do I send a compliment about the Apple store?"
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   I ask that very carefully.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   I ask that very carefully.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   I ask that very carefully.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Let me just click here.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   "Use this form to send us a compliment."
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   You guys are so great.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   You noticed that there's cobwebs on that form, are we?
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   Yeah, well, I have to say the page popped right up.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   Not a lot of people--
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   Yeah, there's nothing-- there's nothing I hate more than a needy corporation.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   Send me compliments, please.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   Seriously, you guys, take this quiz.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   Take this online quiz.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   Okay, so there's three models.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   Now, this is another good question because Apple always does this.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   They have the low end that nobody wants.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   They have the mid-range, and then they have the high end that everybody wants.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   You're saying that you recommend that what a scott born?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   What do you recommend?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   Actually the--
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   Not the low end?
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   Any of these are fine.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   The reason why Leo is because they've bumped up the minimum spec now to the point where even the low end--
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   Yeah, the low end computer is faster than the high end one that I bought right after the keynote.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   That's disgusting.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   And they haven't charged any more money.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   So--
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   And so you're getting a faster processor.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.240]   You started with the minimum two gigs of RAM.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   I started here with the low end, put an extra gig because it starts with one gig on the low end.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   On the very low end.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:36.240]   Yeah, the 1999, put another gig in, put the slightly larger 160 gig hard drive because I probably don't want to use the external because it's portable.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   And it's 2274, which I think is fairly--
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   Oh, here's another question.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   You get to choose at no extra cost the glossy or the max.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   Okay, don't do it.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   Don't do it.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   Don't do it.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   I don't like the glossy.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   I don't like the glossy.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   You remember that Leo went up to brunch that day and the guy behind the counter had the glossy?
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   Remember I was asking him about that?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   I have the glossy on my max book.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It's all weird.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   You don't like the glossy.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   It's like a bell.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   It looks like a bell.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   It's so reflective.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   Not a bell, but you know what I mean.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   It's so reflective that you can't see if you have any lights around you, like on an airplane or something, if the person next to you is reading or whatever.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   It's very hard to see for me.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   I like to--
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   Is there a rule of thumb about who should pick a glossy versus Matt?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   People say it's a richer image if you do the glossy.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   You know the glossy.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   You're going to get more contrast.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   That's the word around the town.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   What if it depends on the light?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   I don't like it.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   I don't like it.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   I would never.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.240]   I would never get a glossy.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   A glossy coat.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   I think it looks nicer.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   Like it looks prettier.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   It does look perfect.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   I don't think-- I think workability.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   I would not want to have that.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240]   I got a question for you, Leo, though.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   The default, by the way, just interestingly, the default on this is not the glossy.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   You have to actually choose the glossy.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   It's for those people who've spent $150 extra for Black Mac book.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   Well, I have to say the glossy does definitely hold the fingerprints.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   I kind of think it's expensive fast.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   That little $2,000 I got--
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   The one I want would be $3,274.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   See, I want that to upgrade it.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.240]   What did you do to upgrade it?
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   Well, you know, I went for the three gigs of RAM.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   See, that's a mistake.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   You don't need three.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   You say, "Do that myself to make my own RAM."
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   Oh, just put two in.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   You think so?
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   What do you need three for?
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   All right, and then if you're running programs like Aperture, you need three.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.240]   I don't know if this keychain thing is going to get worse.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   Do you need three for Aperture?
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   You know, if you really want a really good experience, if you're doing, I mean running
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   Pro Tools, Aperture, anything that taps into Core Audio.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   If you're running them all at once.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   Or just no, if you're not.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   Even if you're not.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   You're not more for three gigs.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   It's $575 more for one X-ray gig.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   Come on, Leo.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   You lose that much change in your couch every week.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   Oh, I don't.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   Kick down.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Kick down, but--
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   Here's the deal.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   On the low end, to go from one to two gigs is $175.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   But for some reason, to go from one to three gigs is $750.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   Because you got to buy one megabyte Sims is what's going on.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   And you have to have two of each, remember, because we're looking at a due processor machine.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   You could afford the extra gig if you threw, like, 1.3 people off Twitch each week.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.240]   I'm looking here.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   This is a properly configured using starting with the low end at two grand and configuring
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   it with a mirror, a mirror, two gigs of RAM.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   Which seems like quite a lot to me.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   Doesn't that seem amazing?
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   I mean, in the fact--
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   A mirror.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.240]   I think, back to my-- the fastest computer in terms of user experience for me was my SE30.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   And 1990--
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   Oh, I know.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   SE30, remember that was--
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   With a 21-inch monochrome screen, had eight megabytes of RAM and it flew.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   I'd like to say that when I was working on Star Wars, I had to write a three-page proposal
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   of why they should go-- they should bump my RAM at ILM from 128 megas of RAM on my beige--
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   - Two megas of RAM. - --three to 192 megas of RAM.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   - And really?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   I had to write the long paper justifying how I would save this many minutes a day from rendering
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   and that would be able to do these things and it would be--
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   You had to make like a business case for mine.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   I had to make a business case.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   So everyone else had 128, 128 megas of RAM.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   That was plenty.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.240]   You don't get rich and buy a bunch of plaid shirts by spending a lot of money on memory.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   And you're saying I should buy the app, wait a minute, I'm going to go back and buy the AppleCare.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   You got to buy the AppleCare.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   Get the AppleCare.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   Get the wheel.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   The wheel.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   Get the AppleCare.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   Why would I get the AppleCare?
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   Because something will help at some point in time and then you'll call the 800 number and they'll say,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   "Do you have AppleCare?"
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   You'll say yes and they'll say anything you want.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   - Can I just go, "No, but I'm Leo LaPorte?"
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   - That could work.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   - That might work actually.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   - I'm Leo LaPorte and they will never find your body.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   - I did.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   (laughter)
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.240]   - You know what happened to Hoffa?
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   Just remember the Jersey Meadows.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   You got a lovely family.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   - I'll tell you how well that might work for you because while driving through San Francisco yesterday,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   I was stopped by one of San Francisco's finest and he said your name certain.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   - Leo LaPorte and he said, "Go right ahead."
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   (laughter)
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   - Which is funny because I said it's got more and actually I'm just lucky to be here today.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   (laughter)
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   - I got one of those pillows though, so it's okay.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   - Oh good.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   - Leo, I have a question for you to change the subject a little bit.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.240]   - Have you seen the, I know we've been talking about the ULA related to Vista?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.240]   - Yes.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   - Have you seen the Vista, the stuff that relates to the Mac,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   the stuff that relates to virtualization?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   - Yeah, in fact we talked about it on Windows, we talked about it on Paul Therat.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   No, we didn't talk about it last time, we talked about it on Windows show.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   - The thing is that that's kind of a big deal, isn't it?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   That theoretically important in virtualization means not being able to use it in your own.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   - In order to do that you have to buy the Windows Ultimate Edition to do it legally.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   - The issue is going to be can they figure out that that's what you're doing and stop you?
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   - Right.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   - And Paul was in the opinion that they can make that as the ULA, but it's not really an enforceable clause.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   - Yeah.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   - In any event--
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   - But for our system administrator they can enforce that on people?
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   - Yeah, so in order to be completely legal from the Microsoft point of view you would have to buy Windows Ultimate,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   Vista Ultimate Edition instead of the Home or the Basic or the Low End Edition.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   But you're right, and I think, in fact, we talked about it quite a bit.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   I think Microsoft made some real blunders in their new license agreement.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   They say, for instance, you can only transfer it once.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   You can only move it to another computer once.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   You can only sell it once, and you can't use virtualization on it.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   But the biggest problem is going to be the copy protection.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   And here we are.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   We're sitting using an operating system that has no copy protection.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   I mean, Apple probably would love it if we bought a copy for every computer when Leopard comes out.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   But how many-- don't most people just buy one copy of Leopard and put it on all their systems?
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   - Yeah, well, the thing is, is that an Apple does pretty well on just that.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   - Well, they get a bit of a--
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   - They get a bit of a hardware from them.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   I mean, the difference is-- and I brought this up with Paul-- you still have to have an Apple.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   - Well, and I think that the rumor is, is that Leopard's also going to push the hardware pretty hard.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   So what you're going to-- you can have it, but you're going to want to upgrade to another computer in the not too distant future.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   I mean, with all the stuff that Apple has--
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   - You really want to be Intel, right?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   - Yeah, you'll definitely want to be Intel.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   You'll-- you know, this is-- you know, the operating systems are getting--
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   you know, they have a lot more performance.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   They look cooler. They're prettier. They do a lot more things, but they keep on getting heavier and heavier and heavier.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   - That's another-- another-- - Just keep on, you know, pushing you.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.240]   - I just want to point out that if you did get the Vista and you were summarily crippled like that,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   it would be a perfect complement to your Zoom that won't play podcast.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   No, I think there's going to be a backlash against Microsoft. I think they've really--
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   - Do you think that would be substantial, though? I mean, how substantial would they put a different way?
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   How substantial would a backlash would they--?
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   - Well, not much. - Yeah, I don't think--
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   - And with the deals, I do think they're going to close. They're going to close some loopholes.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   I think they may lose up to 5 or 10% of their users over three or four years.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   - That's-- that's-- that's a success year.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   - What Paul and I agreed is this only hurts the 5% of enthusiasts.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   The rest of the world just goes, "Okay, whatever."
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   - Well, but the other thing is that I think that they'll make it-- - It's a lot for Apple.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   - I do think-- I think it's-- no, it's a lot for Apple.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   - It's a big game for Apple. - It's a big game for Apple.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   - Yeah. - It's a big game for Apple. They're going to--
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   they could double their market share if they get aggressive about this.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   - And I think they can-- - They could double their market share.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   And I think Microsoft will make more money by tightening the software protection.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   So I think that they're going to-- they'll increase their revenue by more than the 5% that they're losing.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   - Do you think any of this has to do in part with the growth in places like China
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   and the need to lock that kind of stuff down harder?
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   - I think it's Bill Gates' personality. He's always hated piracy.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   And it's just finally-- it's getting to him.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   - They're big enough where they can do something new.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   - Apple's announced that Leopard will not come out till after Vista.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   In fact, not probably till the end of the first quarter.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   - Really? Now, is that Leopard will not come out until after Vista as in a firm thing?
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   We're just going to wait for Vista to come back and make it a big deal.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   - No, I don't think that was their intent when they said that.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   I think what they meant to say was we're coming out on the fourth--
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   towards the end of the first quarter.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   I think that was the timeframe. They said sometime first quarter, now they're saying late first quarter.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   And somebody observed, probably me, that that means they'll come out after Vista.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   Which is so smart because you want to see what Microsoft's stolen so that you can change it to be better.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   - Right. - Right.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   - And do you think it also limits the amount of exposure of like,
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   "Hey, here's our new whizzy thing we slipped in at the last minute?"
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   - I think so. I think so. Don't show them what you got.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   Because as many people--
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   - Because it would delay-- I think Apple's doing a service for everyone because otherwise if they released it in January,
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   it means that Vista would have to be delayed another six months as they tried to figure out how to incorporate those things too.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   - That's so mean. Why would you do that to all those poor windows?
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   - I know. You've got to let them have their operating system.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   - Yeah. - Well, they're still young.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   - Yeah, well, you missed it, Alex, but we did do the iPhone in great detail and Scott got all excited.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   Now we're going to see similar-- and I think it's from the same-- is it?
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   No, maybe it's a different source, but similar, well-informed sources say the full screen iPod will also be out.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   The sixth generation, but this is the interesting one.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   Next month or like in December.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   I don't believe that. I don't buy that one. - Not earlier.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   - I'm picking a bit. - I will tell you that some of the same sources
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   that predicted the exact drop date on the MacBook Pro being today
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   did make that prediction. - Same prediction?
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   - That we would see a December full screen video iPod.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   - Wouldn't that just cut into their sales like nobody's business?
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.240]   - Well, they're trying to maybe sneak in-- - Before the couple days before Christmas,
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   and they're looking at, you know, if you get in-- you open this thing up like for December 5th,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   you still have 10, 15 shopping days. You could sell a couple of hundred thousand of those puppies.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   I'm going to use a phrase I never use, which is supply chain.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   I don't really know what supply chain is, but it seems to me that this would really screw up--
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   - I'm so-- - Isn't that kind of crazy?
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   They got all this. You're going to try and push out all the people you're going to get in place.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.240]   - It's not just a supply chain. It's the channel. - Really? Oh, really? So, hmm.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   What about-- will this scale across the enterprise?
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   - No, I think not. And I think at the end of the day, the real issue is going to--
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   - No, really, seriously. - I'm not kidding.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   - That's just going to happen. - Yep.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   - Look, look, I don't want to blow the ocean here.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   - Now, we're not going to boil the ocean. It's not a problem.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   - I really don't want to boil the ocean. - I do think actually the channel is who you're actually
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   potentially screwing. Those are the people who have the existing iPods, who are now completely useless.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   You can't sell them, because everybody wants to buy these full screen iPods.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   - At what point do you start getting into-- I don't know if you guys remember in the--
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   welcome again to Merlin's Rat Hole. I don't know if you guys remember in the mid-90s at that point when--
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   - It seems like they were coming-- - There were a hole with no ratier than mine.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   - I just want to point to that. - If you remember when Apple was coming up, it seemed like they were coming up with some new line of business every week or two.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   - Yeah. - And they had all these different lines, and they had the consumer line, and they had the business line, and this one's great for students.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.240]   And they were constantly-- and it got so confused.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   - It got to the point where I could not figure out what Matt's going to buy.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   - I knew everything about it. I still couldn't figure out which one I want to buy.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   - That's an easy one where jobs really did clean things up quite a bit.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   - That's right. Now we've got the Oprah iPod. You've got these little-- you've got these Nannos that used to be Minis.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   You've got the Piersk videos. - There's product creep. It's product creep, and I think it really does happen, and it's hard to fight.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   - And Apple's never been loath to screw their chair. - Of course, but it's inexpensive. I know it's expensive for some people, but it's inexpensive enough that I realized the other day I looked at my desk and I had almost every-- a version of almost every iPod floating around my desk somewhere.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   - I can buy it. I just go, "Oh, that one will be cool for this." And I'm waiting for-- and here's the works. I'm waiting for the new little Nannos so that I can get it from my workout.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   - I think this is-- - You put my workout locker. - If they do it, it's a bad thing to do, but it's an anti-zoon measure.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   And I think if they do it, it's Steve Jobs really saying, "I'm going to screw Bill Gates and being very aggressive about it."
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   Even though it's bad for the channel, it's bad for consumers, it's bad for iPod sales, it's bad for Apple in the long run.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   - You know what it's good for them? - What? - Those of us waiting for our iPhone.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   - Shut up. - Did you guys see the story from our friend, the Mac-alope, about the possible little twist to the--
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   I'll tell you, if you're going to talk rumors, it should come based on drunk talk.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   And the Mac-alope overheard some very interesting drunk talk.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   - So tell us. - Do you have to slur when you're going to tell us this story?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   - Seriously, seriously, you guys. - All right.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   - Seriously. - I'll tell you what I said. - I'm so really good that you guys are here right now. I just want to say, seriously.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   - No, the Mac-alope-- - Order to three.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   - The Mac-alope here is possible that some of the time--
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   - How can you trust a blog called the Mac-alope?
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   - Yeah. - I mean, where did the world you come up with this, Merle?
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   - This is the authoritative source, a guy called the Mac-alope.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   - Mac-alope? - Well, what did the Mac-alope say?
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   Merle was giving me this dare of luck right now, Leo.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   - He's just trying to figure out where the hair ends.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   - You guys don't follow the Mac-alope? - No, I don't follow the Mac-alope.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   - Hey, I've even heard the Mac-alope before today.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   - Well, first of all, you've got to trust the Mac-alope because the Mac-alope speaks in third person.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   - Okay. - And you have to trust anybody that does press.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   - He says, "Get this." The Minotaur, he's got nicknames for his friends, I guess, takes the Mac-alope to a couple of events and then stops showing up.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   Claims he was going to go but got lost in the maze, blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   Anyway, the Mac-alope was mingling and started talking to some fawns.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   - These particular fawns insisted that they knew some leprechauns who knew a priest who knew someone at Apple.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   And they were saying that they heard through this channel that the iPhone is not a phone in the physical sense.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   - What is it? - A technology.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   - A technology? - That's right, Leo. It's a technology like VoIP.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   And then what Apple's going to do, I'm quoting here from the Mac-alope, is to put all this on the Macs
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   so that each Mac's ships as a computer and, bump, bump, bump, a phone.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   - So there you go, it's Skype. - So you got the Mac-alope, you got some drinking, you got fawns, leprechauns, and the possibility that your computer could be used held up to your ear as a phone.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   - And in my five decades on this planet, I have never heard a more miserably- - It's terrible.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   - Cocked story in my life. My phone is coming, Merlin, and don't you try to say it.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   - Don't you try to say it. - This is not credible.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   - You should do that thing like Jeannie does, where you fold your arms and...
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   - Maybe it'll happen. I'll do it. - I do it a bit.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   - You guys mock the Mac-alope, but you know... - Yes, we do gladly mock the Mac-alope.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   - You know what? I'll tell you what, big shot. You're the one making all these best with people, right?
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   - I'll bet 10. - You want to make them that?
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   - $1000, you name the charity. Mac-alope's right, I'll write the check to 10.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   - A, I don't have $10,000. B, the charity is me. C.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   Cash on the barrel head. Watch what the Mac-alope says. The Mac-alope is, I would have to say that right now out there,
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   along with the airing fireball, the Mac-alope is my favorite Mac-alope.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   - I like how it's written. - I like the third person. You can't go wrong there, because basically it lets you off the hook.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   - I really think you need a dramatic reading of it though.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   - I think a Mac-alope podcast, I think, would be very...
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   - We're attributing things to a man whose friend his name is Minator, folks.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   - And he talks to Fawns. So the question is, if your imagination are pressing to me, Scott.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.240]   - The question is, Marlon, did this make it to theapplerumertracker.com?
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   - Well, you only know it's really true if all the sub-Mac rumor sites are reporting it.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   The ones who steal from the higher echelon made up stuff sites.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   - This is actually great. - This is actually great.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   - Actually, Mac-alope, by and large, actually I'll end my plug just by saying it actually is a very fun kind of,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   if you enjoy the kind of just aggressive Mac advocacy and...
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   - And complete criticism. - And furah.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   - But it's no, but it's a fun site.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   - I'm gonna start reading it. I'm gonna start reading it.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   - Oh my God. - I learned about it from Daring Fireball.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   Listen, I'm telling you, Scott, we can get you this web in a way that we can bring into your home.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   You can watch it on our 50 TV. You're never gonna have to move away from your Victrol.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   It's gonna be very comfortable. - Thank you.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   - We'll get you that nice warm tea you like to have.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   - You know, here I was involved in this podcast with all these expert Macintosh people,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   and we've been reduced to quoting Minitars.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   - All right, let's talk about Apple's fourth quarter results.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   - A bum bum. - Yeah, I'm sure the analyst on Wall Street
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   wanna hear with the Minotaur has to say about those.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.240]   - Now this is factual. Apple posted revenue of $4.84 billion
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   in net quarterly profit of $546 million at 62% per diluted share.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   Don't get confused. These are diluted shares.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.240]   - I don't know what that means. - I don't know what that means either.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   - I'll tell you what that means. - Wait, wait, wait.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   - What's a diluted share? - No, no, no, we asked Scott that question.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   - Why Scott is a diluted share? - A diluted share means, like, let's say
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   you invest in the company and you're a principal investor and you have a thousand shares,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   and at that time maybe that's half the company 'cause there's only 2,000 shares,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   but then after that they sell like 200 million shares.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   Your thousand shares aren't quite worth what they were when it was half the company.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   Those are diluted shares. - I'm sorry I asked that.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.240]   - In any event, Wall Street was predicting like 40 cents a share.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   They made 62. That usually is a good sign for it for the Apple stock.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   - Is that diluted sense? - Don't do it.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.240]   - It's like the lot it is what it's like.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   - The depressing thing is here that they've risen about six bucks since I sold them,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   thinking they were gonna get smacked for the options thing and they didn't.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   - Look, you know, Alex was saying, "Bye Apple," and I think he was right.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   A huge jump, I mean, we're talking a big jump over the same time last year.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   1.61 million Mac computers. This isn't three months.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:32.240]   8.7 million iPods. Now that's actually a drop of iPods from last quarter,
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   but in both cases, 30% and 35% growth over a year ago quarter.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   So Apple is really on a roll. In fact, one analyst said after this,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   "Bye Apple because this is just the beginning. Wait till you hear what they tell you in January."
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   - That's right. I'm still looking at that right now.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   The UBS investment research has, and you're also hearing a lot of, I think in the CIA,
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   they call it Chatter about all this interesting 2007 stuff.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   Have you guys heard speculation about all this?
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   - We know ITB or the neighbors come to people or something.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   - And the iPhone.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.240]   - ITB and iPhone are the two things driving the analyst expectations.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   - Really?
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   - That's what they're looking at.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   - I actually do listen to these conference calls sometimes.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   - Do you?
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   - Yeah, and I gotta tell you, that's the two things that's got them excited.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   The iPhone and the ITB.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   - I think I actually have a recording of the last one.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   Let me see if I can...
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.240]   - He still had that on.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.240]   - He still had that on.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   [laughter]
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   - No, no.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   - Sometimes Steve gets on and he's not prepared.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   - Kind of, they can generate, I think.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   That's his history, by the way. That's his history. Just never prepared.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   - Actually, I did listen to that call, and I thought it was pretty good,
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.240]   except for the point where he wanted to stop for 45 minutes and listen to a Jefferson airplane record.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   - When was that?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.240]   - No, that was Jesus Christ Superstar.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.240]   - Oh, no, that's Jesus Christ Superstar.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   - It's a good knocking until you've listened to it on strong hallucinogens.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   Everybody loves a group of rumors.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   How accurate does Sink think secret Apple matters, says...
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   - Half.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   - Half accurate?
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.240]   - Eight for 19. Now, if that were batting, that would be good.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   - That would be very good.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   - That would be good in baseball.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   - You'd make a lot of... You'd get a good signing bonus for batting that ever.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   - I think it would be better than I thought, to be honest with you.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   - Right.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   - The Minotaur is three for 19.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   - I want to have the Mac-a-loaf.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   - Somehow not as good.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   - He still can't get out of the...
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   - Now, in the among the Apple Roddy, if I can use that term,
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   isn't Sink secret?
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   Is kind of regarded as one of the oracles that one can trust for these things?
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.240]   - Well, they got sued.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.240]   - Sink, if they get sued, that really brings your stock way up.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   - It gets all the rumors first.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.240]   - Is that his secret?
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.240]   - All I know is that no one really knew about which one was the best one.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   I mean, is it Apple Insider?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   - It could be the minute.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   - It could be the minute.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   - It's rumors.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   Is it Sink secret?
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   And then Sink secret got sued, which means that they must have been close to a nerve.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   And I think what happened was, I think, they were reporting the, I believe it was the shuffle early on or right before.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   - Well, this is one of the articles that I posted to our list this week,
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   which is from October 6th article on AppleMatters.com called "How Accurate Is Sink Secret?"
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.240]   And it tracks just straight back to actually last week's "Rat Hole" by Merlin,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   which was, how do you actually reasonably predict or try to watch for trackers of what's really happening in these industries?
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   And they did something I guess I've always hoped people would do, which is they went back and looked at all these predictions.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   - I think it's very valuable, yeah.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   - How often did they get it right?
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   How often did they get it wrong?
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   And how often did they miss something that actually did come out instead?
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   - It's less than half right.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   And when you really look at what they got wrong, a lot of the misses are big misses.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   I think the number doesn't just, doesn't do it justice.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   I mean, a lot of them are so wildly wrong that you just have to wonder.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   - Well, what's really weird is that when some of these sites, and I don't remember if it was "Think Secret,"
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   I think that might have been one of these sites was the site that gave rise to the rumor,
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   which Leo bought right into, was that Aperture was dead and started this whole thing that Aperture was dead
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   and all the team was fired and dismembered and blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   And when they were called on it by the guy that was actually being hired to run the new Aperture team,
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   they refused to retract it.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.240]   I mean, he said, "No, you're wrong. I'm running the Aperture team."
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   - Yeah. - "We're not retracting."
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   - Wow, that's so much. - I mean, they...
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   - It's just crazy.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.240]   So I think you just have to take what they say.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   - Sounds like Tony Snow. - Yeah, Tony Snow.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]   Used to work at Aperture.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.240]   No, no, I mean, Apple tricks or whatever.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   - Well, I just thought it was interesting because, you know, I'm kind of...
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   I don't really follow this stuff very carefully as my weekly ignorance on this stuff shows,
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   but I do think it's interesting.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.240]   In the same way that you get all the pundits on TV, making all these prognostications,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   I think it is kind of fun to go back and look at, you know, where they're getting it right
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   and where they're getting it wrong.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   Do you guys have one of these sites that you feel like right now you kind of trust over?
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   - I don't follow it. - We sit here and we have fun.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   - I look at them all. - We look stuff delicious.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   - I don't like to. - I wouldn't look at them if I were doing this, to be honest.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   - I mean, I have an R... I have like... I use Safari's RSS compiler,
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   - You know, where you use wire, baby. - And I just have like...
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   No, I have like, you know, 20 max sites that are all in the...
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   You know, they're just all listed in order of time that they were posted within Safari,
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   which is the only thing I wish that they would add to Firefox,
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   but the only reason I use Safari is specifically for that one feature,
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   being able to stack them all, mixing them by date.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   - I only follow one blog, 43 folders. - If it's not on 43 folders, then, you know what,
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   I don't need to know about that.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   - I heard that guy, the guy that does that site, he's very into the pot.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   And he's not really clicking on all cylinders.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.240]   - Okay. - That's what I heard.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   - Well, he does have a 12 cylinder motor, and only six of them puppies are firing.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   - All I know is the only time I ever visited his home,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   there was insets burning the whole time.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   I don't want to say anything.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   - Well, did you have a virtual Chiapet going on his computer when you were there, Leo?
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   - No comment.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   - He wanted to see if there was electronic hair on the Chiapet. Oh, comment.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   - I think it'd be interesting to see it.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.240]   Has anybody ever seen something like a stock exchange for this stuff,
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   or somebody goes through and actually kind of tracks this stuff over time?
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.240]   - You know, it's so often bad that I think it's kind of apparent to be asked.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   - But people love it, dude. Go watch, go get it.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   - They love it. I know. Yeah, they love it.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   - One of the ways that I steal ideas for stories on this program,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   on which we're speaking right now, is to just go look at dig and find out what people are talking about.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   And invariably, I mean, you know, a huge amount of the stuff that's popular
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   are on Apple, tagged with Apple and dig, is just a lot of it's pretty, you know,
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   links to speculative stuff. - Yeah.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   - Here's one. - So, I mean, the thing is, but it's a little bit like the lottery, right?
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.240]   Where the, like, you're going to buy these tickets because it's really fun to buy tickets.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   You don't think about how often you lost. You think about how excited you are to get the new one.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   And I think that's kind of what keeps you quiet. - Exactly.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   - It's like gambling. It's like gambling. It's like anything else. It's addictive.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   But I don't know. I think I'm getting burned out by these, you know,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.240]   you do three or four rumors completely wrong. You miss really badly.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   I think it makes it hard to go back and believe. You want to believe.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   But I think it makes it hard to go back and believe. - That's why the only site you should go to is
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.240]   Crazy Apple Rumors. - Really? Is there such a site?
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   - Oh, you're kidding me, right? - No.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   - So, you don't know about the Macalope and you don't know about Crazy Apple Rumors? - No.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   - Well, you need to spend some time with CrazyAppleRumors.com, where you can go and find all of the most
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   outlandish made up ridiculous stuff. - They're made up, though.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   - Oh, absolutely. But they're awesome. - They make people up.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   - And they're, that's different from the other ones, how? - It's true. It's true.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   It's, by the end, that's a very enjoyable site that I would recommend you check out.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   - I'm checking out right now. I'm sorry. [laughter]
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   - That's what we call the Radio Business Dead Ear folks. - Yeah, that's not right.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   - Yeah. - So...
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.240]   - I really wish I hadn't drank all that coffee. - Look at me. I'm a Japanese cartoon character.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   - All right. Let's do our picks and get the hell out of this, this downer, man.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:57.240]   - Disco is out. Do you care about disco? I have to say... - What does it do?
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   - It doesn't matter what it does. It has the best viral marketing ever.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   - Ever. - But no one knows what it does.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   - It's a disc burning utility, basically. That's a good disco.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   - It's a disco? - It has one really cool feature.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   Let me find the website for you. - It's DiscoApp.com's like a lot.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   - Okay. - I mean, it's a good one.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   - These are the same guys that make apps app, or is that correct?
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   - Yes. - That's a terrific...
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   - And I think that's one of the reasons there's interest, because of course they've done other good software.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   But they've just, I think, marketed it really well. So the beta came out yesterday.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   The way they did it, they did it kind of a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory golden ticket kind of a thing.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   People who pre-ordered got a ticket, right?
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   And then you can go and you enter your ticket and you can download the program.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   It'll only be $15 introductory price. It's just a better...
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.240]   - What is it? - ... drag and drop burner.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   It does a few things that I think are great.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   One is it keeps track of what you've burned, so you have a discography of previous burns, like where your discs are.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   You can search it.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:03.240]   But the thing everybody's most excited about is it smokes while it burns.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   - Oh, yeah. - Just as you do, Merlin, actually.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   - Oh, I'm sorry, you burn when you smoke. - Oh, my God.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   But this is...
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   - Oh, my God. - I don't know what it does.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   In fact, I should put a disc in here and try because you can enable smoke, but you can also enable microphone input.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   I don't know what that does. And then the styles are smoke, fire, goo, icy, missed, purple haze, red, sea, and steam.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   - Okay. - Wow.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   - Wait a minute. I gotta get a blank disc. You talk amongst yourselves.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   - Well, have you guys tried burn? The actually app called Burn, which is a...
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   - You know, I've tried the... - I think it's a free- as in speech, free- as in beer app that I've been using.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   It's a substitute for toast. It's a very easy burner. - I... - Super simple interface.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   - I do the whole... - Do you really need it?
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   - 'Cause it doesn't... - It's a cool quick and say burn to disc.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   - Yeah, it doesn't. Apple just basically have all the stuff. - It's in the operating system.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   - Yeah. - Why would I... I guess I don't get the whole thing where I don't need anything else.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   I hold down my control key and if I have a disc in there, I say burn to disc and then it burns a disc.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   - And I just think this is very machy. - Pretty much all I need.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   It has a drag and drop interface, so you basically drag from the finder.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   - I don't get it. - You don't get it?
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   - You can't see Alex back here mocking me. - I don't understand why I would have another application.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   - Something that can be used. - I like the slogan, "We're having toast for breakfast."
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   - Well, the thing about toast is it's faster than any of these applications. - Is it really?
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   - Oh, yes. - I think so.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   - I have to admit, I burn a disc once a month or two.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   - And secondly, toast is a wonderful application if you need to convert file formats, 'cause it does that very well.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   - It doesn't dog slow to me. The only conversion I ever do is AVI to make it be a DVD.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   - I burn disc because I make copies of photographs on a regular basis as sending off the client.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   - I'm gonna press the burn button now. I wanna see this smoke.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   - By the way, you can't get burn right now because it's in a bit.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.240]   - It's not special. - But it will not be.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   - And if you didn't sign up ahead of time, you couldn't get it.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   - Disco, not burn. - Disco.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   - Burn is your program, right? - You are so high.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.240]   - Okay, Merlin, what's your pick? - Pressure's on.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.240]   - What is my pick? - I got a picture.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   - Hey, have we done Tangerine? Have we done Tangerine?
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   - We haven't done Tangerine. - I just started playing with this, and with any luck, I'm gonna get some of those fancy Nike shoes, so I can...
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   I don't know if many of you know, but I'm morbidly obese.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.240]   I'm just a little bit over 5 feet tall, and I weigh... Okay, I weigh 890 pounds.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm a man who likes to eat.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   - You're on a shred over 750. - I'm gonna...
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   You know?
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   My supporting man girdle, I have to wear it.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   It actually makes me look a lot slimmer.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   But I'm gonna get a pair of those Nike shoes with the iPod.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   - I have that iPod thing. - What's the story behind Tangerine?
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.240]   - I just sent me the Nike thing with the iPod, but I don't run.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   - I'm going somewhere with this. - I'm giving it to Amber.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   She's gonna review it. So how does Tangerine tie into that?
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.240]   - Well, the reason I say Tangerine lets you...
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   Basically, it grabs your iTunes songs, and it kind of scans them all for beats per minute,
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   and lets you create playlists, custom playlists based on how fast you want to be doing things,
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.240]   or what kind of BPMs you want to listen to.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   And what's nice about it is that...
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.240]   So basically, you get the idea that it scans your list,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   but then it's got a nice little gooey for dragging and dropping,
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   and the intensity of the beats and length of the song are expressed in two dimensions.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   So you can build these little... Like I will let's say, I want a 180 BPM playlist.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.240]   - That's a lot of beats. - That's a lot of beats.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   - That's a lot of beats. Talking like underworld, like angry...
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   - That's really much more music. - But no, it's kind of cool.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   I haven't played with it much yet, and it does have one small feature,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   which is that it sometimes accidentally doubles or halves the beats.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   So this can be a little confusing.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   So things that are like 60 BPM can be 120 or more, but...
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   - So it sounds like this, and then... - It hurts all.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.240]   [laughter]
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   Oh, man, we just sounded awful on this show.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   I can't believe anybody listened to that thing.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.240]   I like to say that I'd like to quit.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.240]   [laughter]
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   I want to take two weeks off. I want to think about it.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.240]   I'm doing that. I'm getting on a boat and sailing far, far away from here.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   When I come back, let's just see how it goes, okay?
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.240]   Tangerine, she's all they claim.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.240]   Her their eyes of night and lips as bright as flame.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   [laughter]
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.240]   Tangerine, when she dances by,
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.240]   she's a senior Rita Stare, and Kallen.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   I think it's only appropriate that we follow the best show we ever did with the worst show.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   I think so.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.240]   Anyway, so disco, Tangerine.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.240]   Alex, you want to...
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   I have one.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   Yes, sir.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   But I haven't even used it yet.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   I'm so excited about it.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   That'll be good.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   It is so...
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.240]   I know not many people use it.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.240]   It's kind of like the same thing with disco.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   A lot of people haven't used it because you can't get it.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.240]   Well, this one's still in beta, but I am super excited.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   We're going to talk a little bit more about it in this week in media,
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   but it's called ScopeBox, and it's www.scopebox.com.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:04.240]   This is for people doing video work.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   This is a huge app.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   One of the problems...
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   What this does is this gives you professional scopes.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   You know, like the scopes that we would see on...
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   If you go to a TV network and you see all these little hardware scopes
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   that you spend thousands and thousands of dollars on.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   Hey, Alex.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   What's a scope?
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Scope.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   A scope is...
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   That's right.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   For those of us who live in a shoe box in the sense that...
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   What does a scope...
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   A scope is a measurement device for your video.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   What it does is it gives you levels.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   It gives you all the speed back.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   Is it going during?
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   So what happens is...
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   So it shows you gamut or something like that?
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Yeah, it shows you your gamut.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   It shows you how...
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   Whether things are too hot or too little.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   All the stuff...
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   The thing is that the only scopes that we really had up until now...
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:51.240]   There's one called DV Rack for the PC, but the only scopes we really had
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   are the ones that are built into Final Cut Pro right now.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.240]   And they are...
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.240]   They're okay.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   You know, they're like fine.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   And you can't get live RGB parade.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   And I know that 90% people don't have any idea what I'm talking about.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.440]   But you can't get this RGB parade, which is really, really important to me when you're
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.440]   doing green screen.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.240]   So anyway, it's a big deal that...
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.400]   And we were literally talking about internally, like we're going to write our own app that
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   does this.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:18.240]   And then Kenji actually said that...
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   He sent this out.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   And it is...
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   It's going to be hot.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   That's all I got to say.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.320]   So you definitely want to sign up there, but mailing list, you want to sign up to get
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.880]   on the beta because I'm really, really excited about it.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.600]   If you're into video, if you're not into video, if you're like Merlin, then don't
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   come on.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   You've seen a lot of the video?
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   You're not...
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   You're...
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   No.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   I could be into video.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   You just have to wear a sport.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   It's a very pretty sight.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   So it's a nice sight too.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   Okay, I have one.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   Yes, sir.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   Scott Born.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   Simplyheadlines.com.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Simplyheadlines.com.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:52.000]   I received an email from a person who reads my blog that said they really didn't
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   like RSS.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.640]   They preferred emailing.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.760]   Could I arrange to have my daily posts emailed to them?
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.880]   And I said, "Well, rather than trying to talk them into using RSS, I'll provide good
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.120]   customer service and try to solve their problem."
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.720]   In other words, I didn't take the Apple approach.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   You're a solution provider.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   I'm a solution provider.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.360]   So I did some research and I came upon this.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   Oh, it does it for you.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   That's cool.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   It does it for you.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.480]   So all you do is you send your RSS feed to Simplyheadlines.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.680]   They turn it into an email stream, which in turn is available for your readers if they
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:25.720]   click on the Simplyheadlines button, they can pick you up via email rather than via RSS.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.280]   I think that's actually kind of neat.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.360]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.480]   And I put it on all my blogs and people are clicking on it like crazy because some people
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.000]   just prefer to do the email thing.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.920]   Well, it's mostly the older people who frequent your blogs.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.200]   Yeah, the older people.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.600]   Anyone older than 25.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.120]   They don't like RSS.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.720]   Anyway, the cool thing about it is it looks like a little newspaper.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.840]   It takes all the RSS feeds and automatically drops them into a little newspaper style format
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.520]   so you're getting your daily paper.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   That's really cool.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   So that is my pick of the week.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   That's very cool.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.640]   And by the way, it's totally free.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   Is it?
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.880]   Totally in each and every way.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.880]   Stop right there, Scott.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.880]   There's no way this could be free.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.880]   This is free.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.080]   And now it is only half off.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   Well, seriously, if you act now, do they put ads in it?
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.080]   How do they monetize?
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.560]   They put ads in it?
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.760]   It's an advertising support.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   It's a monetize.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.560]   He did say monetize it.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   He says, "I can see it.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   You know what?
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   If you're coming on."
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.240]   I do want to say that I thought it was pretty interesting is that instead of saying that
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.680]   they were in beta, the title says, "The Simply Headlines.com Experiment."
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.880]   "Sparement's a good name."
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.240]   So maybe it was a takeoff on show is?
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.960]   Maybe it was a take off on the Jimi Hendrix experiment to tell that was supposed to be
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   experienced.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Sorry.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   Anyway, it's cool.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   So I check it out.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.120]   Simplyheadlines.com spelled just like it sounds.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.280]   So should I do this with, I don't know if I have anything that I would be.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   I wouldn't do it with, would it work with podcasts?
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   I'll see.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:54.000]   I don't think it would work with podcasts, but I think that it would probably work with
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.920]   anything else.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.160]   Anything else like a blog post that has an R. I said, "For instance, if you ran a little
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.200]   teeny, we need almost do nothing, no nothing, blog that no one ever heard of like 43 folders.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.080]   If you ran something like that, what else?"
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.120]   He said, "No, what I was going to do, it's funny."
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.360]   He said that's good because I was going to do something similar where I would just have
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.880]   a site that would just write to static files that would say write stuff down.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:22.360]   I would just go up every day and just wait for the money to pour in.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.480]   No, see like Merlin, if he did this, he would not only be top.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.480]   I'd have he simply headlines and I'd be complicated.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.520]   Yeah, it would be way more involved.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   It's cool.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.960]   I actually, I started using it sort of as my feed reader just because it was convenient
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   the way it presents the information.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.400]   Lee, I'm kind of high tonight but you already did yours.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.420]   Disco is yours.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.420]   Disco sucks.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.420]   Okay.
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.420]   Disco.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.420]   No, disco's right now burning all my porn to a DVD and it seems to be working quite well.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.240]   While we're talking, oh it's starting to smoke.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.600]   Oh my God.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   It's smoking.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.160]   Oh, that's very cool.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.640]   So get a screenshot.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.680]   Yeah, get a screenshot.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   Get a screenshot.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.100]   Okay, I've got to get a screenshot.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.100]   Okay, I've got to get a screenshot.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.100]   Okay.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.100]   Okay, okay.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.100]   Okay, okay, okay.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.100]   Okay, okay.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.700]   So, if you're friends call for help, please try to figure out how to do a screenshot.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.300]   Okay, well no, I want to put it over Alex's picture.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   Okay.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:19.820]   And then I don't know, you know, I don't know if Snapseed Pro will capture this or not.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.820]   So let's see.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.820]   Oh yeah, did it froze it.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.220]   Oh, you're going to love this out.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.860]   I'll send it to you right now.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.860]   This is good.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.460]   This is good because Alex's mouth is open.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.260]   And it kind of looks like he's surprised maybe that it's obviously so.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.820]   I'm so glad the camera is on your computer.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.940]   Are we going to wrap this one up soon so we can do the real podcast for tonight?
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.940]   I give up.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.740]   I'm such a dog.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.660]   You're ready for the cruise, aren't you, Leo?
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:47.460]   You know, really that's the whole problem is I didn't get my pizzas.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.940]   And I just pan for it right now.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.580]   Okay, so I'm going to send this to you, Alex, and you can see there's maybe a little bit
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.260]   better example of the smoke.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.420]   Uh oh.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:05.780]   Leo, we would wonder if you know that this could contain a virus.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.620]   It says it could contain a virus?
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.020]   No, no, I will edit this.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.020]   Let's see.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.740]   There's like 25 more smoke message on that.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.740]   See the smoke?
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.540]   And the thing is it's swirling and burning as it's going.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.340]   That's great.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.340]   It's amazing.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.340]   It really is.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.340]   I think it's worth the 15 miles.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.020]   A lot of times, Leo, people say, "Why should I buy a Mac?"
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.820]   It just seems like they're more awesome.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.540]   You can buy apps that smoke.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:33.500]   See, I think this is what a lot of Windows users are missing out on is that sometimes
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.900]   smoke comes out of the applications.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   I think this is really cool.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:39.900]   It absolutely is.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.900]   Yeah, actually, I'm sure that I'd buy one or two discs that way and then I'd go, "Okay,
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.900]   now I'm going to control click my folder and say, "Bread a disc."
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.900]   Oh man.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.300]   I'm not right, actually.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.700]   Is it time for me to tell you what I think about Windows yet?
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:58.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you've enjoyed this podcast.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.340]   I'm sorry it's only about 20 minutes long, but we just didn't have that much to say.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.180]   Yeah, slow week.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180]   Okay, slow week.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:10.700]   Come back next week and I promise not to edit out other good stuff because I won't be here.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, buy Mac.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.820]   Windows sucks.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.820]   So long suckers.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.820]   It didn't work very well.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.980]   Okay, one more time.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, buy Macs.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   Windows sucks.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.180]   So long suckers.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.020]   I don't think that's a very good close.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020]   Yeah, screw it in.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020]   Oh, boy.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:37.020]   All right, I'm pressing.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:45.620]   Go on, engine.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.820]   Now can I send you a file, right?
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.820]   Yeah, you can send me a file.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.820]   You can't do that.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.820]   I would just attach the file.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:55.020]   There's this thing called attached and you just attach the image.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020]   You can, you can come Google.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020]   You know what?
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020]   You guys should Google.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.020]   You can Google do that.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.020]   You can use that Google.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.020]   That Google does that.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.020]   Think of it this way.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020]   Think of it this way.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:08.020]   Let's say you're going to go and have a nice lunch with cafeteria.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.020]   It's kind of like how you put the jello on your tray and push it down.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.020]   It's a lot like that except you can eat it.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.020]   Got your Senka.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020]   You got your Kyle Wrenshaker.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:24.020]   Got your Kyle Wrenshaker.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   You got your Kyle Wrenshaker.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.180]   (upbeat music)
