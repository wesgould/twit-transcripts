[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the moment you've all been waiting for
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   where we get together and try to remember what happened in the past week
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   that had to do with Macitoshes and then quickly do some research on the air on the fly.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And there's nobody better at it than frankly, Merlin Mann from 43folders.com
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   in the Merlin Mann show.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's truly how I have the worst memory in the business.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I'm happy to sit with you, other aging Mac fans, and try to remember what happened.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I know something happened this week.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Andy and I come from the Chicago Sun Times and the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Hello, good evening and welcome.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'm sorry, you're the host, you're supposed to be welcoming people.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I totally overstepped my amount.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I'm giving you what it means.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That's okay, you can welcome people too.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   If you get to an off-x take, I'll be in the mail electronically.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I just remember to show it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I have a ham radio.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Alex Lindsay, ladies and gentlemen, from thepicksofcore.com.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hello.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Alex will be in charge of news today because he clearly is the most
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   drunk of all of us.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You know, we started drinking on some of our shows and we found that we were actually better.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You do.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You have a show about buzzing it up.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We do.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We do have a show about buzzing it up.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But we found that there's really a certain pacing to it because we shoot the show all day.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We shoot 12 episodes of cocktails on the fly.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The problem is that the best cocktails you've ever seen in your entire life.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We tried to get Alberta to...
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We could mix these with water because no one's going to know.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   She wouldn't do that.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   She wouldn't do that.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   There's no way she would allow that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Then we said, when we finished them, we said we just pour them down the sink because we can't drink them.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   She almost quit too.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Then we kind of had to drink them.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   What?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You have to drink them is what you're saying.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We actually have now come to bring stunt drinkers to the set.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You have to.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   You have to sign a waiver as a stunt person because you may fall down and hurt yourself as much as a stunt person would.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They get paid stale but they don't care.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Because we had the mistake the first couple of times of allowing the cameraman to drink.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's a very rocky, rocky kind of thing.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   When I first started in radio, I used to occasionally perform high and hallucinogens.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   But I have to say that was many, many years ago.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I have learned since then it's not a good idea.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I spent my afternoon reading "I'm a Lebowski, you're a Lebowski," the new Big Lebowski book.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Are you saying there's a book about the Big Lebowski now?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's really fun.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's anxious.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, let's not get started.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We can't get started on quotes because it's a family show.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I love Lebowski.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I can get you a toe.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But no, there's an interview with.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's an interview with almost all of the main cast and one of them is with Jeff Bridges.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Probably the best, certainly the most beautiful bowling movie ever made.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Absolutely.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   In the bowling genre, this really stands out for the quality.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And although you never actually see Jeff Lebowski, the dude, bowl through the entire movie.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   A little bit of trivia there.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   A little bit.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I've learned a lot today.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.500]   But I also learned he said that he was actually not high in the movie and he said exactly the
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.000]   same thing you did, which is that if you're a pro or what Alex said, if you're a pro, you
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   got to fake it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You can't do it.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You can't do it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But I'm actually curious because he sure seemed high throughout the movie.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He said he used sense memory and he was easy for a couple.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   All the clothes.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   All the clothes were his.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Those were his clothes.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's a guy movie.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I tried to show it to my wife.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   She didn't get it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I watch it monthly.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Does Madeline get it?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You know, it's like so many things like watching YouTube and like, you know, she suffers it.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah, she suffers it exactly.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Dick in the box.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   She liked it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's hard.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   My wife, not yours.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I can't speak for your wife.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You want to speak on this?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.640]   I was just going to say there are times when you just have to meet, match your arrogance
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   to somebody's ignorance and just insist that they like this movie.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   I was.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.000]   Andy, by the way, I might point out, is single.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It's more like I'm married to the entire world.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It would be a damn shame to deny this.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Here I'm gesturing here.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You make people watch it?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.500]   No, it says that when you find out that someone's not digging apocalypse now, it's like you don't
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.000]   let me know that because look, okay.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I know.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I know.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   If you've never seen heart of darkness, okay?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I know.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Just the fact that you don't do the Mise-onsie.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You don't do the Mise-onsie.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   They are totally.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Heart of darkness is amazing.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Don't you realize for 300 attacks, they won't have trouble for two years to make this movie.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.360]   You can't do it, though, Andy.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   I don't know about you, but I found-
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.320]   Up with the big Lebowski is you got to make somebody watch it six times.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.760]   You watch it once, you're like, whatever.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.120]   Well, I loved it the first time, but you're right.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   It grows on you.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   You get the same theater seating as clobbercar and just get the eyedrops handy.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   That's right.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.120]   Is that what you do?
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   You use the eye clamps?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   Nope.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   I found my wife's not fond of that.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   But she loves Beethoven.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.440]   All right, let's talk about Max.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.720]   We can't actually do an entire show of rattles.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   We need to talk about the Max.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.080]   Anything happen in the Mac world?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.040]   I actually have a question for Andy.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.560]   Just driving me crazy.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.800]   Andy, can I ask you a question?
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.680]   How did you get- How did you get MISTIC SD-1 to work with your with iMovie?
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.840]   Do you have to do anything special?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840]   Yes.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.960]   It involves taking the card out of the camera, putting it into a card reader, and then
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   watching IMO.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   See, I did that.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   I got no one.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.240]   Yeah, see, that's a scary sort of question because sometimes you get asked questions
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.200]   like that and you realize, "Well, it just worked for me.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.840]   I don't know what to tell you to do."
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   That's what I expected.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.360]   I thought that maybe I was being this crazy Mac user who- Okay, so to back up, I finally
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   got my Panasonic.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.560]   You know, when not finally I bought it over the weekend.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.400]   But even by the five, you bought the one.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   How about the one?
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   How come?
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   Because I ordered the five.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   I'm holding off, though.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.600]   You know, the five has- It's not available in September.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.320]   It's a minor thing.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   The five has one sixth inch- Three one sixth inch chips, and the one has three one quarter
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.040]   inch chips.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   And I believe that I'll end up with better low light performance on- Why is the five
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   better than the one- Why do they say act like the five's better than the one?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   Well, it does.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:29.200]   The five does have a native 1920 by 1080 sensor where the one has a 1440 by 1080 sensor.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.000]   We're talking about these new Panasonic cameras that record in this new AVCHD format.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   Apple was all cuckoo about them at the announcement.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   They're cool.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   They record on SD cards.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.960]   They're recording H.264.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.920]   Andy Sinis, all are still from his camera.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.960]   You got the SD-1, right, Andy?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.560]   I got the SD-1, even so that frame was down sampled to something like 980 by four something.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   Spectacular.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   Chris.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.600]   I wouldn't say that if I were out shooting my Nieces soccer game, if I wanted great pictures,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.040]   I'm not necessarily saying that I'd leave the SLR at home, but it would be a very, very
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.680]   credible solution to simply say, "I'm just going to shoot this all on high def," and
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.960]   then just pluck out individual frames like at print them.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.640]   And you get a high def video.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.880]   So the video quality is excellent.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   I mean, just superb.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.360]   I really think this is the ultimate capture device.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.440]   If you want to have one device that's on you, whether you want to, I mean, if you're the
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   one of these people who I want to take pictures and will take five megapixel pictures, or
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   I want to be able to record interviews for podcasts, or I want to shoot videos just for
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.680]   YouTube, or on the off chance that I actually catch something really, really great, I want
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.200]   to catch something that I can actually sell to a network, this is the one box that will
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.640]   actually capture anything you could possibly want to reproduce as media.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.600]   Merlin is now learning the bitter reality of what it means to buy audio-visual hardware,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   because he bought, of course, the Canon HV2.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   We were all crazy about that.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.080]   Be one, I mean, just recently.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.640]   You shot who in the what now?
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.320]   I don't understand like one word out of five.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.080]   The whole lot of letters.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.520]   And he was all excited about the high, and we were all excited about the high def quality
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.680]   of this $1,000 Canon camera.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   And now all of a sudden we're saying this is better.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.120]   I hate you people.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   You always do.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.880]   Let your hate flow young man.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.400]   So I, first of all, Alex, I do have a possible solution for you.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.480]   I've heard the same complaints about, for instance, the exact HD 2A that they weren't
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.680]   able to import from it until they formatted it.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.440]   So try formatting the card and then see if it works.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.360]   It may be that there's something going on there.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   Right now it's not showing up at all.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   It doesn't, it just doesn't show up.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.640]   Yeah, I think you need to format the card in the camera.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   I heard it.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   Okay.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.120]   Is that's not the card that came with the camera?
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.600]   You probably used it with some other stuff.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.120]   No, no, it came with the camera.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   Try formatting it and see if that helps.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.200]   That might also be a difference because I didn't use the card that came with the camera.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.920]   I had like an external like 8 gig card.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.080]   I'm going to, I've ordered a couple of 8 gig cards because that gives you two hours of
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.880]   recording time, right?
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.040]   And incidentally, if for nothing else, putting this in my Nikon SLR and seeing that number
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.480]   spin all the way to, oh, 10 megapixel RAW files, about 1000.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   That's amazing.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.560]   After that you're going to need a card.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.080]   My God, I'm in the future.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.360]   This is what the future looks like.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.680]   This is a momentous occasion for me because I leave for Africa tomorrow morning and I am
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   not taking any tapes, any film.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   Is that amazing?
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.080]   I mean, it's completely tiny little solid cards.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.000]   It's just a bunch of little pieces.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.720]   They're a hundred bucks for 8 gigs.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.280]   You could buy a couple of cards.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.680]   Now, I, but I want to kind of drill down on this SD one versus SD five because I just
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.880]   thought, well, five is four better.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   Right.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   Maybe not.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.280]   But is that I'm a little, I think that it, it may be better.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   It'll be more expensive.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.480]   You know, it'll be, you know, come out at $1,100.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   I bought this.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   It's a thousand.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   It's nine ninety nine.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Right.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.800]   I bought the SD one at seven forty nine from B and H. So, so it was nine sixty with FedEx
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.200]   and filter and eight gigs of memory.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.280]   So should I, the difference is the native resolution.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.000]   It now admittedly a bigger CCD is a, is a lot better.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.880]   Well, it's not a lot better.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   It is marginally better.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.040]   Better low light.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.560]   I felt like I was making a choice between some.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.400]   I am very sensitive to low light grain.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.320]   You know, so when things are dark, you will get a little bit grainier.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   And when you pack those pixels closer together on the sensor, they tend to be a little less
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.560]   sensitive in dark situations and a little bit more grainy.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.520]   So the size of the chip, when you have a one sixth inch chip instead of a one quarter
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.160]   inch chip, you are packing in its 1920 by 1080 instead of 1440 by 1080.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.280]   You're actually packing more pixels into a smaller area.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.600]   And the conventional wisdom is, is that's going to make it a little bit grainier because
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.520]   those pixels are smacking there.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.200]   They are smaller.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.120]   And so they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't tend to handle low light situations
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   as well.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   Now there's three chips on both of them, which makes it, you know, a little less of a problem.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.080]   And I was really concerned about making sure that I have as good a low light as possible
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.400]   because that seems to be the one place where most of my cameras fall apart if they're going
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   to fall apart.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   So, so that's why I chose that one.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   And it was a little less expensive.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.640]   I'm not, you know, I don't want to spend too much money on this camera because, you know,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.800]   I do look at it as my internet camera.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.760]   This is really for my internet blogs, you know, maybe I'm going to put more stuff on
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.400]   box.com, you know, that type of thing.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.320]   It's not going to be something that I'm planning to do production on, you know.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.440]   So we're, you know, we're in the process of, you know, we typically shoot.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.200]   I spent the whole day today shooting on a B1U, you know, out all day.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.880]   So, so the, so I'm still using those kind of things for production.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.640]   Of course, we have a 950 in the office.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.520]   And so this is just my little camera.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   I'm going to throw in the bag.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   I'm going to take to Africa.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.120]   I don't have to deal with any.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.720]   Do you think that the SD5 is a better camera?
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.080]   I think that they're probably about even, as I said, because if you're more sensitive
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.280]   to low light conditions, if you're worried about those dark areas and making sure that
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.040]   they have the least amount of grain you're going to get for the price, I think that you
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.880]   might be, you might be okay with an SD1.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.280]   I think that might be an edge.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.240]   But if that wasn't the case.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.960]   Any reason to spend more for the SD5?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.360]   Well, it is going to give you a, a, a, a 1920 by 1080 native resolution, which is a higher
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   resolution.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.640]   It's full HD.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.200]   It's interlaced.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   And but it's interlaced.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.880]   That's not progressive.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   It's not progressive.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   These cameras aren't progressive yet.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:38.600]   The one thing they don't have that the, that the, that the HV 20 has with the HV 20 will
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.880]   shoot a 24p image.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.720]   It does a little cheat of what we call a reverse pull down to do it, but it does pull a true
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.480]   24 progressive scan image from the HV 20.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.320]   Is that something you can't get with these, with these Panasonic yet?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.520]   Now, what happens is if you bring it into the new eye movie and it says, do you want
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.120]   to do a 960 by 540 project?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.080]   When you say yes, what it actually does is it just grabs half of it when interlaces,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.880]   you know, interlaces half the screen is on, on every other line.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.160]   And then the other half of the screen is on every other line.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.840]   When you say, I just want 960 by 540, it's just actually going to grab one of those fields,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.720]   squish it together and scale it and give you back that field.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.320]   And so you end up getting progressive scan when you do 960 by 540 in a way that you don't
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.760]   get if you do a full resolution.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.000]   So I'm wondering why I'm spending an extra 200 bucks for this five.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.720]   I mean, you're using an HD CSD one right now.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.800]   You think there's any reason to get to five?
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.560]   Well, again, I think that this is a good chance to get a different perspective because
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.440]   I am totally the other end of the, of the, of the, of the, right, sophistication spectrum.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.640]   I'm the guy who just wants to, you know, take pictures of whatever's going on and, you know,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.480]   maybe cut it together and have some, have some fun with it.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.280]   And I've seen, I've seen some respects.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.880]   I've seen some of the sample videos and I personally just can't see the difference between the
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   two.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.280]   Maybe it's just because I'm just so thrilled to be shooting such nice Chris PhD so easily.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.600]   And maybe again, my focus is on how easy it is to get data out of this, how to get them
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   out of it.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   I love the idea of not having a digitize.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.840]   I mean, I just digitize two, two tapes and it took, you know, it took a couple of hours
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.000]   in each and it just takes forever.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And this you just drag over.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.760]   And you know, it's not just with these HD cameras.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.120]   I mean, I have this, there are these companies that are now making these like flip video
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.320]   recorders that are these hundred dollar little like NPSE quality amp quarters.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.560]   They're like the disposable camcorders used to get at the drug store only, you know, for
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.280]   30 bucks you get, you get to keep it, you get to the thing.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   That's a very, very handy.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.160]   I don't know if you ever actually use one of these, but you flip the switch.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.120]   It out pops a USB connector.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.560]   It's the video you shoot is stored on the device.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.880]   It becomes sort of a flash storage device.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.400]   Not only that, but all the soft need to import the video and to edit it and cut it and turn
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   it into quick time or something.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   It's also there on the device.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.320]   So you can just take it to whatever friends computer you have at the beach house and start
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   editing it.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.360]   And just the simple fact that again, it takes about five minutes after I hope this thing
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.960]   up, I've got 45 minutes where the useful video to start playing with that in itself makes
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.880]   me want to shoot more video because I can't tell you how many times I've been paid money
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   to actually cut it together like a five minute, whatever on some event.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.360]   And it's like, oh God, but now I've got three hours for the video that's going to take
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.440]   me three hours to import and then three hours to manage it as opposed to.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   I agree.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440]   Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.760]   So Alex is the choice then between a better low light camera and lower resolution high
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.760]   resolution.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.880]   And I think that the issue is that because I plan to put most of the stuff on the Internet,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.640]   I think that resolution is not an issue.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.400]   I'm 60 by 540 is fine.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.480]   You know, if it goes down to that, I'm going to be able to live with that.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.720]   And so that's the issue that I have is that I don't really feel like I need the extra resolution
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.840]   for what I'm using the camera for.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   And I think that the other thing to remember is that most people will tell you that unless
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.840]   you have a monitor that is greater than, unless you have a screen that's greater than
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.360]   about 60 inches and you're closer than about 10 feet to the screen, you're not going to
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.040]   be able to tell the difference between 1280 and 720.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.280]   So 720p and 1920 by 1080.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.680]   So you literally need a really big screen and you need to be pretty close to it to be
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   able to really tell the sharpness difference for the average person.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.400]   And the five is black.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Sorry.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.880]   The five has a black body.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   Oh, oh, well, then never mind because I, you know, I was willing to pay.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   I want to pay.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.880]   People do that.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.560]   They pay a hundred bucks more for a black body.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.320]   So like on the math book is everything.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.520]   I don't, I'm going to pull back everything.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   All right.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.680]   Any, I, I'm glad to get that clarification because we talked about this last week and
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.920]   I think a lot of people were interested in that camera.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.400]   Let's talk about eye movie, which you talked about last week.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.600]   Pogue finally, David Pogue steps forward just a few days ago saying Apple takes a step back
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   with eye movie.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.840]   Now David does a lot of video production.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   I don't know if he uses Final Cut or eye movie, but I gather he uses eye movie a lot.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.240]   And he's not happy with the new eye movie.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.920]   Actually, it's kind of interesting we're talking about this right now because just, I talked
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.480]   to Apple like 45, for like a half hour, right before starting to record this because I mean,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   I'm starting to try to get eye movie.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.880]   And so I was talking a whole bunch of people and they're trying to, they're giving me the
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.600]   philosophy behind it.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.640]   And I'm, you know, I'm starting to really understand what Apple was going for with eye
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.680]   movie because, because again, I'm not the person who's trying to do professional video.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.040]   I'm the person who's trying to turn 60 minutes worth of video into a six minute, whatever
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.800]   that I can show to people.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.040]   And they raised a point that I actually wanted to follow up on.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.280]   I'm not sure if I, I'm not sure if I believe it because it seems so such an odd thing.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.720]   But they say the one of the reasons that motivated them to totally rethink how they
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.040]   do eye movie was that their belief that people simply are not editing video.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.760]   They just still think that it's too difficult.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.440]   It's not something that they're interested in doing that the explosion that happened in
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:11.000]   the individual photography has not happened to camcorders, partly because people just don't
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.720]   know what to do with all this video that they have.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   And so this was a direct, a direct answer to, well, let's make people want to edit video
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   now.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.200]   Do you think it's good achieving that?
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.560]   Well, again, once I started to purge my mind of everything that I knew about eye movie,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.200]   the previous eye movie, which was not a whole lot, I started to really enjoy the way that
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.840]   I've, there's no, if you, if you want to, if you want to compare the idea of again, taking
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.120]   the 60 minutes with the footage and making a rough cut, honestly, the old eye movie just
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.760]   is not in this race because it is so easy to scrub over the things you want.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.360]   You simply highlight what you want, drag it into the hopper.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360]   It's all cut together.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.440]   It's no more difficult than dragging and dropping text from a document and editing it that way.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.840]   Russ, I move it a little bit.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.640]   It's a little bit fiddly or that way.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   Is it still destructive?
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.880]   I mean, it's still like, I mean, you have, you have all you always, on the bottom half
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.920]   of the screen, you always have your, if you're just dealing with the 60 minutes that you,
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   that you just imported.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.400]   And of course, you can have multiple sessions here.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.640]   It's not that you're limited to just one import, but when you drag that stuff from the bottom
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.160]   into for lack of a better word, your timeline, the original video is still there.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.880]   So if you want to grab it again, if you want to delete it from the timeline and then start
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.280]   all over again, it's all still there.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   It's not destructive.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.720]   You don't have to re import everything because you didn't have the right idea the first time
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.280]   you try to edit this.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   Okay.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.960]   Let's say, Pogge says Apple told him, well, this is 1.0.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.120]   We're going to add back all these features that we took out as time goes by.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.160]   Did they say anything about that to you?
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   No, but then again, I think the conversation that from the column that I've read from Pogge
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.240]   had the conversation he had was way different than mine.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.840]   He was most, he seemed to be mostly trying to address specific, really cool features that
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.880]   are missing, like the old iMovie was much, much easier to manipulate audio.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.000]   We had a plug texture and really what Knapp will say, but okay, we did the new iMovie does
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.760]   not have those things, but we could always add those things in later on.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.680]   But he says there's no time on that.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.360]   So you have no idea how long your movie is, which is a good point.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   He says, as you say, there's no audio.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.080]   You only choose one piece of music to put behind the video.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   You can't address levels.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   But I think that's...
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.120]   I mean, I actually think that the elimination of the timeline is a good thing because again,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.280]   when it comes...
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   Most of the edits that I do, and again, I come here as a very consumer-oriented editor,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.600]   is not I need to cut on this frame and exactly this frame, but no, I want to cut to the kid
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   of...
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.480]   When he started, I'm going to cut away when the ball leaves the frame.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Not okay, now the ball isn't there, there, there, there, and cut it right there.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.640]   So the timeline is a great metaphor for that, but it's not a great metaphor for it.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.240]   Look, just get the kid swinging the ball, get the kid chasing after the ball, and then
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   get the play at the plate.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.320]   Please, can we go home now, I movie?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.400]   The new I movie is a great answer to that problem.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.800]   Better for that, certainly, yeah.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   What?
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.880]   And I have to admit, I plan to, as I go to Africa with this little camera and my little
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.680]   solid state capture system.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.960]   I'm pretty proficient.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.880]   I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I'm pretty proficient at Final Cut.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.840]   I do a lot of shows, but I'm planning to use the new I movie for all of it.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.080]   And the reason I'm going to do that is because I just want to hack stuff together.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.600]   I want it to be done really, really fast.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.440]   And by the time I get everything kind of set up in Final Cut, I could be done.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   And that's the...
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.800]   It is for, I still think, for a reporter on putting something up that's...
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.240]   If it works, if my tests work through the fall, when we do Macworld, when we have to
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   do 30 episodes in a week, we're just going to use this I movie because we can just sit
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.800]   there and just plow through this data really, really fast.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.640]   We can also, if we want, we can plow through it really quickly and then send it to Final
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   Cut via XML.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.520]   That's something that the new I movie does.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.280]   And then clean it up there if we want to do every work on every frame.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   That's pretty cool.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.640]   That's a lot of flexibility.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   And so I'm actually...
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.200]   And it adds to Apple's bottom line because you have to buy Final Cut, which some say,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.920]   that's the rationale for this.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.760]   I'm just saying, when we started fiddling around with Ben and I started fiddling around
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.120]   with this video show, I went out and bought the quote unquote quick start guide to Final
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.840]   Cut Pro, which was about two inches thick.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.160]   And I've never seen an application with so many, so much Chrome and so many options and
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   so many buttons.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.720]   And I know they're all valuable, but I totally get this as a consumer product.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.800]   I loved using iMovie.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.440]   I used it to make the phone guy episodes, but it was several episodes before I realized
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.720]   that version I was using was destructive and all my original stuff was actually getting
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.000]   creamed.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.720]   And so if that's non-destructive, but even easier to use, I totally agree.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.840]   I really see a market for that.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.040]   One click to put it on YouTube.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.640]   I mean, that's such a no-brainer to me.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.320]   They also wanted to point out that they're going to be putting out lots and lots of tutorial
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.720]   video in the coming weeks because they understand that a lot of people are going to have to
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.000]   start all over again, so to speak.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I'll talk.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.280]   I'm tied to the timeline metaphor.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   I'm kind of baffled.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.800]   I'm playing with iMovie and I'm going, "Oh, that's..."
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.720]   I mean, I imported some stuff and I played with it.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   I love the skimming.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.000]   I love the fact that it's there, but I keep thinking, "Where's my timeline?"
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.800]   I don't know what to do.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   So I guess...
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.240]   I wonder though, if again, Merlin, the guy who knows so much about business, I wonder
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:32.040]   if also Apple has much more to gain than to lose by differentiating the products further.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.680]   Rather than trying to add a lot of features to iMovie that make it more like Final Cut
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.120]   Pro, why not take out or change the features that make it confusing to people?
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.000]   So at the very first time they open it up, it's kind of easy to grok.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.680]   Yeah, I think that's probably true.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   I really do think that their one priority was to make it simpler.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.680]   One thing that really put me on their side was, and again, I'm not taking this as cost,
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.840]   but I need to double check this, but the idea that no people are not, in fact, becoming
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.760]   iMovie demons, they're actually...
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.800]   They're back in 1988 where they're, again, filling up a cassette and just using that cassette
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.960]   or maybe burning it to DVD, where if they're not being encouraged to edit something down,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.160]   and we all know the great thing about it, the other thing is that you can take 60 minutes...
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.440]   Your friends and your family will put up with anything that you shot of your kids,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.960]   so long as it's less than two minutes long.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.640]   And you start to see that press against that barrier for every minute you add on to it.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.680]   And so if you're going to teach a legion of people how to take 90% out of everything
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.000]   that they shoot, you're doing a great, great thing for society as a whole.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.960]   And it's just really amazing that there aren't people who are using iMovie, who are using
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.440]   online editing tools, that, again, we're still in the same boat that they were in 10 or 15
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.520]   years ago where I shot it, so I'm going to play it, and now here it is.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.360]   And if that is the goal, I really do think that that is Apple's goal for this product.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.240]   Nothing more simple than if people aren't using this the way that we intended to do,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.200]   that must mean that this version of iMovie is screwed up in some way.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   Let's start all over again.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   I didn't know you could go 104 miles in a Prius, but apparently you can.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.400]   Steve Wozniak admits that's exactly how fast he was going on i5 earlier this year.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.920]   He said it's because I was looking at the kilometer per hour speed.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.640]   I thought I was in metric, your honor.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.240]   Judge didn't buy it, find him 700 bucks.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   In feet per second, I was going even faster.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.360]   So he cut off, he cut off 700 dollar bills off the roll.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.600]   He got a fake play and sped away.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.400]   I wonder if he paid him in two dollar bills.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   Now that would be funny.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   Doesn't he carry a roll?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.360]   Doesn't he carry like sheets of money?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.120]   He carries sheets of two dollar bills.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.040]   What I want to know was the car in car mode or robot in fighter mode when he was pulled
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.960]   over.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.760]   He plays a game with himself with these two dollar bills that he has in a sheet.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.240]   His game is to get people to think they're counterfeit.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   They're not.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   They're legal.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.720]   Somehow he gets them from the mint.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.200]   He puts them on sheets and what he'll do is he'll cut them out and pay.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.000]   So cut out a two dollar bill.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.320]   He says things that, wait a minute.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.040]   These are accepted by the US government or the secret service.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.200]   It says it's okay.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   He tries to get people to go, these are counterfeit.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.480]   He actually enjoys that.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   Am I on any way?
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.640]   I think it'd be funny if he paid in two dollar bills.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.000]   What do these things you can do when you have lawyers?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   But it reminds me though, the GPS got me out of one speeding ticket.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.800]   I think for exactly the same way that was, try to get out of his speeding ticket.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   How's that?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.480]   Well, I had an old junker.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   It was like your classic Millennium Falcon, where it looked like junk on the outside, but
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   it had GPS.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   It had a computer.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.400]   I put all my money in the electronics as opposed to the card.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.800]   So got nailed for doing like 60 and a 45.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.960]   This was like when GPS's worked, all that well known.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.360]   And so my excuse when the cop pulled me over, really?
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.120]   Oh, well, you might know more than I do because my speedometer doesn't work after all.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.920]   I have to rely on this GPS box.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   The speed is.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.320]   And then he asked for an explanation.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.160]   So I gave him a 15 minute demo of how GPS worked.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.440]   Well, of course, if I'd locked on to Tucson, he's a lock on at least three satellites for
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   a 2D navigation.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.640]   He can lock onto a fourth satellite and also get you elevation and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.120]   And here's my breadcrumb channel.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.840]   By the time I got done with the demo, I think he sort of forgot why he pulled me over the
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   first place.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   Hey, let me go.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   Well, I was just doing all right.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.200]   He probably was on his way to a date with Kathy Griffin.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   Did you see that?
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.160]   She's the comedian who recently hosted the D list.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.800]   And I think this is according to Valley Wagg.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   Valley Wagg seems to be fascinated by who's dating home.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.400]   I remember when I was in junior high and I didn't have a girlfriend.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   I thought about that a lot too.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.840]   I like that because I think it's wonderful.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.200]   She's big other.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   She's energetic.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   I was talking about Valley Wagg.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   She's energetic.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   She's fun.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.520]   I think it's an exciting match.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   They belong together.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.040]   He's looking a lot like an Ewok.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   Attention.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   Steve Ewachniak.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.080]   He's getting very, very, very in the photo in the article you mentioned.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.320]   He's getting more and more E-walky.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   He's adorable.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   Okay.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.680]   But give him credit though.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.400]   This is like a frame grab from an interview.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.920]   Nobody can look good 30 frames per-- make sure that every frame of that 30 frame per
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   second over five minutes.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   I'll pass through that.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   Every time I'm on WebKit.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   Leo, Leo, what do we look like?
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   What do we look like on screen?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.720]   Uh, I don't know what-- Catchers-- Catchers mitt in a wig.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   That's you.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   People-- it's funny.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.280]   Every time I do a webcam, broadcast on Ustream, people say, boy, are you exhausted?
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.960]   You really got to get it more sleep.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   So--
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   HD is-- HD is hard on my large Irish face.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   Not looking for not looking for not looking for not looking for not looking for not looking
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.920]   for not looking for not looking for not looking for not looking for that.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.000]   So iPhone cracks.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.960]   Now, we should mention that Scott Boren is on a corporate jet somewhere and not available
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.600]   for the show today.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.560]   But in his place, I shall mention the iPhone.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.400]   You know, last week, I was going to hack the iPhone during the show.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.120]   And I chickened out because-- The steps.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.960]   And I just-- I thought I can't do this to my iPhone.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.240]   I like it too much.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.640]   Now there's a new way to do it that is reputedly easier to do.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   I don't know.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.520]   It still looks like a lot of steps to me.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.920]   You going to do it?
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920]   No.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.080]   Well, here's Gizmodo's article.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.520]   It says, "If you wanted to install native third party apps in your iPhone but you didn't
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.760]   have the necessary technical knowledge or courage, the newly updated iPhone installer.app makes
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.120]   it so easy, it'll be hard to resist.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.600]   Shall I read you the steps?"
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.520]   You know what you should do, Leo?
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.160]   You should get-- I know I happen to know for a fact Scott carries 11 extra phones with
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   him just in case he needs to drive someone to his order.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   You don't want to hit phones.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   There you go.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.800]   You know for bribes, public officials, he just carries a lot of extra phones.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.480]   You should get one of these phones and go screw with it and see if this works.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.240]   I hear he carries the iPhones in a sheet and we'll just cut them out as needed.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.880]   He just punches them out.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.640]   He's got a little sheet of them.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.280]   It says, "Download the installation fire.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   Connect your iPhone.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.720]   Deactivate the iPhone, automatic sync and iTunes.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.520]   Go to Utilities, find Terminal."
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   Oh, there you go.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   Here we go.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   Double click on Terminal.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:02.400]   In Terminal, go to the folder that contains the application installation script and run
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   it.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.760]   Get installer.sh.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.040]   The script will run asking you what version of firmware you have.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.520]   If you updated your phone, you'll have 101.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520]   If not select 101.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.880]   The script automatically downloads the necessary restore file from Apple servers when it's
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.120]   done, it'll prompt you to hold the home button and the power button to reset.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   When the message connect to iTunes appears, release the buttons and let the thing do its
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   magic.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.720]   It's pretty easy.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.600]   And then it adds an icon that says Installer.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   Has anybody, have you done this?
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Anybody?
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   I'm too scared.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.400]   See, any installation process that includes, allow the device to connect to a server you've
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   never heard of.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.320]   Download software, you have no idea, and run it on your device.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:53.080]   Just as we were going to our little microphones here, the 102 update just came out.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.520]   So I noticed a lot of people, there's a bunch out there.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.760]   I noticed my friend Dan was just saying that, for example, there's a whole bunch of like,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.400]   there's another hack out there right now where you can supposedly very easily add another
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   button.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   Yeah, that's what this does.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.240]   It adds a button to your bottom row.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   Yeah, to your bottom row.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   And so I mean, install apps.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.080]   And in fact, you now have to get a new app because you're going to have too many apps
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.680]   and your phone doesn't scroll.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   Okay, let's see.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.840]   iPhone software 102 bug fixes.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.600]   That's all they're saying, just bug fixes.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.760]   You know, I would do this on a spare phone or a friend's phone, but no way.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.560]   Because I could push something that would break.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   I would do it on stocks.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   I would totally do this on Scott's.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.400]   Yeah, I would do this on Scott's phones.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.480]   Yeah, he's got a vest.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.960]   He made a vest out of iPhones.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.400]   It's an oversized triple XL vest that he made for himself out of iPhone.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.080]   We have a lot of numbers.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.680]   So you have to decide what you're calling them about.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.160]   What part of his vest you want to ring?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   Exactly.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.520]   He doesn't have a cinema display.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.440]   He just has 40 tile iPhone.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   He's got a hip phone.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   That's only for calls.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   You should do this.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.240]   It should be like Scott, like Chuck Norris things for.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.480]   Yeah, we should.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   All right.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.400]   This is a challenge to our listeners.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.520]   We want a Scott Norris style list of Scott for Scott born.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:10.280]   Did I say Scott Norris Chuck Norris style list for our Scott born?
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.600]   And it could be, you know, Scott born uses an iPhone, but only to blind his opponents,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   that kind of thing.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.520]   I heard Scott has one iPhone that he just uses to dial the other iPhone.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.520]   He takes the edge of it and he just dials with it.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.200]   He's never actually spoken on it.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.160]   I love it.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.760]   Skype was out last week.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.840]   I missed a couple of podcasts as a result of it.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.360]   That's not a specifically a Mac story, but oh, look, my iPhone's updating.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.640]   But it's a Mac fan boy story.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.360]   Kill it, kill it.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.960]   Why what happened?
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Do we know what happened?
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   Yes, we do.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   Skype is Windows.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   Windows.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.040]   According to the according to the Skype blog, there was a big old Windows service update
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.520]   and when a metric bajillion Windows machines started at one time, I guess they all paint
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.160]   Skype as part of the restart.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.680]   So they were it was actually at a Nyle of service attack from Microsoft.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.360]   Long lines of the GOS.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.080]   The issue has now been identified explicitly within Skype.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.040]   We can confirm categorically that no malicious activities were attributed or that our user
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.160]   security was not at any point at risk.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.320]   And it was Microsoft's fault.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.280]   Well, I don't know if it's Microsoft.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.080]   But you know, the people who chose to buy Windows, I suppose it's their fault.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.720]   Oh, because it, oh, wait a minute.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.680]   So everybody rebooted at the same time and they all had Skype running.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.080]   And so they all tried to log on a Skype at the same time for 24 hours.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   Here's the lead.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.320]   Here's the lead on Thursday.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.000]   So this is from the Skype blog at about that Skype.com.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   On Thursday 16 August, the Skype peer-to-peer network became unstable and suffered a critical
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   disruption.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.720]   The disruption was triggered by a massive restart of our users' computers across the globe
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.520]   within a very short timeframe as they rebooted after receiving a routine set of patches
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.760]   through Windows Update.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.360]   That seems a flaw in Skype.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   They said as much.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.160]   They said it's something that they hadn't, I guess they hadn't prepared for something
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   like that to happen.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   They're working on it.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   They said it usually self-heels and I guess they're working to fix it.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Interesting.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.040]   I mean, you can't really blame, you can't blame Microsoft.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   They're pushing out updates.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.680]   What it is is there's so many Windows users is what it is.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.720]   There's too many Windows users.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.440]   And they're all using Skype.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.800]   It must be something to eliminate them.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   Message receipt.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   No more.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   You hear that listeners?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Take care of the Windows users.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   The Windows achievers.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.480]   It's kind of like everyone flushing at the same time.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.040]   Yeah, that old urban myth about the Super Bowl.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   Is that true?
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   That's an urban myth, right?
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   What does it tell us?
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   What is the myth?
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   The older admits used to be that during the one I heard was in New York City, during
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.560]   commercial breaks in the Super Bowl, the entire water system would become all screwed
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.400]   up because everybody flushed at the same time.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   Same time.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   Yeah, it's the Super Bowl effect.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   That makes sense.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Let's see what Snoop says.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.240]   See what Snoop says about the Skype effect.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   All right.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.800]   My iPhone is now rebooted after updating its firmware.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.120]   Does it feel better?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.200]   Well, the question is, is it going to act better?
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.480]   Has anybody done this already?
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   Now the planet in the middle of homes really is place-
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   It's just a const picture.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.760]   You know, I have to, by the way, I never did apologize for this.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.720]   You know, the last time we did this live update on the show, Scott and I went, "Wow, look,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.560]   it's changed the weather icon."
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.520]   So it reflects the actual weather and it just turned out that in fact, both of us, it was
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.600]   sunny in 73 degrees where we were.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.520]   You had this stop clock phenomenon.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   It was right.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.440]   Stop clock is right twice a day.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.560]   And if we did it exactly at 10.15, the clock would be right too.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.160]   We same camera outside Windows so that icon can update.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.640]   Okay, it sounds like you're having trouble getting your phone near the window.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   Let's try it again.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   It's not like...
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   Nope.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.080]   No, they finally implemented that GPS feature.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   Now they just, you aim it out the window and it uses pattern recognition compared with
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.640]   Google, Google, Google, or...
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.880]   Now it knows where you are.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   Perfect.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   Amazing.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   I think I just...
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.200]   According to Snopes, there is a claim that sewage systems of major cities have broken due
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.360]   to the tremendous number of toilets being flush simultaneously status.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   False.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   False.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   Okay.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   Wow.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   All right.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   Old face.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   Is there any...
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.200]   Let me ask you, Leo, is there any other podcast in America today where you can learn such
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.600]   a variety, you can learn about cameras, you don't understand, you can learn about fake
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.480]   toilet rumors, you can learn about Scott Born's vest.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.280]   Is there any other program in America?
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.960]   The guy with the backpack, Megan out of an old Apple.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.680]   I don't know if you guys saw that article.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   MacGassy.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   But...
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:37.040]   No, this is the only podcast in the world where you'll hear these things.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.640]   Because frankly, there's just not enough Mac News to keep us busy.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.600]   You get to hear people do go into information.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Yes.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   That's most of them.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.880]   Is this all that information that those Wall Street fat cats don't want you to know about?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:55.320]   I do wonder though, if we maybe thought there would be more Mac News every week than there
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.480]   really is and that in fact this podcast can't possibly exist.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   It's unsustainable.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.640]   It's just not sustainable.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.120]   I don't think it's sustainable.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   That's really...
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.280]   People say all about the rat holes and everything.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.000]   But the reason is because there's like three stories a week.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   We've done them all by the way.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.400]   There are no more stories unless you can come up with something.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.160]   I got some new headphones.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   You got new headphones?
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   Oh.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   I don't know what I mean.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   Stories about you.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   I'm at the Mac.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   That was important.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.880]   I got these new microphone headphones for the iPhone.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.440]   Oh, the V-Motas.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.800]   Oh, how do you like...
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.000]   Now the V-Motas don't have a mic on them though.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.520]   They have a mic I think.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.920]   Oh no, I know what they're missing.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   They don't have the intermittent...
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   The pause button.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   They don't have the next button.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   They don't have that.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   I was expecting that.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:46.480]   But they sound a lot better than the headphones that you get with the iPhone.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   I have...
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   Boom.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   But I'm really spoiled.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480]   I have these ultimate ear.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   That's the thing.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.520]   I want to be able to use my Etymotics.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   I've got to get that sure extension.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.040]   But they're like 99 bucks.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.880]   They're much nicer than what I had before and it's nice that they have a mic on them.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.880]   But they're a little...
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.600]   It's just slightly bassy and I'm a little spoiled as I said because I'm kind of addicted to
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   $300 or $400.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.920]   I'm using a 30 pair of replacement iPhone headphones from Rivet.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.320]   They're actually nice.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   And they're a lanyard style.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.320]   So you hang around your neck, which I like.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.000]   Sound quality slightly better than the iPod headphones.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.520]   It does have the mic button with the intermittent and the pause and the next and all that stuff.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.840]   I think I've got mutineers.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.680]   I love using mine as the kind of the douchey talk over the headset thing.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   I love that.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.520]   I love that I don't have to have a separate Bluetooth thing for that.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   I do love that.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   I agree with that.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.520]   They hurt my ears.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   I think I have mutineers.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.960]   No, they hurt everybody's ears.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.360]   So I know let's play a game called Let's Act Like It's Seven Weeks ago.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.440]   And since Merle and Nuh has an iPhone that you guys all had something weeks ago.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.640]   So is there a best practice?
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.240]   Is there a single, probably Griffin unit that you guys like for if you want regular
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   old headphones, how you adapt to the screwy head?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.720]   The only one I think that people should look at, although and Scott says that the Apple
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.880]   Store's album is this Shure adapter that adds a microphone and switch.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   And then you can use any headphones.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   So if you have a good set of headphones like Alex's Ultimate Ears or my Shure, my Etymotics
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.080]   or somebody's Shores, you can use those with the Shure adapter.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.800]   But of course, that's wired.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   There's more.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   Now there's even more wire.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.200]   How does it use what does it do for a microphone?
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.640]   It has its own microphone on it.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   So this little adapter allows you to use regular headphones and the adapter itself contains
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   a microphone.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   That sounds extremely douchey.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.640]   So you've got like three little things.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.240]   No, I'll be honest with you, the best, to me the best solution is to get to, you probably
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.920]   have a lot of these lying around from other iPods, the little ear muffs that come with
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   the other iPods.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.880]   But for some reason, unaccountably, don't come with the iPhone headphones.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.560]   Put those on, it adds a lot to the comfort level of the, and then finally you were bringing
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.320]   this up seven weeks ago.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   Hello.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   Case.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   What do you like for a case?
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   Have you landed?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.800]   You were, as I recall, as I was carving out my corny as with a paring knife, I remember
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   you.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   There was some buzzing sound.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.320]   Sorry, I'm talking about cases.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   Did you ever find a case that you love?
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.240]   Gentlemen, question to you.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.400]   I use the DLL Jam case that I like a lot.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.520]   It's the rubber case that has the cord management feature and it's cheap.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   I use the Marwear.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.640]   And it's another one that's really just a slightly larger than the actual iPhone.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.760]   So it just kind of pulls on like a socket.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.800]   And one of the things about Marwear is they actually make really good, really good, a
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.960]   little plastic covering for your iPod.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.560]   Yeah, I like Marwear stuff.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.120]   And so it actually is really custom.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.960]   Well, it was easy to put on and I got it on well and I don't have any air bubbles.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:49.000]   And I have to admit, after I put it on, it works so well because I just put the rubber
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.560]   casing around it.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.760]   And then I just had it in my, around my iPod and then I kind of took my iPod out and I
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.200]   have to admit about half the time I don't even have my, you know, half the time I have
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.400]   my iPod, you know, in it and half the time I have it out of it just by itself.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.680]   And a lot of it has to do with whether I'm wearing a pair of jeans because if you have
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.480]   a rubbery thing in your pocket, it's really hard to get out when someone calls, but on
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   half the time I have.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.640]   And I have to agree with you that the iPod without a case is just right for fitting and
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.520]   fitting your breast pocket, I think.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   It's smooth.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   I'm dropping it.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   I do.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.800]   That's why I keep the rubber one on a lot.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   What do you use, Andy?
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.200]   What do you have?
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.800]   People think I pull out my iPod from whatever pocket I've got it in and I don't have any
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.440]   sort of a wrapper on it.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.800]   And you don't use protection and people think you look at like I'm Charles Manson or something.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.160]   There's that half step back.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.640]   And I'm like, well, I mean, well, is it holding up well?
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.920]   It looks, it looks show room new.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   I mean, I'm not.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   I'm not.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   I'm not.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.320]   Yeah, I mean, I'm not careless with that.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.000]   I don't keep it in the same pocket as my car keys, but you know, give me five seconds
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.280]   with a with a rag and it'll look factories new.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.760]   I have to agree with you.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.600]   It helps very much that I am using a loaner from Apple.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.160]   I'm not sure if I'd be that brave, you know, with something that I have to go.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   I actually have to go pity poor pitiful thing.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.960]   I have to go buy an iPhone now in the next three weeks.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.440]   But I mean, it's some amaze.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.640]   It's just doesn't have to do this whole time.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   Of course.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.000]   He's writing a book on the iPhone.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.800]   You get a big, I think they get a little slack that way.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.240]   Actually, I was wondering if iPhone sales had been tanking because all of a sudden,
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.160]   AT&T offered me a loaner last week.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.400]   I thought, hmm, sales must be slow.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.800]   No, probably.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.600]   Probably because that again, most people got them for like, I think about a month or so.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.000]   Oh, these are the ones coming back from the A list.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.960]   So basically, it smells like David.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.360]   It's got it's got DP engraved on the back.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.680]   I can't understand that.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.720]   The same folks that the same folks who did P Diddy's line of fragrance is also doing the
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   Pope line of fragrance.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.360]   Also, all line of fragrance.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.320]   How can I get any sink any lower than B?
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.520]   Well, I guess if in seven weeks, somebody else gets an offer for review, then we know
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   they're on the C list.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.280]   Also, I know is I just got my last ever bill from Sprint and even paying my exorbitant,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.040]   go away and get out of the camp.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.480]   Oh, man, I can't wait to get rid of that.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.640]   Of course, in the final indignity now, I actually,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.920]   they're telling me I have to actually go into the store to pay my final bill.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.960]   They will not because now my phone, I don't have a number or any.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.720]   So it's like, you know, right up to the end, they like to give you the old screw G right
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.720]   up to the end.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   You're going to love AT&T.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   They're so much better.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.520]   I had a very good experience at the AT&T store.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.120]   You know, they were, they got special training for the iPhone because they changed a lot.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.400]   Yeah, they changed a lot.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.000]   I have to admit, my experience when I, when I was having trouble getting my iPhone to,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.480]   you know, the very first little setup problems that a lot of people had, I had about an eight
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.600]   hour of delay and I called the AT&T and I have to admit, I was kind of amazed because
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.240]   I've been used to Verizon, which is usually me being kicked to the curb, you know, pretty
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.640]   much immediately.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.080]   And I was pretty impressed, actually.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.440]   Well Europeans are going to be able to get their iPhones.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.000]   It looks like this year, T-Mobile, O2 and Orange are now, according to the financial times,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.040]   the official European launch partners, depending on where you are, T-Mobile, the Germany, Orange
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.000]   and France, O2 and the UK.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.280]   That's kind of what everybody thought, actually.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.000]   It's not much of a surprise.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.400]   And I bet it's going to be like $5 with a one year contract for them.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.360]   Yeah, don't you think?
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.280]   Every time, every time I'm in London, it's like, oh good.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.600]   So the phone that I almost spent six hundred dollars for unlocked is basically your free
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.440]   with activation phone for, for more.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   Okay, great.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.440]   Whatever.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.920]   You don't deserve nice phones in America because we've done nothing for society, which is true,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.560]   but still we deserve nice phones.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.400]   And then you go back to your apartment where you have your 20-megabit connection for $10
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.400]   a month.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.320]   I was every time, again, that's another truism.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:57.280]   Every time I'm in London, I spend the $38 American for one night of hotel internet access
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.000]   just to send lots of emails saying, you're not going to hear from me for the next eight
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   days.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And here's the reason why.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.720]   No, it's mostly in Asia.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.320]   Korea is the one that has the crazy fast access, right?
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.680]   Scandinavia also very good.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.320]   Korea is like a hundred megabits a second.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.760]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.080]   There is a case, I think, Shubi got it for the iPhone that is, is it the eye protect?
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.680]   It's it's eye shield.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.960]   It's the plastic, you know, it seals it in plastic.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.760]   And I've heard actually good things about it.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.520]   That's the heart plastic one?
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.920]   No, no, no, no, no, it's saw.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.840]   It's, you know, it's like a vinyl sheath, but you apply it.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.920]   You have to get the bubbles out.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.560]   They've made them for iPod, uh, iPods for a long time.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.720]   Sounds really creepy.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.960]   Yeah, it does.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.560]   It's like basically you're putting a scuba suit, a scuba suit for your plastic covers
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   on your sofa.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   Ew.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   But Shubi man, I don't know.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   He's a fan.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.440]   That's the sort of thing you have a mega man or something like that.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   I mean, no way.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   He's a fan.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   Well, anyway, I don't remember.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.800]   I want to say eye shield or eye protect.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.560]   Eye rubber.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   Eye rubber.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   I can't remember the exact name.

[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.240]   One reason I call it out here, it's not just because of Twitter, but it's really, really
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   well done.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.560]   It's very pretty and it looks just fantastic.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.400]   It works along the lines of the typical kind of iPhone E app, but it's not just that WAP
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.880]   style go for menu idea.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   It's really good looking.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.720]   It uses some Cany JavaScript to make it very app-like.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   I just think it's beautiful.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.920]   It's pockettweets.com, pio pocket and tweets to words.com.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   I have an iPhone.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.160]   Is this the one that came out right away?
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.800]   Because they were one of the first to have this app.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.400]   There was one called, I don't remember what I mean.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.120]   As you know, I avoided all of this as much as I could.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   So you were paying attention.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.480]   Yeah, I basically had to unfriend everybody on Twitter.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.800]   I had to unsubscribe from 20 RSS feeds.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.560]   So I deliberately missed the buzz.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.760]   So again, sorry if this is seven weeks late.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.400]   I'm only now slowly resubscribing and then very quickly unsubscribing in some cases.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.120]   No, but this one came out.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.920]   I think this was in the kind of the second wave.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.240]   I'm pretty sure my friend Bobby Anderson works on this.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.200]   Buzz Anderson's brother, boy genius.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.200]   I don't know.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   I just really like the way it looks.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.760]   I think the message behind all of this is I'm intrigued by the idea that an iPhone app
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.640]   can be more than just a WAP menu.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.920]   By really tuning it for what you can do with JavaScript on a Mac, you can do some
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.360]   or on an iPhone, you can do some pretty stuff.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.840]   I'm kicking myself right now because I had a really good program and it's on the other
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   computer.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.280]   I do not remember the name.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.200]   It came up because I'm using Lightroom now like crazy.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.880]   I really like it for getting my raw photos in and processing.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.240]   I played with Aputure for a while and Lightroom really does it for me.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.640]   I still use Photoshop but for kind of mass processing of raw photos.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   I just love Lightroom.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.280]   Do you like to use the magic of editing to pretend that you...
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.400]   Yeah, it actually looked like a good picture.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   No, no.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.720]   Do you want to go walk over to your other computer and find out?
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.440]   No, I can't get the other computers at home.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.240]   But the program that I wanted to recommend, the issue was I've used the Flickr X uploader
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.800]   for a long time on the iPhone.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.880]   There's a really great exporting program for Flickr.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.360]   Frazier Spears.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.360]   Yes.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.680]   What's the name of that?
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   It's called Flickr X-Porter.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.400]   Flickr, Flickr, Uploader for something like that.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.320]   Yeah, but I'm pretty sure Frazier is company.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   It is.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   Frazier.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   That's the one.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.520]   And I was looking for something like that for Lightroom.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.120]   And I found one and it's fantastic.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.040]   I can't remember the name.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.920]   It's not free, but it's not expensive.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.560]   Actually it is free if you just want to export to one thing.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.120]   But it does Flickr.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.600]   It does a lot of different photosites.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   Is it Lightstock?
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.960]   Yeah, I think it might be Lightstock.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   No, that's not it.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.320]   I'm looking for it and I can't remember the name.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.280]   I'll just have to save it for next week.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   Dang, Nabbit.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.280]   But it's a great little program.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.480]   And of course I'll get a lot of email in about three hours.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.720]   Oh, you mean yes?
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.840]   You know that one.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.760]   But it's a great little program free if you just want to upload to one place.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.920]   So if you just want to go to Flickr from Lightroom, that's free.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.640]   And if you want to have multiple locales, you can.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.880]   But it does a great job of taking what's in Lightroom.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.320]   And obviously you can't send a raw to Flickr.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.640]   So it'll JPEG it.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.920]   It'll add tags based on your Lightroom tags.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   And it does a great job.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   Makes it very easy.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.040]   And I've been using it to upload to Flickr now for some time.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.720]   And I've been very happy with it.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720]   I see.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720]   I wonder if it tags.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.720]   I should look on my Flickr.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.160]   I wonder if it in any way.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.760]   Does this ring a bell to anybody?
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:01.760]   No.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.640]   No, never mind.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.520]   That's how I uploaded my last few photos.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.560]   I wonder if it says, "How did I upload it?"
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.960]   It doesn't say.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.440]   Oh, more properties.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.360]   See if it says in more properties.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360]   No.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.400]   Well, I'll just have to save this for next week.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.600]   I do thank you all for joining us.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.560]   And we are glad you were back, Merlin.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   We missed you last week.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   How'd it go?
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   Go go.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   Go go.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560]   Go go.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560]   Oh, last week was Apple.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   I mean, Apple.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.360]   Yeah, yeah, it went really well.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.360]   It's, boy, it's weird.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.160]   It's like getting to sing in the bathroom at Graceland or something.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.520]   Like getting to go to Apple, man.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520]   Wow.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   That was cool.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.080]   You were in four infinite loop.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.360]   I was in four infinite loop where there was no edge access.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360]   That's cracked me up.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.080]   I saw your, I saw your tweet.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.560]   How did you upload that tweet if there's no edge access?
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560]   I don't understand.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560]   Ah, there is a public AP.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.800]   And lots of Apple people do recommend that you go let me know what the open AP was.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.600]   But that's a hell of a place they got there.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   A lot of smart people.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.080]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.080]   Google or Apple?
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.600]   Oh, Google got an A's for them.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.840]   No, Google too.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.560]   No, Google, man, those guys are brainiacs.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   That's the bat.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.480]   It's not Mary Ann and Ginger anymore.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480]   It's Google or Apple.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.840]   No, it's Mary Ann and more Mary Ann.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.200]   All right.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.040]   So we're glad you're back.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.680]   We'll see you again next week.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.840]   And I need to scare people.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.680]   Apparently I scared some people by saying that Merlin was going to take a little time
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.120]   off, but that won't be till October.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.200]   It's so hard to find stuff about me on the internet.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.840]   I realize why there'd be a panic.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.760]   There was a sudden panic.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.200]   That sex change operation has been delayed.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.040]   He doesn't have to go to Helsinki until October.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.880]   Annie and Akko is at CW.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.120]   Actually, I got to remember to say this, www.cwob.com.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120]   There you go.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   It's not one of those del.cwob.is.whatever.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:52.320]   You can't leave off the dub dub dub though, I found out.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Really?
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   Or else what happens?
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   You get some cross and streams and those busters or something?
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.840]   Yeah, it's like, let me try it.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   Cwob.com.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   It doesn't work.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   Go see.cwob.com.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840]   You have to go www.cwob.com.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]   You might want to talk to your service provider about that.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   We'll talk to America about it.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   Hey, speaking of talk to America, can I get one?
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.840]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:16.360]   You're going to be on TV.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.880]   I was going to be on the TV on Saturday morning on CBS doing a, I'm basically doing like a
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.040]   Mythbusters sort of test of cell phones on what you should do with your cell phone after
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.140]   it crops on the toilet.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:32.380]   Before you run through the wash or anything else you're not really supposed to do with
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.480]   the cell phone unless you want to go back to the store and say, "It just stopped working.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.720]   I don't know what happened."
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.280]   As a stripping, dripping, dripping water onto the counter.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.360]   And so I'm testing out like, like T-Mobile, God bless T-Mobile.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:49.120]   I email them saying, "I want to destroy about a half dozen phones of yours on television."
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.560]   And they send me a half dozen working identical phones.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.360]   So we'll have like consistency from data to data.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.680]   So I have like five different urban ledges I want to test.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:03.100]   I'm imploring the mighty, mighty Mac Break Weekly audience to send me other ideas, things
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.860]   that they've heard of that doesn't matter if you've tried or if it actually works or
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.020]   not, things you've heard of on ways to resurrect electronics, personal electronics that have
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.220]   gotten wet.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.260]   Things like soaking it in vodka, you know, burying it in rice, all these other, all these other
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.260]   sort of stuff.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.340]   No matter how bizarre it is, I want to know about it because I'm hoping to do this again
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   sometime.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.300]   I can give you an actual story that happened to me.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.300]   Okay.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.000]   I knew brand new cell phone.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.880]   It was a T-Mobile SDA in my pocket and I bent over the toilet.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.280]   Won't say why I bent over the toilet, but it slid right out of the pocket, right?
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   Oh, man.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.260]   In fact, I'll never forget being in a urinal and seeing that happen to somebody.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.940]   The guy was on the phone and he slips and it drops into the urinal and everybody's laughing
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:51.280]   because they're mad at the guy for being on the phone anyway.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.900]   So it's very satisfying to watch him try to decide whether he should put his hand into
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:00.500]   the full urinal or just say goodbye.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.820]   You know, I'm probably in this.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.180]   In this case, the toilet, there was nothing in, you know, the toilet had not been used.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:13.540]   So I reached in, immediately took out the battery, got everything out that I could let
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.240]   it air dry and it worked again in about three days, but I didn't, you know, I let it air
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.420]   dry completely before I used it again.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   That's the boring one.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.420]   I know.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.620]   One as a control and just air drying it, but let's see, the more that I tried, the more
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.580]   I went looking for these stories, I only had like three or four that I could remember
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.540]   and I found like three or four more.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.940]   Don't microwave it.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.940]   That would be bad.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:35.940]   That would be cool.
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.340]   Wouldn't be bad on the phone, but it's cool for your YouTube.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.460]   I think for CBS, you should definitely have a microwave on the set and try one in the
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.460]   microwave.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.860]   I guess they're microwave.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.860]   Someone else's phone.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   You could be real.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.060]   You can be demonstrated with iPhone skins, you could be a brave, brave SOB with other
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.060]   people's hardware.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.660]   You can be friends frickin' valiant, so long as there's a phoenix left waiting for you.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.860]   Thanks for the water.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   I'll call them.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.860]   I've got a bunch of other brilliant ideas.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.500]   I think all the pieces are here still here.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.300]   So how should people communicate their stories to you?
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.300]   Email me.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:17.740]   My email address is ai@andii.com or if you go to cwob.com you'll get all my email addresses.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.660]   Like I said, keep them common because I have a feeling that I can find people who can
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.940]   give me at six packs of all kinds of cool things to destroy via water, so long as I
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.060]   keep coming up with ways to try to resurrect them.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.100]   Oh, you want this as a continuing piece.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.260]   I'm hoping to make this into a franchise.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.260]   He's the guy.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.260]   He's the guy who destroyed stuff in water.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.260]   Yes, we can.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.100]   Don't return his phone call.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.500]   Everybody at Apple, don't return his phone call.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.740]   He'll ask for an iMac.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.980]   He's just going to throw it off of something.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   Like it.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.980]   That's good.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:52.660]   Turns out that above three stories, the Apple logo splinters.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:58.100]   Too bad the blender thing's been done because that's good video.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.700]   The best one is with the iPhone when it turns into smoke.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:01.700]   It turns black.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   You don't even know what happened.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.540]   It's just grinding and suddenly it's just like, well, it proves it actually is magic.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.540]   The magic smoke.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.620]   I think that UI work.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.980]   Don't inhale the smoke, whatever you do.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:12.980]   Yes.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.140]   Unless you want to see some magical pixies.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.380]   Carry you off.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:23.020]   Once again, Alex Lindsey is at the pixel core.com and that's a great place to go if you want
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.180]   to get involved in all of this exciting creativity on the net and maybe even make a living doing
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.180]   it.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.540]   That's P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:32.940]   And people can also check me out.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.540]   I'm going to be in Africa next week.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.300]   I won't be on the show.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   Okay.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.580]   But if I go to AlexLindsay.box.com, I'll start probably posting tomorrow of my harrowing
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:50.580]   travels from here to New York to Senegal to Johannesburg and then finally to Harare's
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.580]   in Zimbabwe.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.660]   So I'll put some pictures up whenever I get some connectivity.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.660]   And our congratulations to Steve Jobs, who has been inducted into the California Hall
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.740]   of Fame this week.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.740]   Talk about pathetic.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.220]   I'm proud to be an American.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220]   I didn't even know.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.420]   I didn't even know that there was a California Hall of Fame.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   It started last year.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   It started last year.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.540]   Well, I wasn't going to brag, but I got three emails last.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.060]   Last week saying that I was a winner.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.060]   There you go.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.460]   You see you are a winner.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.460]   You're all winners.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.300]   Little Lebowski achievers.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.300]   That's right.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.860]   Do you have a final Lebowski quote for us, Mr. Merlin, man?
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.700]   Is this your homework, Larry?
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.060]   Is this your homework, Larry?
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.860]   Filling your father, Larry.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.180]   That was already an an iron lung.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:39.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, another Mac break is broke.
