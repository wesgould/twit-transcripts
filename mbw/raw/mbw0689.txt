[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. What a panel today. Dave Hamilton's back from Mac Geek
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   Gab. We've got Andy Anaco from WGBH in Boston, Renee Richie from iMOR and the return of
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   Alex Lindsey. And there is a lot to talk about, including Apple's congressional testimony.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.600]   Did they lie? We'll talk about the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, my kind of final thoughts about
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.720]   that. And what went wrong with iOS 13 and what is Apple going to do to fix it next time?
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.800]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.680]   Apple Renee Richie's joining us from imore.com and beautiful Montreal. I think the frost
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.200]   is on the pumpkin. At least it's on your beard. I don't know. Is it cold out there?
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.960]   I mean my river is freezing. It never makes me happy. It looks beautiful. But man is it
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.840]   chilly from frozen river Canada. Renee Richie. Annie Naco also joining us from his home in
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:32.800]   the frigid east. Yeah. Well now it's frigid for 2019. It's a frigid 59 58 57. What? It's
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.560]   warmer there than it is here. Yeah. I know. I'm not. I pre I pre set all my heating stuff
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400]   way too early. And now it's like I'm wearing I'm wearing this because I don't want to be
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   sweating. I don't want to show my question. Always the question in in New England. Should
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.440]   I is it time to turn the boiler on? You know your toilet on because once you turn on you
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.760]   don't want to just to run it all through the winter. You don't make any plans for Saturday
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.520]   when taking down the storm windows. Oh that's the other one. Storm windows. I just I just
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.440]   hope that we can get to them because remember that we had that snow blow out like by all
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.920]   the way in March. So we might have put that in front of the windows. Sometimes that is
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.040]   better. May as well. May as well get to the goddess. So long as we got the ladders up.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.000]   Now here in California, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Alex Lindsey in the house. Hey, Alex. Good
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   to see you. I just did the gutters this morning. Oh yeah. Did the gutters. There were a few
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.120]   leaves in them. There were wet. We wet. It was gross or wet leaves. We had a wet leaves.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   I don't know how we survive out here. I know it's we do have fires, but that's another
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.400]   matter entirely. Also joining us from the Mac observer, Mr. Dave Hamilton. Hey, Dave.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   Thanks for having me. Yeah. I clean my gutters on Saturday and it was just frozen enough
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.240]   where I could grab a sheet of ice. No, it made it really easy because it all just came
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.480]   out. It was cold, but you know, nice. You're in the state. I want to say is that where
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   you I'm in New Hampshire. I'm about an hour north of Andy. Yeah. Hampshire. Hampshire.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.640]   Just a shout out to all you kids out there. Cleaning gutters, putting up storm windows
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.520]   just part of what you can expect in our youth youth oriented back break. Because you don't
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.080]   want to get an ice there. Okay. I had that. I had those heated wires up in the up in the
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.320]   edge of the roof. Did absolutely Jack squat. You just got to get up to the lad in the push
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.360]   broom. Let's just tell them for the youngens. Birds don't exist. Birds aren't real. What
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.680]   is that Dave Hamilton? It's a movement. It's a it's an ironic conspiracy theory. You know
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.560]   me. I emotionally support all conspiracy theories. Intellectually, I can only support a few,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.320]   but emotionally, I cheer them all on. And we all do. Yeah. Yeah. This is one of the ones
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:57.760]   that I I love. Birds are surveillance drones, cleverly disguised as things previously known
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   as birds. A fleet of covert technological surveillance devices unlike anything the world
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   has ever seen. Says tricky. Dick Nixon, 1978. We call them birds. And apparently the dead
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.640]   giveaways during the government shutdown. Did you see any birds? Not many. Only only
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.200]   scabs only scab.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:28.520]   I know you got to do what you got to do, but you cross the line. I'm just saying you got
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.360]   to call that for it. So a few stories about Apple. How about what do you say? I just want
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:44.400]   to say loving the MacBook Pro 16 inch. Now I processed, I used it to process all my trip
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.640]   photos. And I was a little concerned because Lightroom is not notoriously fast. Even on
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.320]   the I'm at pro Lightroom is kind of a pig. And I knew I was taken with a new camera,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   which is 61 megabyte file 61 megapixel camera. And actually, I think the MacBook Pro processed
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.440]   a little faster than the I'm at pro it really I was able to go through them in real time.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.280]   I was really impressed. So we're getting good results. We've been all over Twitter lately,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.760]   especially YouTubers are rendering stuff four times faster. Notice going through Lightroom
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.600]   much faster. It's terrific.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.800]   I don't know if it's the GPU or the eight cores. I got the I nine, but it sure is sure
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.760]   seems to be eating up everything I can throw out. And yes, that keyboard it may not be,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.840]   you know, Andy's code keyboard, but it is a great laptop keyboard. I think better. Yeah.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.280]   Tyler Stalman posted his DaVinci Resolve export numbers today. And he would used to take a
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.320]   couple of hours to go from cannon raw light into ProRes. And it's like I'm in like 45
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.200]   minutes this time.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.960]   That's nice. I'm actually thrilled.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   So just to kind of follow up because, you know, we all do the first looks in the quick
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.160]   reviews, but you know, sometimes it takes a week or two or three or a month. I'm still
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.240]   I'm still letting it settle in. You haven't bought it? No, no, I don't buy new hardware
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.360]   I mean, not not computers that I actually have to work on. Come on now. Next month, there's
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:16.120]   going to be a computer with your name on it. Oh, no, I'm going to get one. Unless that
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.640]   enclosure is big enough to house a family of four in a kitchen. I don't know a lot of
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.360]   people are going to have to wait for that. That that new Mac Pro will be built in the
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:32.480]   brand new Mac factory in Texas. Thank you, Don. Yeah. No, says the New York Times always,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.000]   you know, always the killjoy New York Times that Mac factory in Texas is not new. It's
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.440]   been making Macs there since 2013. And it's not apples, right? It's flex. It's not even
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.240]   apples. And it's just and it's assembling parts that were manufactured in China. But
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.400]   hey, but remember we were saying, watch Tim's face while he's standing with the president
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:01.920]   and just just to see if his expression. No, the Times actually was a little bit snarky
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:10.520]   at the last paragraph of the story in the New York Times reads on Wednesday, Mr. Trump
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   called Mr. Cook a very special person because of his ability to create jobs. He turned to
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.600]   Mr. Cook and said, what would you say about our economy compared to everybody else? Mr.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.800]   Cook replied, I think we have the strongest economy in the world. Strongest in the world,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.400]   Mr. Trump said the president then took questions on the impeachment inquiry and launched into
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.920]   the tirade against the fake press. Mr. Cook stood silently nearby.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.520]   Yeah, a little shade, a little shade from the New York Times, probably somewhere between
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.160]   that and a pile driver would have been the most acceptable. I feel sorry for him. I hope
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.200]   that I also I hope that I live long enough to read his memoirs after he's decided to
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   retire from Apple so we could talk about that sort of stuff doesn't mean that he doesn't
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.280]   have to spend his time in the dunking booth after that because that's the price of the
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.840]   deal that he's made. But yeah, we all knew that this is going to be a horrible, horrible
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   day for Tim to have to stand next to Donald Trump and a live mic where people are asking
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:17.800]   him questions that Trump announced that this was a brand new factories. He said, you know,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.240]   you know, we're here opening this new factory. And you know, by the way, I should point out
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.880]   that happens politicians, they fly in, Mr. President's a brand new factory. We're going
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.960]   to do it and they just say that. So I'm not sure I could blame Trump for that one. And
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.600]   there is a brand new campus being built. There is a new campus with 15,000 new employees
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.960]   in Austin. In fact, they broke ground on that just the other day. But I feel kind of sorry
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.360]   for Tim who's, you know, hearing this knowing it's not true. And I guess nobody dares. Nobody
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.600]   he didn't dare say, Oh, it's it's it's an old factory. But he's still he's still on the
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.360]   hook for this is not this is not like a politician promoting a certain policy or promoting the
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.440]   American economy, which is usually how these things happen to work. It reflects well in
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.280]   the president that's fine to or the senator who's opening this factory. But this is it's
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.880]   usually about here's how strong the American economy is here's how many factories coming
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.040]   back to the United States, whether that's true or not. But when you are using it, when
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.320]   you know that a politician is going to be using your your facility and your company and your
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.360]   prestige as a promotional thing to promote to send untruths to this politicians followers,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.520]   it's doubly disappointing that Apple doesn't find some way to not send a press release
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.240]   and correction to Mr. President's statements. But at least to say we're very, very happy
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:48.200]   of the work we've done in this facility since 2013, with all the employees that and it's
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.160]   it's very, very disappointing. It's the state of the world. People are really afraid of
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.200]   a tweet from Trump and they just don't want to have the CEO of flex mark. Never never
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.560]   stand up for a principal unless you have no fear whatsoever about about this habit on
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.200]   Twitter and Sunday and and and at least one panel said, look, he's doing his job. He's
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.760]   a CEO. He's got a fiduciary responsibility of the shareholders and to do the best for
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.600]   Apple that that having this be smoother is worth billions to Apple. Yeah, it's easy
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.800]   to say that it's easy to be high mighty about what what he's doing when you don't have a
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.400]   company that needs, you know, that it's terrifying because literally literally all of this
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.720]   though, literally the president could in a tweet on his way home say and the tariffs
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.960]   are back on and all of a sudden Apple's really in trouble. Yeah. So and also the president
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.680]   of the CEO of a company being terrified of the retribution of a president who takes
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.160]   a personal attack and is individual power. That's not a good thing. I see again, I don't
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.120]   I will not cast as persons on Tim Cook's character, but this is it's and I do agree
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.440]   with the fact that you have so many jobs that's that you're in control of. You have not let's
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.480]   let's not even talk about responsibility to shareholders. You talk about people who actually
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.880]   count on Apple even as a subcontract to make their living from. However, that part of that
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.920]   responsibility includes that again, you have to do the stuff means that you can't you have
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.840]   to sit in the dunking booth for a while and not complain about it because it's other people's
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.680]   jobs, journalists, people like us to point out that this was what was said in front of
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.840]   Tim in Tim's Tim Cook's president was not only true, it was not even half true is absolutely
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.560]   not true and Apple did not choose to correct that statement. Again, you have to sit in
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.160]   the dancing booth at some point, you towel off, you accept that this is something that
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.520]   this is part of the deal is part of the gig. Well, but that's I mean, and you're right,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   it's part of the gig. That's exactly it is he knew that people would offer this correction
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.480]   and he could get away with not having to offer it and not being the one that's getting
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.120]   you know, retribution or anything like that. That's a good point. That's that's that's
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.040]   being that's being very generous. I won't I'm I'm I'm at that I'm trying to find that
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.480]   balance point between not trying to villainize someone for being in a bad position that they
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.920]   felt this is what they had to do and not trying to idolize them for doing something
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.720]   or not not trying to give them a free pass for recognizing that there was a brave thing,
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.560]   a risky thing that could have done that they chose not to do. I'm saying I'm not going
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.640]   to praise them for saying well, you know, what could they have done? Well, again, he
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.720]   could have found a way under the under official Apple statement, read to correct this stuff
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.120]   to make their positions very, very clear on where their interests overlap with the countries
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.720]   and with Trump's and where their interests overlap with the population and not necessarily
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.480]   the government and this they declined to do again that doesn't demonize them. But I'm
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.840]   not going to say well, what what could they have done? Again, they could have done something
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.320]   very, very brave, which would have been very brave and very risky. But they I'm not going
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.560]   to say that it was a plotable, a laudable thing that they did not do the brave thing.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.360]   Well, it's but should they have? But because by the time they want to keep talking about
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:02.400]   this, okay, okay. However, this is not brave. Apple has told Congress. In fact, they did
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.840]   this the day before you'll hurt yourself if you try to fix your iPhone. This is this
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.560]   is from motherboard. Apple testifying actually was their vice president of corporate law,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:21.800]   Kyle and dear testifying before Congress over right to repair. Apple repeatedly denied
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.080]   accusations. It was making it hard for people to repair their own phones and protecting
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.240]   a virtual repair monopoly. But as motherboard points out, a lot of what Apple said just
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.120]   doesn't jibe. For instance, they said the phone is too technical for the average person
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.920]   to repair without special training. Training, which of course, Apple refuses to give them
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.040]   that doing such repairs could be dangerous. That's not untrue. You put you put a battery
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.960]   in there wrong. It could be a problem. And then it costs Apple more money to do repairs
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:01.200]   than they charge. That might be a little bit of a fib. They claimed that they lose money
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.600]   on repairs. A number of third party repair company said, Well, I don't know how that's
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.880]   possible. We charge less and make money. So how is Apple losing money? And the speculation
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   is Apple's including the cost to numerous recalls in the money that they're losing.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.160]   Also, the little repair shop, the cost of employment for a small repair shop is going
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.480]   to be very different than Apple. When you talk about there, when you talk about health insurance
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.160]   and all the other things and probably a higher salary and so on and so forth, the people
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.360]   who are working there. You think it really Apple loses money on repairs? I don't know
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.960]   whether it does or not, but I can tell you that I look at the number that they're doing.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.760]   I couldn't do it at that price. I couldn't manage that process at the price that Apple's
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.840]   doing it at. As someone who has to figure out how much things cost, when I think about
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.240]   the amount of time and the number of people that handle it and how it comes out, they're
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.920]   not making a huge profit on it. If they're making any money on it, this isn't a profit
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.520]   center for Apple. I just really don't buy. So you said when Apple says, We don't want
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.920]   third party repair companies to repair our stuff, they're really saying it because it's
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.880]   unsafe for the people. I think they're managing liability because of the issue is that the
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.200]   chances of an average person being able to put their phone back together and have it
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.560]   work well is low. Now, I'm not talking about a techie person like us. We're saying an average
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   person. No, but the right to repair extends to third party repair shops. Right. Exactly.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.520]   Right. I'm fine with that. As long as the third party repair shop registers that phone
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   that we've worked on this phone and we take liability. If anything goes wrong with this
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.160]   phone, so Apple can give that to a third party as long as they they. In fact, Apple has,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   and I should point out, just recently started training in parts to certain third parties
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   to what I proved third parties. But I think that what's important is for every phone that
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.720]   that third party works on, that that serial number goes in as we worked on this phone.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.320]   This is what we did to this phone. So the way that the consumer knows that. Yeah, but
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.880]   no, but when the phone catches fire on a plane, no one's going to know when you think about
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.960]   the PR impact of that. No one's going to know whether it was replaced or not. No one
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.600]   knows whether somebody worked on it or if someone worked, all they know is that an Apple
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:19.080]   product caught fire. And I am very sensitive to this because whatever happened to 2015
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:25.760]   laptop, I couldn't fly with it. So you think Apple charges $549 to fix the glass back
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:33.280]   of an iPhone that they're losing money? $549. I don't know because I don't know what it
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.320]   takes to do that. I don't know what kind of glass I don't know whether it's there. I
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.960]   don't know. All I know is that if I spend $1,000 for a phone, and the Apple's were offering
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.840]   a replacement or a repair fee that is more than I think I want to spend, and someone
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.080]   says, "Hey, I can fix it for $60. It's my phone. I bought it. I own it. I should be able to
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.880]   pay this person $606." And remember that we're not talking about me in my office trying
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.560]   to fix a component level repair on my own. We're usually talking about here is a person
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:10.200]   who I FedEx my phone or my laptop or my iPad to them. They FedEx it back in a week or two.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:18.240]   There's almost a, if you own a better example, I have a couple of typewriters that I actually
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   use a lot. And so there's a typewriter repair shop in Arlington, Massachusetts, Cambridge
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.240]   typewriter that does an amazingly good job. They are experts. They've decided to become
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.520]   experts on fixing all kinds of typewriters. But I don't think I can.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.040]   So I can, but again, iPhones are exactly the same way. There are YouTube channels of people
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.680]   who will do component level repairs and upgrades. Nintendo switches, people who will, there's
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.160]   parts that tend to fail like the chip that's right near the charger. There are people who
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.680]   are, who know how to replace just that discrete component. They don't have to charge you for
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.920]   an entirely new board or an entirely new device. So I just think that if third parties are
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.000]   not given, are not artificially blocked from access to learning how to fix these things.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.800]   Not an art of, and consumers are not artificially blocked from seeking, seeking repairs on a
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.680]   device that they own in whatever means that they want, they want to engage in. I just
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.480]   think that that's okay. There's nothing, nothing that's good for consumers.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.720]   I think Apple is starting to roll out a register, a system that third parties can actually do
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.800]   some repairs. I will say that I would never, ever have someone other than Apple work on
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.200]   my phone. It's like that is crazy. It is a crazy idea. It is stupid. It is a stupid idea.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.480]   It's not stupid. Apple's managing not only liability, but the customer experience, right?
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.720]   They want everyone to be delighted using their iPhone throughout their time using that iPhone.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:52.040]   And if you get some janky third party repair that's doing something that Apple would not
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:20:00.480]   do, well, you might might wind up with a repair that works for you, but isn't Apple's standard
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.960]   of here's what the iPhone experience should be or the MacBook or any experience.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:11.120]   It's just that there's so much where consumers, we're not children. That's all I'm saying.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:18.240]   We're not children. We want to be blamed for that exploding iPhone regardless of why it's
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.600]   exploding. By stupid people and they would be innocent. That's not a consumer problem.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.680]   If that repair shop is willing, if they register every phone, they work on it.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.800]   I think that's basically what's going on with this independent. So Apple has independent
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   repair program where you when repairs needed, you can go to an independent repair provider.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.040]   They've got Apple components. They have Apple training. They have Apple diagnostic tools.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.280]   I'm pretty sure Apple did this in response to the right to repair movement. They felt
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.720]   like it was it was hurting them. You know, it was bad PR that they looked like they were
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.600]   blocking this. But I think this this does job. I have to say, Alex, I'll give you some
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.760]   credit because it does jibe with your contention that Apple's not against you having third
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.840]   party repairs, but they want to make sure that they're done safely and properly.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.720]   We should not. The TSA is not making a big deal about batteries because they're not
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   a big deal. Like they're not. But airlines. I got to tell you, I couldn't
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.000]   when I'm saying all the airlines in TSA, the reason they're worried about that is high
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.480]   capacity batteries. The batteries that we're doing as we get more and more time on a smaller
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.360]   and smaller space, you've been on a plane. I've been on a plane recently where they say
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.880]   if you lose your phone in the seat, please move it. Do not move your seat. Call a flight
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   attendant because they're afraid of people moving the seat, crushing the phone and causing
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.240]   a fire. And when I was in Asia a month ago, when I was in Cambodia and India on every
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.880]   screen all the way down, it says you cannot take a Mac, an Apple Mac MacBook Pro 2015
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.560]   onto this flight. You can't check it. You can't carry it on. You can't specific said that
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:00.040]   there. And that is what I saw when I saw that. It was like, that is horrible PR to have to
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:06.520]   have every airline across an entire airport have this huge LED wall that says you can't
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   take your computer on. That's what that's the kind of stuff that and that's when it's
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   sunk in for me. That's what Apple doesn't want. Like that Apple wants to make sure that that
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.560]   whoever's tearing apart and putting it back together isn't going to lead to that. You
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.040]   know, and I think that I don't think it has to do with money. I don't think this is some
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.440]   problem though, Apple and not just Apple, but every phone manufacturer put themselves
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.760]   in by making these sealed batteries and phones. Remember for a long time, we could buy a phone
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.280]   that you pry the back off, put a new battery in. It was an easy thing. It wasn't even repair.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.200]   It was just a swap. I used to always buy extra batteries with my Samsung Galaxy phones because
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.360]   then I wouldn't have to worry about it running out of battery. But if we want that size and
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.280]   we want it to be water resistant, we want all those. Well, water resistance maybe. Okay.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.160]   I mean, like all of those things are we, there's a lot we get by having it. It's also
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.640]   structural. I mean, like the Galaxy phones would squeak. I had a bunch of them. They
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   would just squeak all the time when because the case would.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.800]   But we're paying, I mean, there's a large price for the fact that these phones now are
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.920]   just landfill. So the only thing I wanted to add is that Apple generally, like for these
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.840]   kinds of things, it's not usually about money. It's usually about control. They make so much
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.640]   money off the iPhone and other things that, you know, all the things like MFI and repairs,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.680]   it costs them a fortune to repair MacBook keyboards, for example, like that is a huge
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.600]   loss leader for them. But in general, they want the control over it. And one of the reasons
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.520]   is what Alex said, it's fear of litigation. But the right to repair, I think, is fundamental,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.220]   but also the responsibility of repair. And I was once talking to a very famous prepare
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.240]   person. And I was talking about, you know, they get passcodes from all their, from all
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.440]   the people who bring the phones in. And there have been several incidents of people repairing
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.040]   stuff who take off all the photos and show them to their friends and upload them. And
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   they said, well, it's like going to the doctor's office, you drop your parents if you want
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   the treatment. And I had to point out very politely that doctors go through rigorous
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.960]   training and licensing and they have insurance. And there's all these things we do to protect
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.520]   consumers. And right now, as much as right to repair once regulation, and in part, you
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.960]   have to acknowledge that a lot of these are for-profit repair centers. Like Apple may
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.360]   not make a lot of money. That's a lot of money to the companies that are selling repair,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.080]   especially online repair products and parts. But they, they're going to bring the responsibility
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.640]   that comes with it. And that's going to include privacy protections and protections against
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.600]   fire and any, because these are, these are not inert materials. These are very dangerous
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.360]   materials. They're, I think that they should be licensed to go along with all the rights
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.400]   that I absolutely deserve to have.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.240]   Well said, you've changed my, you've changed my point of view.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   No, I think we agree. It's just the responsibility. It's like Spider-Man.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.760]   Yeah. You know, again, my, my, all, all I will say is that I'm a consumer. I'm not a child.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.360]   I spent money for this laptop. Sometimes I spent $3,000 for this laptop. And this company is
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.920]   saying that I don't have the right to do a board level repair of a component that will
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.600]   cost me $300 or $400 to somebody that I choose to trust as opposed to trying to, but do a
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.400]   $2,000 board level replacement or $3,000 replacement. That is up to me. And if I'm going to take
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   a risk of trust.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   Unfortunate.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   You don't know what you can do.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   I can't, my, my, my, companies that have set fire.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   You know, I either die.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   I don't want to start.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   I don't want to start.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   I don't want to start.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   I don't want to start.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   You can trust it.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   I got to, I do have to point out that.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   We regulate so many things.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   Baby toys and we regulate like the curtains on blinds. We do a lot of things to protect
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.000]   people from themselves. And we have not everything, but a certain degree, like lithium ion batteries
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.560]   need a certain level of regulation. And I think it's just like, it's, it's a responsibility
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560]   that comes prepared.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.000]   I do have to point out this is not like a baby seed.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.680]   I do have to point out this is replacing a screen. This is replacing a battery.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.560]   It is worse than a baby seed.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.840]   I do have to point out that there are laptops.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.040]   Lenovo laptops think pads are quite famous for being very upgradable. You can upgrade.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.200]   You can swap out the keyboard. You can swap out the battery. You can swap out the RAM.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   Lenovo doesn't suffer some sort of huge litigious risk by doing so. And people who want that
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.000]   can buy a Lenovo laptop.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And they should.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.280]   Unfortunately, Apple has a monopoly on iOS and Mac OS. So if you want iOS and Mac OS,
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.080]   you kind of have to do it the Apple way.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.960]   And I think this is a very common.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.600]   Both are safer to swap and repair too.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   We see.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.360]   Lenovo makes them for you to do it.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.880]   Well, but maybe Apple should be doing that.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   Maybe totally.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   Apple's 5% of the market decided not to.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   Apple has decided not to.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.000]   They run their business. You should get a PC.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Right.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   You know, like, like, I mean, I'm just like, it's not, they have a monopoly over.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I'm just pointing out.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   But I'm just saying that consumers have a choice about what they want to do. They're
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.960]   buying into a environment or not.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   But this is the kind of business.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   This is not a surprise.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.680]   This is a regular refrain from people who want to use iOS and Mac OS is Apple way or the highway.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.480]   And doesn't mean we have to sit back and accept it. It's just the way it is.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.360]   But I mean, that's part of what makes iOS and Mac OS delightful to use is that it is Apple's
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   way or the high.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   Well, I don't know if it makes it, honestly, I don't think it makes it delightful.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.200]   Well, it's likely to end up there.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.320]   But it is the way it is.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   But it's the way it is.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:01.840]   Your only choice is to do business with another company. It's why hack and tosses exist, unfortunately.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   And I just, it's just.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.400]   And I think that the right to repair is a 1% issue. Like that's the issue. That's the
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   problem is there's like 1%.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.640]   It is in a way. I'll tell you why it's not. It's about landfill. It's about waste. It's
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.600]   about making a lot of devices like the AirPods that have no future except in a landfill.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   And I really think that.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   So I've heard Apple address that.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   Well, they need to address it more actively. And I think one way to do that is to say,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.280]   OK, you can, you know, we've got to give you a way to make these things repairable.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.080]   Otherwise they're just landfill father. In fact, one senator said, we don't need to
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   have right to repair.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.280]   These are disposables. And that was the wrong attitude.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.520]   That happened in that happened in New Hampshire, as matter of fact. Yeah.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.840]   During a during legislation that was blocked, that was blocking that the actual quotas in
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.360]   the near future cell phones are throwaways. Everyone will just get a new one.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.200]   Yeah. And I think that is that we want to fight because I don't think that that is sustainable
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.440]   in this in this world. I don't think I don't think make it.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   I don't think make it.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.920]   That would that would greatly.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.360]   Sorry. They're arguing is that part of the reason that they fight so strongly for the
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.720]   for their beliefs around repair is that these things aren't responsibly disposed of. And
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.000]   when Apple and Apple licensed people are doing it, part of that licensing process is the
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.360]   way that they are disposed. They're not thrown in the garbage. They're not chucked in land
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.400]   fills. They're brought back and respond and disposed of responsibly.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.640]   You can choose not to believe that, of course, but that's their argument for my arguments
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.240]   that when you look around on the subway and on buses and on the streets and you see people
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.600]   using a phone, any manufacturer with a crack screen, it's not because they dropped it in
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.200]   the screen crack. I thought, you know what? I actually like it that way. That's unique
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.640]   and that's wonderful. There's a reason why they don't have that phone replaced or they
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.800]   don't have it repaired is because they can't afford it. And if there's a way to extend
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.840]   the life of that device to make sure that someone doesn't have to spend another $300
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.440]   to replace a budget phone or doesn't have to extend a contract, another two years and
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.160]   avoid the ability to switch to a different contract. If it will do better for them, I
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.760]   want consumers to have that right. I want any artificial barrier to be removed. It's
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.080]   okay if Apple's a ring of the company is saying, look, this is a MacBook Air. We can't we
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.600]   can't use it put together with Phillips head screws and makes everything, you know, on
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.240]   little trays you can lift and lift out. I get that. But when there are purely artificial,
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.040]   purely dogmatic, purely ideological reasons why you're not allowing someone who at one
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.640]   point laid out money to own something to not have control over that device and not do what
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.520]   they feel as functioning adults is the best thing to do for them to have that device working
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.160]   that is wrong. That is that's just not something that a great company engages in.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   All right.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.480]   When you're going to take a break, stop. Okay.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:49.160]   I'm sorry, but I'm going to put a cloture on this. Why do we always have fight during
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   the holidays? Come on. You're parole decio. I parrogged you. And now the queen has to
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.480]   step in parodies. That's what I'll make. We got lots more to talk about. And, you know,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.280]   this is why I love our panel. You guys are great. You have strong opinions. And I think
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.240]   you argue your opinions very well. That's my biggest problem. I was going, Oh, yeah,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.880]   Andy's right. No, no, Alex is right. No, Andy's right. And so I'm just going to step back
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.120]   and let you all decide yourself. I have to say, there is an argument to be made that
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.280]   the one of the reasons those this new MacBook Pro, for instance, is going to be reliable
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.680]   is because everything's glued down. There's nothing rattling and makes it hard to repair.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.360]   But it is, it is does make, you know, the fact that there's not a M.2 card screwed into
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.760]   the motherboard for the RAM, but it's actually chips surface mounted on the motherboard.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.880]   We talked to our guys all the time about how they set equipment down because it's constantly,
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.600]   like we always talk about soft hands. We put it down and you just don't want to hear it
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.280]   bang. Right. Because people will just set things down and it works that time, but you
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.400]   do that a thousand times. It's going to shake it up. Yeah. Laptops don't last that long
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.440]   as a result. Our show today brought to you by another. I think this is an invasion that
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.560]   everybody can get behind. Epson's eco tank printers. How often are you in the middle
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.240]   of a print job and the ink cartridge runs out and you got to go to the store and get
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.600]   more ink cartridges. I always have like extra ink cartridges lying around, but that's also
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.960]   not very economical. Eco tank just solves this and I really commend Epson because frankly,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.840]   this was a risky thing for them to do. They said, all right, here's what we're going to
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.600]   do. We're going to put tanks, not cartridges. A lot of companies say sell their printers
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.080]   at a loss because they know they're going to make the money back on the cartridges very
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   quickly. You can buy a $50 printer with cartridges. It costs more. You'd be cheaper to throw the
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.200]   printer out every time than the buy new cartridges, not Epson. Epson says, look, we want these
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.480]   printers to last a long time. We're going to build in a tank, actually tanks for each
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:49.160]   color, nice, giant, super sized, easy to fill tanks. When you buy the printer, it's going
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:55.240]   to come with two years of ink in the box. When it comes time to buy new ink, thousands
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   of pages later, you're going to get up to another two years of ink. It just means fewer
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.400]   trips to the office supply store. It's not going to run out as fast. It's just a great
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.800]   way to do it. Every eco tank printer is super sized, easy to fill tanks. You can't fill them
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.200]   wrong. The bottles are key to go in. You can't fill them wrong. There are no drip, no spill
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.080]   bottles. I know this because I have two eco tanks and I've filled them both. I have to
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   say I haven't filled them since. It's been more than a year on both of them. This is
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.280]   really a revolution. It's changing the way people print. I have to think it's driving
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:31.240]   the other printer company's crazy. Less frustration. Because it's the holiday season, I think you
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.400]   should get one for your friends and family too. Why not buy an eco tank for mom and dad?
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.560]   Why should they have that frustration? You'll have more time to treat yourself. Print all
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.960]   those wish lists, letters to Santa. Holiday cards in gorgeous color. Yes, they're color.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.640]   I think the Epson eco tank is a perfect holiday gift. Add it to your shopping list. You too,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.760]   and your family and friends can fill and chill. Check out eco tank printers at Best Buy Staples,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:06.520]   Walmart, Target, Epson.com/ecotankleo. Transform the way your home or office prints. It's great
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.280]   for an office too, I should point out. They have office, they're all in one so they have
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:17.320]   office style, they have home style. Epson, E-P-S-O-N.com/ecotankleo. Do away with that
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:24.880]   of ink frustration. Epson eco tank printers. Just fill and chill. Epson, exceed your vision.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.160]   Epson deserves a pat on the back. When a company does something like this, that's good for
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.440]   consumers. I think they should be. We slam companies at plenty. This is a good thing.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:43.080]   And speaking of landfill, no more cartridges in the landfill, right? Epson.com/ecotankleo
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:50.520]   for more information. Thank you, Epson. Okay, here's another thing to get mad at Apple about.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   Actually, I understand this one. I actually sympathize. They have pulled all their customer
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   reviews from the online store. As of November 17th, the ratings and review section from
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:11.720]   all product pages on the Apple website are gone. Here's why I'm sympathetic.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.240]   Is this real? I don't want to get outraged and come back with a new review module. Wouldn't
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.080]   that be funny? Okay. Because it's the internet. You're right. Okay. And also, I think it's
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.280]   from the website, not from the app. Are they in the app? Go check them out. I still see.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   Maybe it's just a web redo. I think it's... Oh, you know what? Maybe they set the foreground
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.240]   to the background color of the star. I think it's a simple as, hey, we don't want to manage
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.800]   the connection. Well, I'll tell you what, you used to have... I don't know. You probably
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   remember this. In the earliest days of the show, we put it up on a... It was a Drupal
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.960]   site and there were comments on it. But I stopped that because half the time it's some
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.560]   disgruntled fan saying, "Well, he never does." And I just didn't want people coming to the
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.720]   sites to download a show and then see all the negative reviews. And links. So I just
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.000]   didn't want to... So it does look like they're still in the app. They're still in the app.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.680]   In the app itself. I mean, the web... I guess when I was saying the web page is generally
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.160]   the link to the app. Like, you know, I don't say anything.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.880]   Well, most people don't have the app, especially people don't have the app.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.000]   Also, if you click through the questions, you get taken to what I think is a web object
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.920]   here, a terabad CMS.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.440]   Well, that's part of the problem is there... Yeah, they're moving away from that, I think.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.240]   I heard that they're stopping. They're not going to use web objects.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   Yeah. And so...
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.760]   But it does look like all the reviews are still in the app.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   Okay. So they're not getting rid of the reviews.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.880]   I'll get angry if they're gone. I just want to make sure it's worth getting angry.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   Yeah. Like I said, I'm not that angry.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.720]   I mean, I think they need to be there. And I think it would be silly for them not to be there.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.680]   I get the... We don't want negative reviews, but it's not just Apple products that are for sale at Apple.com.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.520]   Well, that was part of my de-products.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:48.920]   Well, that was part of my de-products.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.960]   But when he goes there to buy, especially stuff that's exclusive to Apple.com, but it's not made by Apple,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.080]   that's when you really do want those reviews, right?
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.240]   Well, it doesn't Apple want customers to buy from them and like these...
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.800]   Especially these third-party things from them instead of, say, Amazon and Amazon.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.120]   And build their whole business on having reviews.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.080]   Good point.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.720]   What I will say is that...
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.840]   I think they're coming back.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.320]   Okay.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.520]   My guess is that if Apple takes them down and keeps them down, it's that...
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.120]   We spend a lot of time picking this up.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.680]   We think it's good. It's in the stores.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.840]   It's good. There's 20 of the same...
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.320]   Exactly.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.600]   You need to do an Amazon.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.920]   You know, an Amazon, you're trying to figure out which one is which.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   And I always go to Amazon and I look for the worst reviews to see what broke.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   And do I think that this is going to be a problem when it breaks for me.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.120]   Right.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.400]   All the other...
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.520]   Yeah, I can say there's smart enough to parse reviews and be like,
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.400]   "Okay, wait a minute.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:47.320]   This is one guy complaining because he's the one person that got the damaged shipping box
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.080]   that wasn't even the shippers' fault.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.880]   It was, you know, that extra roll over it.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.440]   So, yeah.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.400]   It also be nice if Apple decided to open up access to reviews.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.840]   Amazon reviews are a huge problem because they are so ripe for abuse.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.120]   And so the ability to have an outside service,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.600]   take a...
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.280]   Basically scrape those reviews and say,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.200]   "Yeah, it turns out that most of these reviews are fake from accounts that we've been seeing
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.440]   popping up in all across Amazon everywhere."
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.240]   So you can sort of validate what the value of that four and a half or five-star review is.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.640]   I mean, if I were writing the code for that,
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.200]   I would...
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.240]   The ones that would get bubbled up to the top would probably be the three and a half and four-star reviews.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.320]   Because to my mind, that means that that's a mixture of five-star reviews
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.720]   from legitimate people who didn't really think that hard about it.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.240]   And they reviewed it immediately.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.800]   Three-star reviews to people who've been using it for two or three months.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.720]   I want to see the curve.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.040]   I want to see the statistical curve of how many reviews were put into each category
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.240]   before I decide whether I would rather go with a three and a half or four-star product than a five-star product.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.320]   I always like the long reviews, you know, in Amazon, where someone really breaks down.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.600]   They're like, "I write a couple reviews."
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.720]   And mine are always these long pages of like, "This is what I found.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.600]   This is how this is. They should fix this and they didn't work it."
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.560]   And I never give any five.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.920]   But see, if I saw your name on a review, I'm going to read that and read it hard and trust it, right?
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.280]   I've been thinking about time-lapsing when I have to put things together.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.360]   Like, and then put it up as the video.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.840]   Like, here's what it actually took to build that chair.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   Because it's...
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.640]   You know, as I...
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.080]   The one time I got into it with somebody who reviewed one of my books,
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.160]   it's... he didn't understand what the book was about.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.240]   And so he thought it was going to be about X.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.360]   It was clearly about Y.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.000]   That's what they...
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.880]   It was described as.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.080]   You gave it a one-star review.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.280]   And which was of course the thing that kills you,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.680]   because it's like, this has nothing but like four and a half.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.600]   This one single one-star review is totally harthing my mellow.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.720]   And I had to explain to this person that this book is 287 pages long.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.520]   Now, you're telling me that if you got this book that purports to be about special tricks,
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.320]   you can do it to get content on your iPod or iPhone.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.840]   And instead, Ted, every page had simply the text,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.360]   "Hey, Ted, you're such a loser.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.040]   I have your money now. Ha ha ha."
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.240]   On 273.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   It would still be a one-star review.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   You're telling me that there is no way you could have been more disappointed with this.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.040]   So yeah, it's...
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.000]   Star reviews need curating.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.560]   You know, the...
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.440]   I'll give you an example.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.080]   I was about to buy this five-pound bag of sugar-free gummy bears.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.560]   Why?
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.040]   Because I'm a keto diet.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.400]   And I love gummy bears.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.840]   And then I read this review.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.360]   Because you're having some funny work about it.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.520]   You know you're going to be without your bathroom for a few days.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.720]   That's delicious.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.160]   But sweet mother of God, the absolute agony I was in after consuming a handful
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:46.120]   of these little balls of concentrated evil can only be described as being in anal labor for 20 hours.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.320]   But still three stars?
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.960]   On the plus side.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.480]   I lost about eight pounds of water weight.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.560]   So...
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.600]   Sure, it wasn't gummy weight.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.480]   I'm glad I didn't buy.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.360]   That five-pound bag of sugar-free...
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.800]   Well, but they gave you advice, right?
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.360]   Tasty, but only you've consumed in the right interval.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:02.760]   So...
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.320]   Yes, about two bears every six hours of anal labor.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.360]   Yeah, this is a...
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.560]   I'm afraid that...
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.760]   I'm afraid that...
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.880]   People who have bought this bag have often bought the book Everybody Poops,
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.840]   a one of the same curves.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.160]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.040]   So that's why...
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.160]   That's why reviews...
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.520]   Now that you could be lifesaving.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.760]   You know, the ninja thing with reviews is that if something goes wrong with your device,
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.800]   you think that you should go up and complain about it.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.680]   But someone sent me something, it was like a chair or whatever.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.720]   It was missing a hole.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.920]   Like the screw couldn't go through because it was a hole.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.440]   So I sent them an email.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.640]   That's a fair way to...
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:35.960]   Yes.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.240]   No, but I sent them an email and I just said,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.680]   "Hey, it didn't come with all the pieces cut out."
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.960]   And I said, "I haven't reviewed this yet.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.920]   Can I get enough?"
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.120]   Oh...
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.360]   And they were like, "Sure, we'll send that right out."
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.120]   Yeah, John wants to show another five-pound gummy bear review.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.080]   If you had...
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.440]   Whoa, wait a minute.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   One gummy bear...
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.400]   Five pounds.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.080]   Thanksgiving size.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.120]   Take a bite out of that.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.240]   Well, save you a lot of time.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.760]   Give that a gummy bear a gummy chair.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.600]   Wow.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.840]   20-pound turkey stuffed with that one gummy bear.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.240]   Oh, good.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.320]   It's like a disclaimer there.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.640]   That's the color of your poo.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.680]   Otherwise, excellent.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.600]   Why is this how food reviews on Amazon go?
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.880]   Do we know exactly how it's connected to...
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.920]   No, you're right.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.480]   This is not.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.720]   Sorry, we've gone on a series...
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.760]   And all the very bad gummy bears have found gummy bears at the end of it.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.280]   Well, like, gummy bears aren't at the end.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.080]   That's the problem.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:35.800]   Is it...
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.280]   Every one of those reviews takes it to the next step.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.080]   I'm the gummy bear.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.640]   Just remember, gummy bears are not even getting into horseshoebs.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.200]   Are they?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.440]   Joe, put the bunny back in the box.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.280]   There are no vegan gummy bears.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.920]   I want a sugar-free vegan gummy bear.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.880]   Horseshoebs.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.200]   Okay.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.560]   Let's get some positive stuff.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.200]   Positive.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.480]   Apple's launching.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.760]   I think this is a good move.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.680]   Apple Music for business.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.840]   It's crazy.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.440]   It's not making sense.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.840]   I was like, clear, not for business time.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.440]   For businesses.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.520]   This is actually a big business.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.080]   For retail.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.760]   Not for getting down to business.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.080]   This is actually a big business to get into.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.720]   Oh, it's huge.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.000]   It's an odd thing to get into.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.400]   Like, it's odd for a consumer company to get into it.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.360]   But the issue is that you can't just hook your--
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.040]   legally, you can't just plug your iPod in or iPhone or whatever,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040]   or Bluetooth and play it at a store
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.800]   because that's a public performance.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.640]   And it needs to be Ascap, BMI.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.800]   There's royalties at the page.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.280]   There's even a--
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.840]   There's even--
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.560]   Like, this has to be the worst job that being a meter made.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.960]   There's even guys who walk around into stores--
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.400]   --and say, excuse me, but is that licensed?
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.520]   And when I had a--
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.920]   When I worked at a restaurant, we had an eight-track tape.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.160]   This is in the 90s.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.680]   We had an eight-track tape because it would always just keep repeating.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.280]   And you just pop different ones in.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.720]   But those were all registered.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.680]   And they were--
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.600]   And so it was licensed by--
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.880]   And it's usually not a lot of money.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.560]   But the problem is it's managing it.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.440]   This is a--
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.360]   By moving-- Spotify's doing the same thing.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.320]   Are they doing this too?
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.640]   Yes.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.280]   And by moving to this, it's actually good for the artists
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.920]   because the artists are going to get the royalties for stuff.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.280]   Instead of it being general, like, well, I think they kind of played whatever from the thing.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.560]   They're now--
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.960]   You'll know what played at Macy's or what played at--
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.480]   Pandora's done this for a while.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.160]   But I still go into the nail salon or the hairdressers.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.280]   And they just put Pandora on the speakers and they just play it.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.640]   But he has to make it easy.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.040]   You know, as you make it easier to be legal, it makes it--
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.160]   And there's a huge opportunity for the artists to get more money.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.240]   There's a huge opportunity for everybody to do.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.040]   Oh, yeah. It's the right thing.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.200]   And you may well get a letter.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.760]   I know business have gotten letters from Ask at BMI saying, well, now you owe us $3,000.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.480]   And it's going to be like for like a nail salon is probably $10 or $20 a month.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:47.960]   You know?
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.160]   It's for businesses, $27.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.960]   Yeah, it's all dependent on audience size, right?
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.400]   Like how many people are there that you are playing this public performance of this song for?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.680]   I've played in cover bands, you know, I'm a drummer.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.040]   And I've been in bars when like a rep from Ask App comes in and says,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.680]   OK, let me see your-- not to the band because the band don't have any money.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.720]   They go to the bar owner and say, you're supposed to be licensed.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.960]   If they're not, I've seen bars get shut down over this.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:26.040]   Yeah, again, it's all dependent on audience size and how frequently you're playing these songs.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.120]   But I think it makes a lot of sense for Apple to get into this.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.000]   I know some folks say, what a weird business for Apple to be in.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.440]   But they've already got all the relationships in place.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.880]   They've already got all the songs.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.560]   All they need to do is turn this other revenue stream on.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:45.080]   But you were saying Alex, I mean, this is super helpful for businesses that want this stuff
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:50.760]   because they don't have to live in fear of who's that next person that just walked in the door
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:58.520]   and are they going to bust us and give them a headache that is totally unrelated to the business
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.240]   that they're actually doing, like selling groceries or, you know, doing your hair or whatever it is.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.800]   It's just--
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.400]   It'll actually give them a lot more freedom.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.040]   --and be done.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.480]   Because they wanted to be legal a lot of times they're using very limited playlists,
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.360]   and all kinds of other stuff because that's all they can do.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.400]   So this is a--
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.160]   Well, Apple's curating these playlists for people too, right?
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.360]   As I understand it, so you get something that's tailored for the type of people you expect
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.800]   to be coming into your establishment too.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.600]   It'll be interesting to see if they do what Vegas does.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.880]   A lot of the Vegas hotels don't want to pay that thing.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.360]   And so there is whole studios that make covers of the songs to get around some of the rights.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.240]   Yeah, you can cut out half the rights if you do that.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.760]   Cut out half the rights by--
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.640]   And so they'll make the song close to it, but not quite.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.520]   And so there-- but there's all these--
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.840]   And if you look at Spotify, like when there's like covers of--
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.480]   This is what--
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.280]   --and all the other stuff.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.240]   Never search for Beatles on Spotify because half the time you're going to get a fake--
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.080]   You're giving me a fake song.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.360]   So I didn't know this, but they've got this as an app.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.840]   By the way, it's brought to you by somebody called the Play Network.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.280]   So Apple's not even--
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.640]   I guess the licensing is being handled by a third party.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.800]   But it's an app you have to sign up for it.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.840]   You get an 8-digit code and you can put it in your app on the iPhone and the iPad
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.040]   and then just play from--
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   So it's really just as easy.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.760]   This is where it really works because Apple makes the hardware too.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.080]   You don't have to buy a special box or anything.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.360]   It's just as easy to use it as it would be to use Apple Music.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.080]   And the reviews are in.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.520]   Five out of five stars.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.040]   Oh, and here's some good news.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.240]   You can also family share your Apple music for business.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   Between four stars all by siblings.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:35.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:40.040]   But you can family share the app, not necessarily the service, right?
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.320]   Yeah, I don't know how that works.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.400]   You know, they should really--
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.520]   Apple's getting away with something here because they should have the in-app purchase price.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.480]   I was hoping they would so I could see how much it would be, but it's not on it.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.120]   Yeah, you have to sign up and have a conversation with somebody to get--
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.200]   We need to have a conversation.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.160]   Custom pricing.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.760]   And you got to buy a bundled home pod.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.640]   That's what we're going to tell you.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:46:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.400]   Let's see here.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:09.640]   Apple and Intel are suing a soft bank-owned firm.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.320]   Softbank's in a lot of Dutch these days after the WeWork debacle.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.800]   They were a big investor in WeWork.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.280]   Apparently Softbank owns a fortress investment group.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:28.040]   And Apple and Intel jointly filed a lawsuit last week accusing FIG of violating US
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.000]   federal antitrust laws by pursuing "endless, meritless patent litigation."
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.960]   Or as they say in the non-libelous language, a patent assertion entity.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.760]   Kidspell assertion without--
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:56.520]   And Apple and Intel argue that fortress-backed entities, that's the other thing,
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.240]   a lot of these patent assertion entities do is they create lots of smaller entities,
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.280]   all with headquarters in East Texas.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:09.880]   They've sought billions of dollars from the two companies, billions, billions with a
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.280]   B of dollars from the two companies over the years, forcing both tech giants to spend
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.880]   millions of dollars on outside resources like Council and expert witnesses to defend.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:28.520]   Among the other entities, fortress backs are Unilok, DSS technology management, and seven networks
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.880]   also named in the lawsuit.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:36.600]   I had a menu of administrative change in the courts would fix almost all of them.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.360]   I thought we passed a law.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.040]   Did we not in Congress that made it harder to be a patent rule?
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.600]   Well, I just think that if you made it easier to move the venue, that would do it.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:53.880]   If they made it almost automatic, if a venue rules more than 5% one way or the other,
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.720]   then you automatically can move the venue.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.600]   If you were able to do that, then East Texas wouldn't matter.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.960]   And then all these patent things, because once on their face, they would lose,
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:09.400]   they go to East Texas because that's a business there to mess it up.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.560]   That and I think that I really feel like if you file for a patent, there should be a certain
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.040]   number of years before you have to bring it to market.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.600]   And if you don't bring it to market, you can enforce it.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.400]   Like it's just maybe you don't lose it, but you can enforce it.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.520]   Like the first seven years of your patent, you have that time to actually get it off the ground.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.680]   And if you're not going to get it off the ground, then other people can do it.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.960]   Because right now we're in this kind of crazy hole.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.560]   That's a tough thing though, right?
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:40.600]   I mean, because what if you're bad at running a business, but good at creating these things that
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.400]   are actually, I mean, listen, I'm the first person.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:50.040]   The intention of a patent was to protect you to make the product, not to think of the product,
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.000]   but to make it.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.600]   We've twisted this whole process over the last couple hundred years
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.520]   into this idea that I can just think something up.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.960]   It used to be you had to build like a little version of it and send it to the patent office.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.720]   And then you don't have to do that anymore.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.280]   It was not designed to do what it's doing now.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.960]   And the bottom line is, I mean, it'll only last for a certain amount of time.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   You look at like, I mean, if you go back and look at TikTok and you look at the share culture
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.840]   that's going on there, those kids are not going to understand this.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.360]   And eventually they're going to be congressmen.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.040]   And they're going to be like, yeah, we don't get this at all.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.840]   We're not going to do that.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.680]   I mean, they're entire that you have all the content is based on somebody else's work.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.200]   They're not going to the next generation is not going to get this at all.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.320]   No, this you're right.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.200]   This will go away.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.640]   No, I'm with you.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.040]   I've always said, if you want an idea to be worth $100, write it on a $100 bill.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.280]   That's like ideas aren't worth anything without execution.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.200]   But some execution takes time.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:46.600]   I guess if you can show that you are working towards that and making some sort of progress,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.160]   you should be able to protect the intellectual property that you've created during that progress.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:57.000]   And where I have an issue is putting a time limit on it, maybe a time limit with no progress,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.200]   sure, but otherwise.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.480]   But bring something to market.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.240]   You know, like that's related to that.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.720]   Yes.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.920]   You shouldn't take seven years.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.640]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.200]   Sure.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.480]   Fair.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.040]   Maybe seven years is the right time or maybe you can file for an extension
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.640]   and there's a consideration.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.080]   But you can't automatically just keep re-upping it.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.320]   Right.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:15.880]   Right.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.720]   When we come back, I want to talk about Apple TV now that we've had it for a while.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.880]   And there's a big debut coming up.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.120]   Thanksgiving day.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.160]   And one knot coming up.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.960]   And one knot coming up.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.680]   Stay tuned.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.520]   Well, that's a good tease.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:32.920]   Thank you.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:38.120]   As I've been told many times, teases don't work in podcasts.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.000]   People just skip the ad and go right to the meat.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.880]   Don't skip this one.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.840]   You're going to be sorry.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.880]   Are you sure they've--
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.360]   Unsquippable.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.800]   Unsquippable.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.440]   Are you sure they brought to you by World Wide Technology?
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.960]   If you are a buyer of enterprise technology,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.040]   you need to affect you.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.440]   I'm sure you know about WWT already.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.880]   But if you don't, you need to know about it.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.160]   And most importantly about their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center,
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.760]   they started building this 10 years ago.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.480]   And it has grown like top seed.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.880]   There's no other testing and research lab in the world
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.000]   like the ATC.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.400]   Partly because of WWT and their partnerships with so many great companies,
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.280]   they have been able to put in half a billion dollars in equipment into the ATC.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:27.080]   From hundreds of OEMs and key partners, high tech heavyweights like Yes Intel,
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:33.880]   but Dell EMC, HP Enterprise, Cisco, the little guys too, Equinix.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.640]   Lots of companies are in there.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.280]   And the reason you want them all in there, because this is what the engineers at WWT
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.680]   use to spin up proofs of concepts, to learn about the devices,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.640]   to create pilot programs for you, their customers.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.280]   But here's what's so cool about this.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.800]   Yeah, you get all the benefits of WWT using it.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.320]   But you can use it too.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.080]   There are-- yes, there are hundreds of on-demand
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.320]   and schedulable labs representing the newest advances in--
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.360]   Well, anything you might be interested in, there's Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.960]   Whoa.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.600]   Multi-cloud architecture.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.440]   A lot of people are doing multi-home clouds, multi-home clouds now,
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.400]   and that's a big deal.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.800]   But you got to try it before you buy it, right?
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:26.760]   Artificial intelligence, IoT solutions built on Intel platforms,
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.720]   like the world's only--
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.880]   this is amazing, the world's only Intel FPGA Acceleration Lab.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.360]   And the thing about these labs is, yes, the engineers at WWT use it,
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.160]   but you can too.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.360]   I'll tell you how in a second.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.320]   Intel selects solutions labs for technologies like VMware V-SAN,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.120]   other cutting-edge solutions based on Intel's second-generation Xeon scalable processors,
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.160]   Intel's new tier of Optane Data Center Persistent Memory.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.040]   It's all in there.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.200]   So here's how you go.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.520]   Here's how you learn about products before you launch.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.640]   How you can see how new products will interact with your existing solutions.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.720]   And you can do it yourself because they offer the Lab, the Advanced Technology Center,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.880]   Lab as a service, they call it.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:15.560]   It's a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you can perform your own programmatic testing
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.360]   using all of this vast technology, this whole ecosystem that WWT's put together.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.760]   And because it's virtual, you don't have to be in St. Louis.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.920]   You can do it anywhere in the world anytime, day or night, 24/7.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.680]   You'll be working side by side with those great WWT engineers who are working in labs
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.480]   beta testing new edge to cloud solutions based on the latest and greatest Intel technologies,
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:43.000]   building reference architectures and custom integrations to help you make better decisions
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.920]   to see results faster, to reduce the cost of using state of the art gear.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.120]   WWT has launched this new digital platform.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.080]   They launched it this summer.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.200]   It encompasses the entire ATC ecosystem.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.240]   And I think the benefits you get, and it's not just the labs as a service,
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.720]   articles, case studies, you get the hands-on labs, you get all the tools you need to make
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.880]   a huge difference to really help you do the right job in today's fast-paced world.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.120]   Learn more about the WWT ATC and to sign up for access on the new on-demand lab platform,
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:23.160]   go to www.wt.com/twit, create the account, get started.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.400]   WWT Worldwide Technology simplifies the complex.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.240]   Twit, please use that address.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.360]   Let them know you saw it here.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.600]   I think you'll be glad to.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   WWT delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.080]   And you know what?
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.400]   They're really nice too.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.200]   They're great people.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.000]   We've actually, I don't know if I'm saying anything out of school, but we're
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.840]   planning a couple of live events with WWT.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.960]   We're very excited.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.240]   I don't know if we're going to be doing them in St. Louis, where I think we'll probably do
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.520]   at least one in St. Louis.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   But what we've been doing with partners, we did this with LastPass last year and was so
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.080]   successful.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.680]   We want to do this more this year.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.040]   It's a chance for us to bring the shows out into the world.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.000]   We did one in Austin at South By last year.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.040]   We did one with LastPass in Boston.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   So at least with WWT and some other sponsors, then LastPass, we've got two more set up.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.640]   We're going to start getting out into the world and see people.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.200]   That's crazy.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.080]   You should help us.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:21.880]   I'd be happy to.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.240]   You could really help us with the AV.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.560]   Yeah, I can make it look good.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.360]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.720]   He is Mr. Pixelcore.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.200]   He's also online at the Twitter @AlexLindsay, S-A-Y.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.960]   That way you can find out what he's up to.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.920]   You're always doing something.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.480]   And the Twitter is the way to follow you.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.400]   But you're taking some time off for the holidays.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:41.960]   I like that.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.040]   Off of Twitter?
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.920]   No, off of us.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.000]   I mean, off of the outside world, so you can be with us.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:47.480]   Yes.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.520]   You're going to be here for a while.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.240]   Yeah, no, I'm fine.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:49.800]   Like a week.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.240]   No, I'm going to--
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.000]   When do you go back on the road?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.440]   Right now, February.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.560]   OK, so maybe we can expect you on the show from the next few months.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:57.960]   That's great.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.520]   Absolutely.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.480]   Bringing your son in.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.960]   Who is-- I just learned 12.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.080]   I remember when you were born.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.200]   You were doing Mac break weekly when he was born.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.840]   I think I have a picture of him sitting on your lap in the mixer.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:09.720]   That's fine.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.440]   That's fine.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.600]   Alex, could you pinch his cheek for me?
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.520]   He's grown up so much.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.240]   There we go.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.040]   Everybody needs to.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.080]   He's not a little boy.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.120]   He's a little man.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:18.680]   Look at him.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.160]   Look at him.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:19.640]   Look at him.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.160]   Look at him.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.120]   He's so cute.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.400]   And look at his shirt.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.120]   He's got a new element in the table of--
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.400]   Periodic table of elements.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.920]   It's um, the element of confusion.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.720]   I'm very familiar with this element.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.800]   Thanks for coming.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:38.680]   Happy birthday.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.960]   All right.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.520]   Now, sit down.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:40.920]   Birthday.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:46.600]   His birthday was a couple of days ago, right?
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.960]   It was Sunday.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.840]   12th birthday.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.720]   12th birthday we had.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.840]   Isn't that huge?
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.480]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.040]   Isn't that huge?
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.480]   We're still cleaning up the gallium.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.520]   Did you see Apple's Christmas commercial?
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:01.560]   I hated it at first, but they won me over at the end.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.920]   It made me cry.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.320]   Oh, no.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:03.720]   It's not more.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.480]   I didn't like them babysitting with devices.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.480]   That part really felt bad to me at the beginning of the day.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:07.800]   You know what?
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.520]   That's funny.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.960]   I thought the same thing.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.760]   I still cried.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.440]   Give me two.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.080]   I'm thinking that's terrible.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.120]   Well, the kids flipped it on.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.720]   And the kids were like, we're not going to just play video game.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.760]   Can I play this without getting us pulled down?
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.720]   Only one way to find out.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.800]   It's your bad.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:32.280]   Apple, if you're listening, I want to play your commercial.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.880]   They're charging you millions of dollars to play it on Monday night football.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:43.160]   I want to play it for free on this vast broadcast network that reaches
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.000]   Apple enthusiasts all over the world.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.880]   Surely you wouldn't pull us down.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.760]   It's an everything else.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.000]   And we always say such nice things about you always.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.760]   Oh, look, they're not even letting me play it.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.720]   It's they know Leo.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.640]   They know they've blocked it.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.880]   Anyway, it's actually an interesting ad.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.760]   And I wonder if Apple knew that people would get pissed off.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.120]   I think they did, Renee.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.920]   I think they did too.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.640]   I think the whole oh, Henry twist of it.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.400]   Is that you feel like a screw at the beginning and then you go,
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.800]   Oh, that's what they were doing.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:23.640]   Oh, well, it's clear that the family is not just dysfunctional because of the loss.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.160]   They're unable to function and they're using everything as a coping mechanism.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.840]   And then the twist is that the kids instead of just zoning out and playing video games
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.760]   are the only ones who are capable of bringing the family back together.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   Right.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.320]   Through the miracles of an iPad.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:43.240]   But they're not old enough to understand it's by repressing their emotions and suppressing
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.680]   conversations is why we have peaceful holidays in this whole young man.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.600]   Good point, Andy.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.400]   Just an alcohol, but not too much.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.440]   At least we're sitting.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.640]   We're watching the football game.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.200]   We're sitting.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:54.920]   I'm watching it.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:58.680]   And of course, at the very end, there is a moment where you just go.
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:58.840]   Yes.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.200]   And Lisa, are you crying?
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.880]   I said, you're crying.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.600]   You're crying.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:12.360]   Anyway, again, Apple's really good with the ads.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.560]   Is it the same?
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.440]   Do you know the--
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.320]   I shared it on--
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.720]   I think it's Apple now.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.680]   Are they doing it in the house?
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.200]   They do a lot of it in the house.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.000]   I don't know for sure.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.040]   They have their own agency now.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:22.760]   They have their own internal agency.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.560]   Internal agency.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.520]   I shared it on Twitter and a guy wrote back saying,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.080]   "I'm a recent widower and it's raining on my face."
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.360]   And just lost it at that point.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.520]   It is the same thing that happens in up.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.280]   It's the backstory.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.960]   It's the backstory of up, which also--
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.440]   The first five minutes.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.840]   The first five minutes of up or 10 minutes make me without--
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.880]   Ball my eyes out.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.400]   Yeah, without any dialogue.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   No worries.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:43.800]   Dye-log.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.440]   That's crazy.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.120]   All right, let's talk about Apple TV,
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.840]   because that's the good.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.960]   Now the bad.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:56.200]   Actually, I want to amend my review of the morning show,
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.120]   because the first couple of episodes I thought,
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.240]   oh, this is--
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.600]   you could see all the money,
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.440]   if that's the goal,
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.000]   but I'm not grabbed by it.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.600]   But by the fifth or sixth episode,
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.040]   it's too bad,
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.480]   but it took about five episodes.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.200]   And then I'm starting--
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.400]   Fine, Phil, the season.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.040]   Yeah, true.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.600]   I think the morning show is--
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.960]   it's not great, but it's pretty good.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.200]   It's 63% on "Wotten Tomatoes,"
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.360]   which actually annoys the showrunners,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.080]   Mimi Letter and the Carrie Aaron said at "Recode Decode."
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.400]   When those bad reviews came in,
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.080]   I didn't know what show they were watching.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.400]   I just thought they were nuts,
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.520]   said Mimi Letter.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.480]   I just felt there were a lot--
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.600]   and this is an interesting point.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.800]   A lot of Apple haters--
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.360]   she thought they were reviewing Apple.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.640]   They want Apple to fail.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.200]   Tell them the case.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.040]   That's always a good look,
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.480]   getting really, really hostile
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.920]   and defensive to bad reviews.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.520]   I'm always on the side of the creator
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.720]   whenever I see that response.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.440]   Right.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.480]   We're focused on this.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Well, we're--
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.920]   I mean, it's like she hasn't made a--
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.320]   hasn't read a review before.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.520]   That just seems--
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.960]   I mean, of course, there's going to be bad reviews.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.640]   There's going to be more bad than good.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.600]   So take it.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.960]   Just wait for the Snyder Cut.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.040]   And I want to say that even though I didn't pan it,
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.960]   I just said it's not great.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.360]   There's a lot of beauty shots of Apple products in it.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.560]   It's overly--
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.640]   for one thing, there's a lot of dark shots.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.520]   And I think they're trying to show off the HDR features
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.560]   of the Apple TV.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.440]   The B-aid is amazing.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.200]   Both on Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.720]   The B-aid is amazing.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.840]   It makes them look like lazy.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.920]   Yeah, I feel like in some degree,
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.760]   the production elements are designed
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.640]   to show off Apple gear more than they are to further the story.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.920]   But it's not bad.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.760]   It's the detail on those sweaters.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.440]   And that's seen by the fireplace.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.560]   Sweaters are great.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.160]   Is that deep fusion on TV?
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.080]   Now, on Thursday, I am very excited.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.600]   But this is based only on the trailers,
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.040]   the M Night Channel and the series start serving.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:52.760]   Just got news.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.160]   They've already renewed it for a second season
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.360]   before it even debuted.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.240]   This is what Apple's been doing,
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.120]   which is first three episodes will come out on Thanksgiving,
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.080]   ruining Thanksgiving for all of us.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.800]   And then everyone's going to watch that on Thanksgiving.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.920]   I'm watching football.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.440]   But I'm excited about this.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.640]   I like Shyamalan.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   He's controversial, controversial.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.000]   There are a lot of people who don't like his stuff.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.400]   But I think he's paying his pen.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.520]   I like the book stuff.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.080]   He had a lot of answer for after the village, particularly.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.280]   I like the village.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.400]   I like the village.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:25.960]   I like the village.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.880]   The happening is what they lost me in happening.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.720]   You thought we'd gotten to a fight about Apple
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.080]   and then write a repair?
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.560]   No, guys, that's the coolest thing.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.520]   It's good.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.360]   See, this is exactly what Shyamalan does.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.800]   There's nobody like Airbender, right?
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.680]   Nobody like Airbender?
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.080]   No, no.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.960]   I do not like these.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.520]   They've been up in great.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.280]   His first, you know, I mean, I see dead people.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.480]   That was a great movie, right?
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.400]   I love Unbreakable.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.120]   Unbreakable.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.760]   I thought it was good.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.640]   They're amazing.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.280]   As long as Bruce Willis is in a Shyamalan movie, it's good.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.720]   I didn't like the last one.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.360]   I thought the last one ended real bad.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.560]   The glass.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.600]   So do we want to say anything about Servant?
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.360]   It's just spooky as hell looking at it.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.240]   Apparently they--
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.680]   It's already been renewed.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.880]   Just because you're wondering, yes, it does happen in Philadelphia.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.440]   OK.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.240]   And my chamalades.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.880]   He's like all of his are all like a filled--
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.000]   He must be from there, right?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.040]   Kind of like, yeah.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   I don't think it's--
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.680]   if you've seen the trailers, you'll know it's about a family
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.760]   in mourning and they hire a young nanny to take care of their kid.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.840]   They give the kid a baby doll and then mayhem ensues.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.400]   There you go.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.320]   So what was-- what Alex, you said the--
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.360]   The banker.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.240]   The banker.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.760]   The banker was suddenly pooled.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.320]   What's the banker?
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.960]   We don't know what.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.560]   I didn't even remember the banker.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.080]   The banker is based on a real--
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:43.720]   it is a--
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.400]   based on a true story of two--
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.240]   I believe it was African-American--
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.280]   or African-Americans who fronted a bank to provide a wider spread of loans.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:54.920]   And they hired a--
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.960]   they brought in a white guy to front it.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.720]   And this is in the '50s.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.240]   And--
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.520]   It's got Samuel L. Jackson in it.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:03.800]   I mean, it's--
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.160]   How can anything with Samuel L. Jackson and it not make money?
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.440]   There were charges of historical inaccuracy and also of some sexual misconduct by the
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.480]   someone on the production team.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.440]   Oh, man.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.120]   Can you imagine how much money is shot?
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.880]   I mean, look at this.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.320]   It looks-- I'm just looking at the trailer.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.840]   Well, it's not-- it actually isn't that big of a--
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   I mean, it's a well-shot movie, but it's not--
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.520]   Apple didn't produce this one.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.120]   This one was bought, I believe it.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.920]   So now it was going to have a theatrical release.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.760]   Is it not even going to have the theatrical release?
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.960]   It was supposed to headline a film festival at an indie wire event, I think.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.320]   And that was-- it was pulled like days before its debut at the festival.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.280]   Yeah, it's something you know.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.440]   Interesting.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.600]   Yeah, but it was a purchase movie that they picked up.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.360]   So there-- so really, you can't blame Apple.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.520]   Well, you need to have some-- do you need to back off,
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.800]   figure out what the story is, and then decide what you want to do after that.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.040]   So that was-- I feel like that was a responsible thing to do.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.200]   So they've currently delayed the theatrical release.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.160]   Apple was supposed to--
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.040]   AFI festival.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.000]   --at the AFI festival.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.240]   Yeah, Apple was supposed to premiere it January.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:11.480]   Boy, I hate to see anything with Samuel L. Jackson not come out.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.600]   But that's one of the great things about these streaming services, where it's--
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.720]   these movies don't disappear.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.360]   They simply-- they get released when they get released.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.280]   If they mesh again to a theater this in December,
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.000]   all they need is a two-week run in New York and LA to qualify for the Oscar
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.320]   series. And if they decide-- if they determine that we don't believe that any of our fears
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:37.280]   or our fears were justified about this and we can legitimately release and stand by this movie,
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.720]   it can still be an Oscar contention.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.080]   However, no one will have seen it.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.760]   So maybe that's-- there's no point to that.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.640]   But they-- but the-- but the-- what I love about streaming services is that
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   you don't have these things where in network television where they didn't like--
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.520]   they bought-- they produced 12 or 13 episodes.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.760]   They aired three and then they canceled it.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.160]   And you'll never see even the 13 that were produced.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.720]   Whereas the worst you can fail is that, well, we'll let you go a whole season, but that's it.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.480]   You'll only get to do 13 to 22 episodes and that's it.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.440]   So it's-- at some point, if it is appropriate for this movie to be released
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.520]   with Apple not wanting to either bury it completely or sell it to somebody else,
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.720]   it will see the light of day.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.280]   I just think-- when we talk about the Oscar contingent,
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.000]   I just wonder how long this is going to last, like that we really care.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.680]   Well, the Irish-- we don't care about three hours long.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.000]   The directors care, the actors care, the producers care.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.800]   They love for now.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.280]   They do.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.000]   I mean, we're in this 10 years from now, will they care?
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.400]   I don't know.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:38.640]   People don't grow up dreaming about one day getting a three-year deal with Netflix and
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.000]   at exactly an 8% streaming HD share.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.880]   It's like you dream about the speech you're going to give your--
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.120]   you're in the bathroom holding your electric toothbrush.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.040]   I mean, let me tell you that you're thinking your mom--
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.080]   That-- yes, that--
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:50.960]   powerful mojo.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.480]   We're all caught in that little vortex at the moment.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.520]   Fantasy-- I know.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.520]   But the bottom's going to fall out of theaters.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.000]   We all know that.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Do they take time like people care about this?
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.120]   Fall out.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.400]   Like, there's going to be some point in the next five to 10 years where thousands of theaters close.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.640]   Like, let's-- I'm actually shocked it hadn't happened already.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.600]   The pressure's building.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.200]   You know, like, I look at-- like, right now, I will see a movie at an Atmos theater or an iMacs
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.440]   and really just the Atmos theater at this point.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.200]   And outside of that, I'm not going to pay that money.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:21.680]   We lost--
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.200]   But that's what I-- Here in Petaloma, we had movie theater.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:25.920]   It closed.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.680]   We'd had no movie theater.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.160]   A bunch of sixth graders started a petition drive.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.440]   And we built a movie theater.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.320]   He's an Atmos.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.400]   It had-- I don't know if-- yeah, it has Atmos.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.480]   It has a giant screen atmos, one screen.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.360]   But here's the thing.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.920]   It's a social event.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.600]   And I think for that reason, there may-- it may persist just because we still need places somewhere
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.200]   outside of our house that we can get together.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.400]   I think Disney is not going to be able to make a billion dollars off of a movie that they make for
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.200]   streaming.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.840]   I think that so long as there's this huge demand worldwide for these immense event movies that are
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.520]   just relentless-- Well, that's why we have so many Marvel comments.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.320]   But you want to see on a 60-foot screen.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.920]   It does have an amazing sound.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.960]   I agree with you.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.040]   But those immense movies do not pay for 12,000's theater screens.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.440]   No.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.920]   They pay for 2,000 screens or 4,000 screens.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.960]   Well, but--
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.360]   So I don't think theaters are going to go away.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.000]   I think that you do want to see the big--
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.120]   I went to see-- my son and I went to see Midway because I just want-- I like World War II movies.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.240]   It was a horrible movie, by the way.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.760]   Really?
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.840]   But it was made up for for the fact that the sound and the audio and the thing was--
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   Pearl Harbor was like that a couple of years ago.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.200]   Pearl Harbor was worse than Midway.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.680]   That movie because it was great sound effects.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.600]   Midway felt like-- and I don't know how-- I mean, I know a little bit.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   It felt a lot more accurate than Pearl Harbor.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.320]   In fact, it felt like they almost slaved a little bit more--
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.040]   It's too accurate.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.120]   Yeah, to be more accurate about telling a story than Pearl Harbor was just like,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.480]   we have a bunch of ships blowing up.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.200]   You know, it's not--
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.240]   That's about as close as it got.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.480]   So this is an interesting story than in this light.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.440]   This is Variety.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.200]   There was an art theater in New York City.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.600]   The Paris Theater was the last single-screen theater in New York.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.680]   One of the oldest art movie houses in the United States.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.120]   It was closed earlier this year.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.960]   Netflix has decided to reopen it and keep it open.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.000]   Which is changing the long because you couldn't do that before.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.040]   As a career.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.960]   There was a Paramount-- I think it was the Paramount--
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.600]   It was a huge--
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.320]   --the Paramount--
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:26.880]   --decision--
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.840]   --antitrust decision.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.960]   In the '40s where--
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   All the movie companies were involved because they both made the movies
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.040]   and owned the means of distribution.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.720]   And it was a big antitrust settlement.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.000]   They were forced to divest.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.720]   Right, because I think one of the problems they had was that only theaters were--
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.360]   You know, certain studios were only putting out the movies
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   to their own theaters and then it became this chaos.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.200]   You really can't be controlling both the product and the means of distribution.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.560]   But now they're opening it up because the theaters are going under.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.280]   And I do think--
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.160]   It does.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.920]   It actually proves your point.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.480]   And the irony of this is that--
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.080]   A streaming company is keeping it open.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080]   The streaming company is keeping it open.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.240]   And also the future is actually, I believe, single-screen experiences.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.680]   Single-screen theaters because--
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.120]   Well, look at the Alamo draft apps.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.040]   Don't you love going to the Alamo draft apps?
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:11.680]   I don't.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.400]   You go there.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.040]   You have a beer.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.000]   You have some tacos.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.120]   You watch a movie.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.240]   It's programmed.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.360]   So even the shorts and the feature are all programmed together, you don't like it.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:21.920]   No, I don't.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.400]   Why not?
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.280]   I like--
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.240]   No, Atlas.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.120]   Great sound.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:25.840]   Great color.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.320]   Great color.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.520]   Like, I do-- I care about that.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.280]   I don't like people.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.800]   Honestly, if that's what you care about, you will be able to duplicate that at home better.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.160]   No, I don't think so.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:34.720]   Steve Jobs.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.560]   I'm not convinced you can't--
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.360]   You can't have you--
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.400]   Look, you get a nice big--
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400]   OK, I can't--
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   8TR 4K screen.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:42.960]   And I have that.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.720]   And you get a great surround sound system.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:44.880]   I have that.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.000]   And you sit six feet away.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.240]   I don't know what the difference is, except you don't have kids kick your seat.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.320]   Well, OK, so the difference between iMacs or Dolby Atmos and what I have at home, which is really nice.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.560]   I mean, what I have at home is nice.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.280]   It is night and day.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.200]   I mean, the seats literally rumble, not because they have a rumble seat.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.640]   It's because the base is--
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.600]   They do have those bigs.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.880]   You know, like, it is--
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.240]   The whole thing-- everything vibrates.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.080]   And you don't have anybody.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.720]   When you go to, like, let's say at Dolby Atmos or iMacs, you don't have those crazy people
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.120]   who are complaining about it being too loud.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.920]   You just-- when you go there, you know it's going to be loud.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.280]   Like, that's why you went.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.800]   You know, and you hear the majority.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.000]   That's the majority.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.360]   Because I feel like--
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.040]   Most movies we will watch at home.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:27.440]   No, no, I don't--
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.600]   But there's a social-- for instance, the Star Wars--
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.200]   When the Star Wars movie comes out, we'll buy opening night tickets and we'll go.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.480]   Because it's a social thing.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.440]   Yes.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.320]   For-- and I think for event movies, that's what will continue to go to theaters.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.360]   I just don't think-- I think there's a whole bunch of movies that we used to see in theaters
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.560]   that are romantic comedies and dramas and all of a sudden--
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.280]   Those are going to be--
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:47.920]   That's going to go away.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.640]   And when that's gone.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.760]   And when that goes away--
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.160]   Movies are going to be like going to concerts, right?
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:52.640]   Yes.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.240]   When it's an experience that you can share and want to share with others.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.920]   And it's a big deal, like you said, like the Star Wars movies and things like that.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.240]   Great.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:00.720]   Let's go.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.520]   Let's all do it.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.560]   But otherwise, the couch-- and I think we need to--
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:13.200]   Certainly not assume that the past of this movies need to make billions or hundreds of millions
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.360]   to be successful is the future.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.200]   Because that is not how the music industry exists now.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.400]   And it certainly used to be that kind of thing, right?
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.600]   You didn't-- now you release an album and it's like, well, what does it take?
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.840]   35,000 copies or something and you chart?
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.320]   You know?
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:28.880]   Doesn't take very much.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.400]   The other thing is that I think that what we're going to see as it moves more and more
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.960]   toward streaming is a loosening of how those performances can be done.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.520]   Because part of the reason that we see them in big theaters is that there's a huge amount
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.920]   of overhead and legality and everything else of a public performance of a movie.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:54.320]   If we could have big 80s screens and Starbucks and have a coffee house and have dramas that
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.560]   we're going to have a drama night and we're going to do it.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.640]   But the problem-- you can't do that right now because it's illegal.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.760]   But that's what the album looks like.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.200]   You know, Apple has this thing where they can pump music into-- like they're paving the
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.520]   way for exactly what you just described.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.400]   I just said, I mean, that's what Apple's dress house is.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.000]   It's a taco joint that shows movies.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.160]   If it's not expensive, if it's not super expensive to go to it and it's a casual thing
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.320]   and we've all decided to go to watch this and have fun with it.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.520]   I mean, like when you go to see--
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.640]   People still go to restaurants.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.000]   Right.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.200]   And you can cook at home.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:27.680]   Exactly.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.200]   But there's a social element to that.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.080]   You're saying if you added movies, then people would still go to movies.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.400]   I think if you made some for some movies-- I mean, you look at like-- what is it?
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.560]   For some reason, it's the one we all throw stuff around everywhere.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.320]   Rocky Horror.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:42.880]   Rocky Horror.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.640]   You know, that is a-- you do not go to watch the movie.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   Everybody's seen the movie 100 times.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.680]   You're going to do the--
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.400]   That's a social--
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.800]   You know, and so the thing is is that-- but I think that also people like a book club or whatever,
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.120]   people would love to all go to the kind of movies that they want to see.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.040]   Like I love-- and they did it here in Petaluma and I think they still do it in Nevada
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.520]   where they have-- and I almost bought a screen so I could do it-- is doing like outdoor in the
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:07.520]   park.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.400]   Yeah, they still do that.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.000]   A lot of places do that now.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.640]   That's so much fun.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.680]   And it's actually not that expensive--
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.200]   You're always terrible movies.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.480]   You don't really want to see.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.120]   But who cares?
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.080]   You're having a good time.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:16.960]   You're sitting on a blanket.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.000]   You're on a blanket.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:18.640]   You're hanging out.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.080]   Jay says something interesting in our chatroom.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.360]   He says Ford versus Ferrari, which is normally the kind of movie I would say.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.480]   I'll just watch that at home.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.680]   People love it.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.760]   It did $30 million the first weekend.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.720]   He says, you want to see it because of the cinematography.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.280]   Right, right, right.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.960]   And so movies that go to theaters are going to have to have not necessarily big effects,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.760]   but--
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.680]   They don't have to be Marvel comic universe.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.720]   They have to have big-- they have to be big cinema--
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.880]   The shooting really has to own the space and the sound of--
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.440]   And the world mode.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.400]   --which I use as an example because that was a Netflix movie.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.040]   One Oscars should have won Best Picture probably didn't because it was a Netflix movie.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:55.200]   Right.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.560]   Alfonso Cuaron was an amazing movie in Black and White.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.040]   That would have been great in theaters.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.200]   I think, in fact, because in order to get into a cameo where they had to release in theaters
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.240]   for a couple of weeks, but it was never really a theatrical film.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.800]   But nobody's going to release a Black and White theatrical film.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.200]   Yet I think that would have looked fantastic on a big subject.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.560]   But I think it makes sense to say, hey, we're going to have a single theater.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.600]   Like if you look at the San Rafael-- not the San Rafael theater,
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.480]   the cinema one in "Quorta Madeira."
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.960]   That's "Lucas's Theater" basically.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.320]   "Lucas's Theater" basically.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.960]   It's a giant theater, a giant screen.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.080]   Little rundown.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:32.720]   Single screen.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.520]   Little rundown.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.960]   Like, what a great sound.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.320]   It was the first THX theater.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:42.720]   And what I'd love to see is someone come in with Dolby Atmos for the screen
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.920]   and then put in a "Myer Sound" constellation into the theater.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.760]   And then it's going to change every week.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.320]   Here's the deal.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.040]   There's going to be a great movie that's great to see on that screen.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.000]   And you get one weekend during the week to watch it.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.440]   And then we're going to change it every week.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.720]   And people would-- I know I would go every-- not every week, but I'm going right now.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.120]   I see three or four movies in a theater a year.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.200]   And I'd probably go back to one every month.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.960]   Maybe twice a month into a theater that was really high quality.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.560]   All right.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.520]   Question for you all.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.480]   How bad is iOS 13?
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.120]   Oh, it's horrible.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.040]   I literally-- I didn't realize-- I didn't think I could ever get to this point where I've turned
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.680]   off automatic update on everything.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.480]   Like, I'm just afraid of what's going to happen next on my Apple TV.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.640]   I had an Apple TV that updated and then just died.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.200]   Like, it literally just stopped working.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.240]   And so I--
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.720]   iOS 13 is better than it used to be.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.280]   Well, it's the best after weekly updates over two months.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:45.760]   Of course.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.920]   It's the best version of iOS 13.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.200]   That's right.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.040]   So, a really interesting scoop from Mark Gurman.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.200]   This is not something Apple has announced.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.600]   Software chief Craig Federighi is overhauling development and testing of iOS 14
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:07.280]   after what Apple considers a very flawed iOS--
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.000]   Otherwise known as a disaster.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.480]   They announced this at a recent internal kickoff meeting with the company's software
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.080]   developments developers.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.760]   The new approach calls for Apple's development teams to ensure that test versions,
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:26.320]   known as daily builds of future software updates, disable unfinished or buggy features by default.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.280]   Testers will then have the option to selectively enable these features.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.800]   So, I think this is addressing the issue that they had a huge public beta of iOS 13
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.840]   and yet it's still shipped with massive show-stopping flaws.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.600]   Yeah, I think the article doesn't.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:48.800]   So, they're definitely doing this, but there was a lot of confusion about the article because
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.560]   flags are something that everybody does.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.320]   Like people were saying Apple never did this before.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.680]   That's what they call every company.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.120]   The selective options turn on stuff.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.240]   They did.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.720]   And what this is is something different because it was just becoming impossible to internally
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.760]   test things.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.040]   And a lot of stuff aren't public.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.120]   Even in the public betas, things that affect upcoming hardware and things that are features
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.000]   that aren't released yet, those don't get put into the general beta pool.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.920]   Or when they're pulled, the beta is not testing them anymore and internal people are going through,
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   they call it purple restore.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.480]   That's what they do internally because it comes from the project purple.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.160]   But they're purple restoring their devices.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.440]   They don't always have the latest thing.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.680]   They can't always run the latest thing because their project needs them to be stable on something else.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.720]   And this sounds like a better way of managing internal testing,
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.080]   but also modularizing some of the components that they're working on.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.720]   Gurman writes, "Test software got so crammed with changes at different stages of development in
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.280]   iOS 13 that the devices often became difficult to use because of this.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.640]   Some testers would go days without a livable build.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.480]   So they really wouldn't have a handle on what's working and not working."
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.080]   He's quoting an unnamed source here.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.400]   "This defeated the main goal of the testing process as Apple engineers struggled to check
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   how the operating system was reacting to many of the new features."
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.920]   So the other side of this is that iOS 14 will probably be more of a snow leopard update.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.960]   Oh, I hope so.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.520]   I literally would be okay if they just stopped working on anything new and just got this working.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.440]   I'd never seen it.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:24.000]   When my wife says, "Everything we do runs through an Apple TV and when she said,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.600]   'Can we get something that's less buggy?'
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.520]   When my wife says that, not me, I mean, I can be picking it out a lot of that."
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.080]   What pucks have you had?
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.120]   When it updated, our Apple TV stopped allowing you to move the cursor.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.640]   You couldn't go anywhere in the cursor.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.600]   And literally, the only fix was to finally just...
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.240]   I had another Apple TV that was a test unit that I had bought to test other things.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.400]   So I just put it into place.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.200]   I haven't had any problems with TVOS, although I do have one Apple TV after reboot frequently.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:05.680]   Because it gets funky.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.560]   And then my iPhone was doing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.640]   The iPhone I've had actually freeze.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.800]   I was taking a picture and it not only froze, I had to hard reset it.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.360]   And then with Catalina, I got so many warnings from the production tools that I use that I haven't
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.040]   even thought about updating.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.120]   How much of this is just this suffers?
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.240]   I mean, well, for Catalina, the problem is they dropped 32-bit.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.720]   So that's a huge...
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.280]   There's a lot of...
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:29.760]   There's not a bug.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.320]   That's a...
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.520]   But there's a lot of apps that aren't ready yet for that.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.880]   And so that's been a big thing for Catalina.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.920]   I think a lot of this was just a lot of features.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:40.640]   Too many.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.880]   Well, I'll cheer at WWDC when Apple says, "And in iOS 14, we've added nothing."
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.040]   Thanks.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.200]   Well, they've already announced some new features.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.520]   I know there's going to be new features, unfortunately.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   I just have two requests from them and they don't really...
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.360]   I mean, quality, yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.800]   But it's just a quantity thing.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.200]   Like iOS 12 to me was the perfect roadmap.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.400]   Half the amount of features they usually cram in and the other half of the time
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.440]   is spent not just paying down technical debt, what you can do, what you can do.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.800]   But engineering out of dead ends that they'd gotten themselves into in the past,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.600]   things that caused the delay for products like HomePod,
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.760]   because they had to go back and fix AirPlay with AirPlay 2 and some of the core audio stuff.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.440]   But fixing that stuff takes time and you have to give people the time to do that.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.680]   But also get rid of coming in September and call it starting in September.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.280]   And then have a September release, have an October release, a December release,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.720]   some February, March, whatever, and ship things over like do a roadmap for the year.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.080]   And they don't feel like you have to rush everything out because stuff gets delayed anyway.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.760]   You might as well plan it successfully and not just always...
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.560]   I appreciate it.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.600]   I appreciate it.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.480]   Microsoft has done a good job with that, with Windows.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.120]   Google has done a really great job with that, with Android,
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:53.360]   where guests that will have the big PR event, where here is where the odometer ticks over to
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:23:00.320]   another integer level. But it's just a constant stream of features that become available as soon
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.000]   as they feel as though they're ready to go. So yeah, I would love to see that Apple do that.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   I think that's the best advice Renee could give anybody.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.680]   I like it.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.320]   Excuse me.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.360]   I'm probably used to that.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.520]   Because you give it to me, but I couldn't do much with it.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.840]   Well, I'll use to the subscription software model right now, where it just evolves.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.160]   When the feature is ready to come out.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.560]   And so let's do that with the operating system.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.880]   It does screw with what developers can do, though.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   So they have to manage some level of that.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:32.000]   If they're given clarity, like my message sync was with three months delayed,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.120]   if they just said it's coming three months later, everyone's fine with it.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.400]   Or yeah, especially if that means that you're telling developers,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.760]   by the way, we have actually now walked down the API for this.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.320]   There will be no further changes to this.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.520]   You will not have to cancel the trip that you planned.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.080]   A month after the release of this operating system, because you figured that everything that
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.160]   you would have to do in order to qualify for an app store release would be ready and finished
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:56.880]   and enable.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.200]   The one of the most frustrating things, I think anybody who is in regular contact with Apple
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   developers is that they just feel as though Apple is maintaining this adversarial relationship with
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.600]   them, where they're saying you do not have an option.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.880]   Your app has to support this for iOS 13.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.280]   Well, great.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.160]   How do we support that?
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.280]   Well, we're still working it out.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.640]   Well, do you give a sample code?
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.200]   Yeah, but in two months, we might actually revoke it and you might have to redo everything anyway.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.560]   So I think most of the developers would take that deal.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.320]   If they said that, by the way, you will no longer know exactly when the new feature is going to
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:30.880]   be released.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.960]   You will not be given a date or a date or a target.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:38.080]   But the thing is, at this point, we know now that when we tell you that an API is locked down,
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.200]   we fix the bugs.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:44.640]   You will not have to write this code a third or fourth or fifth time as the ability to plan a
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:49.680]   trip to Disney World with the kids and not have to send your spouse and your kids off without you
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.800]   would be worth whatever other problems that are created by that system.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.280]   That requires a new way of thinking from Apple, though.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.120]   That's not how they've traditionally done it.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:24:59.280]   Right?
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.640]   It's like, we're going to work on it until that developers are human beings.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.480]   It would be quite a shift to acknowledge that.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.240]   Well, you know, yeah, they're robots.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.400]   Let's take a little time out.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.000]   Then if you would get your picks ready, Dave Hamilton from the Mac Observer,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.080]   also a host of one of the longest running.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.760]   Do we ever figure out if your podcast is older than this podcast?
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.960]   We I don't know that we figured that out.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.360]   Mac Geekab started on June 13, 2005.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.560]   Wow.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.160]   That's when we think it might be older.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.120]   When did we start Mac break?
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.800]   I think well, Mac break itself.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.520]   See the video.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.960]   January, the video version.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.160]   January, 2005.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.440]   But I think Mac break weekly was later, but I don't remember what the first date was.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.040]   But I know that we went out.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.200]   It was with Emery who just closed up $50 million around.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:51.600]   What?
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.960]   For what?
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.600]   Frame my own.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.800]   Congratulations.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.520]   He's from my own.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.040]   Congratulations, Emery.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.120]   Yes, it was Emery and they are just taking over.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.280]   But Emery and Amber MacArthur and you and I.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.560]   That was how we started.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.120]   We did.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.840]   It was a reason you know it was January because it was Mac World Expo.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.160]   Yep.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.600]   And then I don't remember when we started the audio version of it.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.400]   Mac break weekly.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   That's it.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.120]   It came after that.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.920]   So you started for the iTunes Store was before the podcast.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.600]   Oh, that's for sure true.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.480]   Because we were only in for about two weeks.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.400]   I had the email Steve to make sure we got in the directory because it was happening so quickly.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:37.760]   I could say actually twits.tv/mbw1 is the hardest episode.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.960]   August, no, you beat us.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.480]   August 12th, 2006.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.080]   But see, that's I don't that's when we took it over.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:44.800]   Right.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.040]   Because we were doing it longer than that.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.920]   And we were doing we were releasing every week for Mac break.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.640]   For well after the first one.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.480]   Because we recorded like 20,000.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.440]   And we recorded it.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:55.520]   We recorded it.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.080]   We recorded it.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:56.560]   We recorded it.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.440]   We recorded it well after you.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.200]   But I think we were we had this is not the first Mac break weekly.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.480]   It's just the first one on the twit.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:02.720]   Right.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.560]   And because we were doing it.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.680]   And but yeah, we recorded like 20 episodes in 10 and
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.440]   20 in 2005.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.840]   And then I couldn't get it done.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840]   So then we the road to 10 and EP.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.480]   We did one.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.640]   The first one was the live one we did which is really fast.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.520]   Because nobody can watch anyway because no hard work could handle 10 and EP.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.000]   Was that.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.480]   That's how long ago that was.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.120]   Details.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.960]   You know, but.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.720]   Shut it on a old Lucas.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.960]   Yeah, I bought we I bought two.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.360]   EX.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:33.920]   No, no, no.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.240]   P.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.560]   Um, F nine fifties which were the they were the Star Wars cameras for episode two and three and
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.000]   then literally the model cameras.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.200]   Yeah, yeah, but they were literally the cameras not not kind.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   There was actual camera one was serial number for one was zero zero zero zero and the other
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.640]   one was zero zero ten.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.160]   You know, you know, it was to do 1080p back in those.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.920]   Well, when we had two x-rays an x-ray for each camera to get what so that the speed that we had
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.920]   to get was we had to reach 228 megabytes per second, which now, you know, is on our
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.440]   phone, you know, the phone will do that.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:08.880]   And so, but but back then it was a big it was big.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.400]   I built the test the camera.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.760]   I built the first raid that I built the rate, not the first rate.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.960]   I built a raid that was 130 gigs or something.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.640]   It was a whole raid 130 gigs that was but it was fast enough to capture from the camera.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.800]   Then we got two x-rays and Mark Alameo bought the other camera.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.880]   And so because the cameras were even used.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:38.160]   Used the cameras were $82,000 each.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.120]   So we're going to give you Dave the order of the oldest Mac podcast, Mac Eat Cab.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.480]   Well, at least here.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.840]   There were some microphone.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.360]   There were some before, but longest running.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.080]   Longest running.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:46.720]   Give it to you.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.000]   We bequeathed.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.400]   Thank you.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.480]   Well, you're on episode 790.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.240]   So we're only on 689.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.000]   So if for that reason alone, you're way ahead of us.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:56.720]   It's great to have you.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.920]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.800]   Thanks for having me.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.600]   We're not done.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.320]   I need a pick.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.920]   I'm going to be joined like this OG panel.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.240]   I know.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:02.640]   I love it.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.760]   This is an OG panel.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.000]   Isn't it?
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   I'm more as Renee Richie is also here from, he does the vector podcast, which is newer.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.320]   But I'm a baby.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   Very, very good at I'mmore.com.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.120]   Excellent.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:15.680]   That's really excellent.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.240]   Thank you.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:22.720]   Our show today, and of course, Andy and Aco, who you'll hear every week on WGBH in Boston.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   I take pride in being one step behind the mass media.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   I went from, I left newspapers to go into terrestrial radio.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.520]   So next he'll be doing 78 RPM records.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.840]   I'm hoping to have an Archie server on the on the ARPANET by 2020.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.240]   And you get golfer first.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:42.800]   Go for it.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.440]   Our show today brought to you by Metallic, which is just a great name.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.040]   It's a Commvault venture.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.840]   Metallic brings you powerful enterprise grade backup and recovery technology.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.840]   Through a simple SaaS delivery.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:01.040]   That means it's easy to install, easy to use, and you're guaranteed to get fast,
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:06.000]   secure backups and granular restores to protect you against data loss.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.720]   It's built on Commvault's core technology, but it's an easy delivery.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.920]   It's unique because it'll scale across multiple workloads while mitigating the risk of data loss,
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:21.360]   security threats, and things like losing access to data in Microsoft Office 365.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   If your business runs on Office, that's a terrible thought.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.200]   But thanks to Metallic, you don't ever have to worry about it.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.400]   Also, a thing of the past poor backup performance.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.360]   It's fast.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.080]   It's easy.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.680]   It offers default storage through Azure, or you can bring your own.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:43.360]   It has the capability to do backup recovery and migration from on-premises to the cloud.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.800]   Some of the products Metallic offers our metallic core backup and recovery.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.000]   That'll protect physical and virtual servers on-prem.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.640]   And in the cloud, with comprehensive backup and recovery for VMware, for files,
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:59.760]   for file servers, Windows and Linux and Microsoft SQL databases.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.240]   Then this is so great.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.520]   I think this is really a Microsoft Office 365 backup and recovery with Metallic,
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.560]   which protects your mailboxes, your contacts, your calendar items.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.520]   And it doesn't matter if it's on SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, or just on OneDrive.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.880]   You get unlimited Azure storage, and I love this.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.000]   And for a lot of businesses, this is a requirement, unlimited retention.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.880]   A lot of reasons you might want to do that for legal reasons and regulatory reasons.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.680]   That's Metallic Office 365 backup and recovery.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.160]   There's also Metallic Endpoint backup and recovery.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.160]   You have endpoints.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.720]   You have desktops and laptops and phones.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.080]   Protect them against deletion, corruption, and malicious attacks.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.400]   And of course, it's always secured with date, with encryption, geo location, and
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.560]   because these things often go missing, remote wipe functionality.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.320]   With Metallic, you'll be up and running in as little as 15 minutes,
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.720]   and you'll get simpler data protection operations with less downtime and seamless scaling,
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.280]   and all with no big upfront investment.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.560]   Safeguard your data.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.880]   You know the business runs on it.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.040]   With Metallic, they'll give you consistency, flexibility, and scalability,
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.120]   because they're in the cloud.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.440]   Whether you're protecting a terabyte or a thousand.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.680]   Safeguard your data now.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.560]   I believe that's a...
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:15.840]   petabyte.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.880]   Whether you're protecting a terabyte or a petabyte.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.840]   Or more.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.640]   Safeguard your data now and later with all the benefits of SaaS.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.080]   With Metallic, a Commvault venture.

[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.760]   Time for your picks, boys.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.280]   Boys, I could say that because Lori's out.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.400]   Is she going to be back next week?
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:54.880]   Do we know?
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.200]   Yeah, she's back tomorrow.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.560]   I think she's touring in Japan with her band.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.000]   She's sick burning all of Japan.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.280]   How has her bootycon performance been?
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:03.840]   Is it good?
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.360]   Is she getting great reviews?
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.440]   Or are the Apple haters going after her too?
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.760]   If you've got a Lori Gill on Instagram,
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.880]   you'll see the most marvelous photos of her totally rocking Japan.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.520]   So, I can't wait to hear.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.480]   She'll be on next week.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.160]   We'll hear all about it.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.440]   L-O-R-Y-G-I-L-L, right?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.840]   Thank God for Instagram.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.320]   I didn't want to help.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.120]   50 years from now, so many little kids are going to be able to say,
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.520]   "Nana, you were such a rocker than that ass."
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.720]   Thanks to Instagram.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.360]   Oh, shoot.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.560]   The account is private.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.080]   Oh, no.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.280]   Oh, man.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.880]   Well, I'm going to have to beg her to let me follow her.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.160]   Alex, Lindsay, why don't you kick it off with your pick of the week this week?
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.400]   So, I like to label things.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.160]   Are you--
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.360]   Tell me about it.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.600]   Are you one of those guys who has the light switches labeled on and off?
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.000]   I don't have them labeled on and off,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.760]   but I may have them labeled at what they do.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.400]   Oh, God.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.000]   You know, which I get--
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.400]   I just want to say, I get that legally because my grandfather,
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.800]   when I grew up all over his house,
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.400]   the light switches would have--
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.840]   You remember the one that was like a little circle and you rotate it,
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.920]   and then you'd click it and it would press through the--
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.720]   Into the plastic.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.360]   Oh, my God.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.400]   And he had those everywhere.
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.520]   So I grew up with--
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.400]   And I grew up doing that, and I was thinking about that the other day
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.000]   because I now have this, which is--
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.120]   What?
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.360]   Cube.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.440]   This is not a labeled printer.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.560]   This is just a thing.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.760]   So, so if I--
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.440]   So this is a-- this is a Brother Cube.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.200]   See, I have a Brother P-touch.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.120]   But it's got a keyboard on it.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.080]   This doesn't have a keyboard.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:32.960]   This is like the one with the keyboard,
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.440]   except that it's just a cube and it just connects to your iPhone.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:36.800]   What?
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.560]   What?
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.600]   Can I do it with the iPad?
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.800]   Because I like a real keyboard.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.120]   Yep.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.160]   Anything that you want to--
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.600]   So it's an iOS attached.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.280]   It's just Bluetooth connected, and then you have a little--
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:45.920]   So it's just really--
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.640]   It's a printer.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.440]   See, then you just go--
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.160]   I go, OK, I want to put some text in, and I go--
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.920]   Leo's--
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.440]   What?
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.800]   Uh, stuff.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.680]   Wait, how do you cut it?
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.480]   Do you have a little--
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.160]   You need a little button to cut it.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:58.880]   You don't.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.240]   So yeah, I say, OK, I want--
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.400]   Leo's stuff.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.200]   I'm going to put this on all my stuff.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.640]   Well--
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.200]   Well--
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:08.240]   I got it.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.280]   That's the leader.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.160]   Oh, that's the leader.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:10.480]   Because it's--
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.360]   Which, by the way, is useful.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.000]   I keep that.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:12.800]   Keep that for something.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.040]   So what I do is I use these little leaders as--
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.680]   I put them on stuff that I don't know if I'm going to label yet,
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.280]   but I can use a Sharpie on them.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.200]   So I stick them on stuff all the time.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.080]   Little stuff.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.720]   And it's already--
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:22.720]   Oh, it's--
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.600]   It should print it down.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.400]   It's already cut.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.680]   And it's beautiful.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.520]   Oh, man.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.640]   Yeah, stuff.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.960]   There is a p-touch cube and a p-touch cube plus get the plus.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.440]   Get the plus.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.960]   I really want this because I--
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.760]   I-- that keep it--
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.160]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.240]   --it would be so much nicer just to do this.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.280]   And it comes from a computer, it doesn't have to be an iOS device.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.800]   I'm sure that you can do it from a computer.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.200]   I feel like it's a printer.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:43.840]   I've never tried it.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.280]   It's just like a Wi-Fi.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.920]   Because it's so easy to get it working on your phone.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.560]   Oh, it's Bluetooth.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.360]   So when we're working, we'll have this thing sitting just somewhere.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.400]   And everyone's just kind of a--
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.440]   You're just printing out lots of labels.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.000]   Oh, man.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.760]   And it is--
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.480]   And there's--
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.760]   Now, the plus also handles a lot of different widths
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.240]   and different types over the regular one.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:11.360]   And it is super flexible, super easy that you can very quickly,
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.000]   you know, print a lot of stuff out.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.360]   So anyway--
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360]   So it'll take lots of different widths.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.720]   Yeah, it has lots of different widths.
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.280]   I think it's--
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.440]   Maximum is like an inch and a half, I think.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.800]   Oh, or an inch.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:23.280]   An inch.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:23.760]   One inch.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.040]   And they have like an inch, one inch gold.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.760]   And I have black and--
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.880]   I do white on black and black on white, mostly.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.040]   And I have ones that are really thin.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.040]   They go right on the edge of an SSD.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.960]   And then I have other ones that are big that are easy to read.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.520]   It's a kinkie.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.440]   And then I have like a whole little--
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.800]   And the thing is, I thought I was--
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.480]   It's actually kinkie because I was like 12 different types.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.400]   I was prepared for this to cost $400, $500.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.600]   Oh, it's $100.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.640]   $100.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.040]   And it--
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.960]   Well, the funny thing is, I thought that I was a kinkie.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.920]   You should look down below.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.120]   I think it's on this one.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.080]   No, it won't be on brother.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.200]   It'll be on Amazon.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.600]   So I thought I was a kinkie because I have like 12 different tapes,
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.800]   you know, some different widths and black on white and white on black.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.360]   Oh, they get premium glitter, gold on premium glitter white.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.000]   Ooh.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.440]   So I thought that I was a kinkie because I have this little box that carries all of those.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.320]   On Amazon, you see a whole different world.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.360]   There are people who have like cases that are just to hold all the different tapes they use
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.720]   with this printer.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.120]   And you know, people are very geeky about it.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.560]   And I was like, oh, I should hire.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.600]   I should--
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.040]   Those are my kind of people.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.520]   But Alex, it makes no sense.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.880]   How would they organize all those tapes in a box without knowing what's in what part of the box?
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.760]   See, that's the best part.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.880]   You just label it.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.320]   So if you go to like--
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:34.800]   It's only--
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.280]   I couldn't use this 83 bucks on Amazon.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.160]   So it's not--
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.360]   I do have to question that you don't have a label on the label maker, Alex.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.400]   I don't know if you're real--
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.520]   I was just noticing that.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.080]   --that it is.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.520]   Oh my gosh.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.200]   Yeah, none of these people on Amazon have labeled their label maker.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.640]   That's the first label I made with my label maker because I put it right on the label--
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.680]   Is it label as label maker?
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.400]   Oh, that's the wrong label.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.160]   Yes, I did label it as label maker.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.560]   See, that's how we know the quality of set theory.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.520]   There's some label makers that scroll down.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.120]   Scroll down and see if it has--
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.960]   See if it has the case.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.400]   No, it's some of the reviews.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:06.880]   Some people will show.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.160]   He's going to the reviews, Leo.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:09.760]   Oh.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.600]   You'll see if people like with their--
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.960]   They'll post like--
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:13.920]   Oh, look at this guy.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.400]   Look at this guy.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.520]   Look, open that up.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:16.160]   What the--
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:16.720]   What?
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.600]   That's living.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.720]   See, that's living right there.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.560]   You got a little case.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.080]   You got it with all your different tapes.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.560]   I think that on any dating app, if you have a case like this,
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.640]   you are required to bring it to the first date
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.800]   so this person knows, but they are incorrect.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.760]   Oh.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.760]   I'm saying that you're definitely in for something.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.400]   But it is going to label you.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   So if you use the--
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.120]   This is a game card case,
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.360]   but it happens to fit these very nicely.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.320]   [SIGHS]
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:46.720]   So--
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.360]   OK, fine.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.000]   OK, fine.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.400]   I bought it now because I could get it tomorrow.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.320]   Try it now, man.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.160]   And I put lots of things like my rice maker.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.280]   I think we should replace John's label maker.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280]   This pathetic old--
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.520]   Wait a minute, he's got John's label maker.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.800]   He has a label on it.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.280]   Of course.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   It's called John's label maker.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.040]   That's authenticity, man.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.360]   What would the--
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.320]   What's important, like--
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.280]   Solidarity.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.200]   You really get into this in production because we've
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.440]   literally gotten equipment back worth hundreds of dollars
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.240]   from production.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.480]   Because it had an address.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.560]   Look, it just-- there was an address printed on it.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.040]   And so--
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:21.840]   Oh, hell, I literally--
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.120]   If I kicked myself--
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.880]   We got a package back from CT.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.000]   You've gotten it, John.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:26.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.240]   So we get these packages back.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.160]   And it's like $500 worth of electronics
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.440]   that-- and the only reason it was there
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.200]   is because we put stuff on it.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.840]   And so-- but I put on-- I also use it for kind hints.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:42.240]   Like the rice cooker has a sticker on it that just says,
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:45.760]   only use plastic paddle.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.240]   You know, because we're using--
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.080]   Little hints.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:48.920]   Little hints.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.880]   Little things like that.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.000]   I didn't put a swear word in it,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.600]   but I wouldn't.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.280]   Scratch in my rice cooker.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.080]   How long is the battery last on this thing?
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:57.760]   I don't know.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.400]   I literally don't know, because I kind of just
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.080]   plug it in all--
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.160]   Yeah, you can use it with a laptop, too.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:02.960]   But you can wander around.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.440]   It doesn't need to be plugged in.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.000]   And it's USB--
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.120]   USB C.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.000]   USB-- I'm sorry, USB Micro.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:10.640]   Oh, crap.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640]   Oh.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:12.120]   So--
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.640]   Cancel order with the 30 minutes.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.520]   Look at that, see?
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:16.960]   Look at that.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.600]   It's beautiful.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.120]   It's wonderful.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:18.800]   It's lightweight.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.560]   It's portable.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.640]   And you can print glitter labels.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.920]   Oh, look at that.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.960]   And the choices of fonts and everything else
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.680]   is so much higher than the last ones.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.640]   I can't tell you how many times I've kicked myself.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.560]   And I have a whole barrel of power supplies.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.120]   People-- companies, I don't know why.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.200]   Don't print the who the power supply goes with.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.720]   That's what I-- on all my power supply.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.160]   I sit around, I'm just typing--
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.840]   Why didn't I do that one?
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.920]   There should be a law.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.760]   Because I have all-- they fit, but they don't do anything.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.560]   Kind of thing.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.960]   Mr. McKee-Gab.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:50.960]   Dave Hamilton.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.400]   What do you got for us today?
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.840]   Easy for you to say.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.120]   I have a geeky tool that's free.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:57.720]   A geeky tool.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.880]   Called Time Machine Editor.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:05.640]   All one word from tclmndev.com.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.480]   Time machine will back up every hour.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.440]   And sometimes that's a little bit obsessive.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.560]   And other times, say, when you're podcasting,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.560]   you don't really want it to be doing that
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:20.520]   while your machine is, say, used doing other stuff.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.920]   So I set this.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.400]   It's evolved over the years.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.800]   This thing has existed for a long time.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.400]   And I set it up to back up when--
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.480]   what do I have mine set to?
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.680]   To back up when inactive.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.240]   And then that's it.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.960]   You just set it to back up when it inactive,
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.200]   and it'll do it.
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.040]   And as you can see there, you can pick time windows.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.520]   You can get crazy, though.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.720]   You can set calendar intervals and go nuts.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.600]   And it even comes with its own terminal command line utility
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.680]   if you want to get more status or better snaps.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.120]   Can I set it?
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.760]   I would love to change the number of snapshots it saves.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.600]   You can really fill up a drive with these--
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.280]   You can set whether or not snapshots are happening.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.720]   I'm looking at the TME/CTL, which is a terminal utility.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.640]   Yeah, this is cool.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.080]   And it's one of those things.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.200]   You kind of-- you know, Ronco, right?
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.320]   You set it and then forget it and you're done.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.720]   I'm going to say it's from tclamintdev.com.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.120]   I think that's a better way to say it.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.120]   Good guy.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.640]   I may have been podcasting longer, arguably, maybe not.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.880]   But you've been doing this broadcast the way it is.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.320]   I know you're going to split by URLs.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320]   Andy and I-- that's a good pick.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:32.840]   Thank you, Dave.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.440]   Andy and I go.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.080]   You're pick of the week.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.120]   I have a two-part--
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.800]   I wanted to remind everybody that the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.640]   is airing on Thanksgiving evening at 8 p.m.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:46.080]   It's a great pump.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.680]   Eastern time on ABC.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.200]   Is that--
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:48.720]   So--
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.480]   It's a great-- the great pumpkin
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.840]   Charlie Browner is at a different one.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.200]   No, that's a Halloween.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.520]   This is a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.280]   This is the Thanksgiving themed one.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:57.760]   It is--
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.760]   It's available for purchase on iTunes for--
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.360]   Yeah, but I was having--
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.960]   I was talking to a friend about this the other day
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.480]   that there's something about the appointment.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   Maybe it's just a generational thing where it's like, no,
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.640]   no, this is the time where--
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.880]   When you tweet about watching this,
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.600]   you'll get like 1,100 people talking--
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.360]   Oh, I'm watching it too.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.360]   Oh, this is my favorite scene.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:17.880]   Oh.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.840]   And there's something--
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.480]   And also, the other thing is that, again,
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.680]   if you're of a certain age, the Dolly Madison Zingers, which
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.320]   used to be a regional baked product that was advertised
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:30.080]   nationally so that when I was a kid, it would be--
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.640]   The only place I ever heard of Dolly Madison Zingers
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.920]   was the product was bought by Hostess.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.920]   So it is now available nationally.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.680]   So if you want to pick up a little three-pack of zingers,
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.560]   you can have the Dolly Madison Zingers
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.240]   while you're enjoying a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.200]   But ABC is also streaming it for free on ABC.com the next day.
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.080]   And as you said, you can buy--
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.720]   I'm not even going to discourage people
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.520]   from buying it on streaming, because when you see--
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:01.040]   especially if you grew up watching certain animations
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.480]   like on broadcast television, and now you're seeing it,
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.160]   they've remastered it from the original film at 4K.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.480]   And you can actually see the shadow
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.080]   between the cell layer and the background layer.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.840]   It's like, oh my god, I don't know why I deserve this,
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.160]   but this is wonderful.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.560]   I'm happy about this.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.840]   I'm sending a reminder to remind me
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.920]   at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern Thanksgiving.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.600]   Watch Charlie Brown.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.920]   Check local listings.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.400]   8 p.m. Eastern time, I'm sure it's
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.360]   on some reasonable amount of time.
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.520]   So by all means, tell all your uncles
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.760]   and your parents and grandparents
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.320]   to turn off the football that they're watching
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.680]   and switch over to Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.360]   Good luck with that, because I don't know.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.680]   And the other thing is, to everybody who's listing a case,
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.520]   this is the only time you get to hear a human voice say this,
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.680]   realize that your family consists of the people
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:55.120]   that you are issued at birth, and the people
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.080]   that you decided to acquire along the way
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.600]   during your journey on life.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.080]   And you get to choose which family
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.280]   you get to spend your holidays with.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.960]   So if your genetic family causes nothing but stress
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.640]   and frustration and disappointment,
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.200]   you have other family you can hang out with.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.120]   And also, hanging out with yourself
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.560]   and spending Thanksgiving alone is by all means,
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.440]   not a failure.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.880]   This is not a member that a lot of stress
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.080]   and a lot of anxiety is you will find actually optional.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.960]   And holiday anxiety is, again, often optional.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.880]   And remember that you don't have to go to places
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.800]   where you feel unloved, unsafe, and unappreciated.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.000]   Spend your holidays in a way that heals you and nourishes you.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.680]   And with the people that heal you and nurse you
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.560]   and whom you in return like to heal and nourish.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.520]   So God bless all of you.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.360]   - Preach on.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.160]   - No, I know why my kids aren't spending Thanksgiving with me.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.960]   (both laughing)
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:53.800]   Renee, Ricky.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:54.800]   - It's 'cause you're always asking them
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.800]   to fix your phones, Mr. Tech Guy.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.080]   - Can you figure out how to keep that thing
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.080]   from blinking and twat?
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:00.920]   - Oh, oh.
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.480]   - Dad, I'm not showing you TikTok.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480]   Stop asking.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.080]   - Why did you sign out of iCloud?
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.080]   But I'm still getting all my iMessages
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.280]   on my other laptop.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.440]   - How come every time I say, okay, boomer, Google wakes up?
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.280]   I don't...
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   (both laughing)
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.800]   I don't understand.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.160]   Renee, Richie, you're pick of the week.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.440]   - I just checked my local listings
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.800]   and Charlie Brown was on a month ago here.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.000]   So I got that for the US now.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:21.840]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:22.680]   - I'm just kidding.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.520]   - Because of the earlier harvest.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.360]   - Yes.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.520]   - So Apple has new smart battery cases out
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.440]   and they are for the iPhone 11 series now.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.040]   You can get them in black, pink, and white.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:35.880]   - Oh my God.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.240]   - They are essentially got all three colors.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.320]   - Well, I had to put the pink case on the green phone
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]   so I could reload the 70s.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.160]   - Yeah.
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.640]   - I mean, that was an easy choice.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.000]   They're essentially the same.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.080]   They have the same design that's not supposed to interfere
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.000]   with antennas.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.640]   It doesn't put your phone into plugged in mode.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:52.920]   It stays in mobile mode.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.440]   But the new thing they have this year
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.040]   is a dedicated camera button,
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.880]   which is recessed in there.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.560]   You hold it down for a hot second to launch the camera app.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.360]   If you just click it, nothing will happen initially
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.960]   because they don't want it to just go off
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.400]   willy-nilly in your pocket.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.440]   But if you hold it down, it'll launch the camera.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.600]   And then you can just click away as fast as you want
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:15.560]   to take shots or hold it down to take a quick video.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.160]   And unfortunately, it doesn't work like the volume keys.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.560]   So it won't work if you're using halide.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.480]   It doesn't work if you're using obscure.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.880]   I wish that they would just do that.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.200]   So it automatically does what the volume keys does
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.680]   and then it's one consistent button to rule them all
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:28.840]   in every app.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.280]   But for now, it's nice.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.000]   I understand why they don't put it on the phone
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.920]   because it's complexity and they're aiming towards simplicity.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.520]   But having it on this case, I'm a real big fan of that.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.760]   You just pull it out and go to work.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.280]   It adds 50% to the battery life.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.600]   Apple doesn't give hard numbers because it really varies.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.760]   Like if you're just doing a streaming video,
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.360]   it'll be like an extra five hours.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.200]   If you're doing local video, it might be an extra seven
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.200]   or eight hours.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.920]   But whatever you usually get during the course
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.400]   of your day, you'll get an extra 50% on top of that.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.080]   It does add weight because batteries,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:01.920]   they're a little bit heavy.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.960]   So it feels a bit like a brick.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.680]   You can't throw it at somebody for self-defense purposes.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.800]   Totally fine.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:10.600]   But otherwise, I'm a big fan of these.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.800]   I like them way better than carrying a brick in my pocket.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.000]   If I'm just going out, I get really, really good battery life
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]   on the iPhone 11, except for, and Leo knows both these things,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.840]   Pokemon Go events and traveling, especially when roaming,
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.280]   both those things.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.920]   There's no amount of artificial intelligence optimization,
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.920]   as Google has found out with a Pixel 4,
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.040]   that can get you through constant usage.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.080]   That is purely an engineering battery cell capacity problem.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.880]   So if you're going to do anything that requires
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.880]   sustained screen, GPS, GPU, CPU, any of those things,
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.920]   this will get you, if you used to get a day,
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.120]   it'll get you a day and a half.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.840]   If you got you until noon at the airport,
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.760]   this will get you until about 3 p.m.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.240]   (laughing)
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.720]   Now, do they make a model of this for the Google Pixel 4?
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:59.520]   No, but I really want one so bad in the latter.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.120]   Apple can make so much money if they
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.840]   made a version of this for the Pixel 4.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.920]   I took it out.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.160]   I did the usual thing.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.360]   I took them out to the Pokemon Go event last weekend,
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.040]   and the Google Pixel 4 did not finish the event.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.440]   I got three and a half hours out of it,
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.320]   and I got five hours, 20 minutes out of the iPhone 11.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.240]   I just wanted to case so badly.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.280]   And isn't it a calling that all those beautiful colorful
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.600]   creatures were allowed to roam free and live their lives
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.640]   instead of being captured by you?
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.360]   I like the funny flavor, yeah.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.760]   We talked about this on iOS today earlier with mycassargent,
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:33.880]   and what I didn't mention at the time was,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.480]   it's $179.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.400]   (laughing)
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.000]   Yeah, they're real proud of that thing.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.360]   And by the way, no discount for the smaller one.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.600]   It's the same price.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.320]   Oh, actually I think Micah did mention,
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.040]   did point this out, no matter what size phone you're getting,
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.480]   it's $179, even for the iPhone.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:54.280]   But to be fair, they've placed the battery
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.160]   so it doesn't interfere with antennas.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:58.240]   It's a very nicely integrated thing.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.360]   And also as nice as a lithium blister
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.040]   can look attached to a phone,
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.280]   it looks as nice as such a thing could possibly look so.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.920]   It's nice, soft silicone, I like the rubber.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.320]   And yeah, the main thing is the power thing,
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.880]   that Apple has a little bit of an inside track with this,
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:19.720]   and so it doesn't put it plugged in.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.880]   I believe other companies can do that part too.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.000]   Apple was just the first,
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.760]   they usually dog food their APIs first.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.880]   I believe that's available now.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.960]   But it's important because if your phone thinks it's plugged in,
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.040]   all of a sudden it's open season on network transfers,
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:35.120]   syncing, downloading apps, updating everything,
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.800]   and that just drains the battery away.
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.960]   Right.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.840]   I wanna briefly mention a pick that I discovered
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.720]   a couple of days ago.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.280]   I haven't had a whole lot of chance to use it,
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.120]   but it's free and it's impressive.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.560]   It's a screen capture utility built with electrons.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.000]   So it's not small, it's a 400 megabyte download,
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.560]   but it's absolutely free.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.240]   It's called CAP and it works quite well,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:01.240]   delivering GIFs, MPEG-4, WebM or APNG with optional audio.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.720]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.640]   I think they've done a really nice job.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:11.640]   It's an open source project, so it's free
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:15.280]   and it sits on your tray in your menu,
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.680]   and you can open it up at any time
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.960]   and record your screen.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.000]   New screen capture, which I have to say,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.560]   it is very nicely done.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.480]   Integrates really well into Mac OS.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.640]   This is for Mac OS, I should point out, CAP.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:31.120]   And it's get kap.co if you wanna get it.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:35.560]   Oh, let's not forget, thank you ScooterX in our chat room.
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:38.000]   And this is one of those things, if you're listening live,
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.120]   it's gonna be great for you.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.640]   If you're listening right away, it's gonna be great for you,
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.240]   but it's no good tomorrow.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:45.840]   For this one day only, November, what is it, 26th,
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:49.480]   Pixelmator Photo for iPad is free, not five bucks,
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.160]   which is the earlier low price, free.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.760]   It's still not expensive, I don't know what it is now,
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:58.760]   20 bucks, but free today, so don't waste any time.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:03.640]   Pixelmator Photo is a really nice photo editing tool.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.320]   It's excellent. Yeah, I love it.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:08.240]   Everybody should have it, so get it, well, it's free.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.320]   We're out of time and we're out of material,
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.240]   so I think we should probably just go home.
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:15.800]   Renee Ritchie is at imore.com/vector.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.480]   Don't forget to watch that show on a religious basis.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.440]   That means while you're holding your prayer beads.
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:26.240]   But we also love having him here every Tuesday.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.000]   - He's so much Leo. - Andy and Naco,
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:28.920]   thank you for being here.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:32.840]   Andy is at WGBH at Boston and at anonco.com
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:35.600]   and on the Twitter, I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:36.640]   - Hey! - Thank you, Andrew.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.280]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:39.760]   - Gobble, gobble. - Don't people,
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.680]   I didn't say it to Renee,
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.040]   'cause he's already eaten his turkey.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.000]   He's already had his pre-chicken sandwich.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]   I'm gonna eat your turkey too.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.120]   I'm celebrating both of this year with me.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.600]   - Oh, I hate it.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.120]   - Oh, you Canadians have to do your holidays.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.600]   Just a little bit in front of ours.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.120]   I hate that.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.360]   Alex Lindsey, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.000]   - My in-laws are coming up
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.200]   and we're all gonna have turkey.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.320]   My mother-in-law is from Louisiana and she knows how to.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.320]   - Oh! - Oh!
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.520]   - So why don't we still have a cage
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.360]   and start batching right now?
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.200]   - Now I- - Now I-
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.040]   - Now I- - I'm gonna start prepping for-
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.280]   - This year a little darker than you usually are.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.600]   So I'm thinking you've been in tropical climbs.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.520]   - I was in Cambodia and India.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.840]   - Oh, in India too.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.520]   So I was in-
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:19.520]   - Both for gigs obviously.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.440]   - Yeah, so you weren't escaping the law or anything.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.880]   (laughing)
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:27.000]   - No, I was working on a little AR project in Cambodia
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.560]   and then in Bangalore doing some work
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.560]   and then up in Dharmasala.
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:32.400]   - Fun. - India.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.840]   So I spent, yeah, a lot of time walking around.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.160]   - Well, we missed you, but I'm glad we're gonna have you
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.160]   back here for a few weeks.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.880]   - Yeah, if you'll see you next week.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.120]   Dave Hamilton, we love having you on Mac Observer.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.160]   I don't know when you're gonna be back
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.840]   because Lori Gills back and Alex are back,
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:47.880]   but thank you so much for being here
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.760]   last couple of weeks, Macobserver.com, Mackekekecab.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.760]   Do you have a hard time saying it too?
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.880]   - I used to, but now I can say Mackekecab
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:56.880]   without any trouble at all.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:59.080]   - Mackekecab, yeah, there you go.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.160]   - Mackekecab, yeah, I'll just practice.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.560]   - Thanks for having me and honor to be here
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.400]   with the OG crew.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.520]   It really, it's awesome.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:04.360]   - Oh, we always love it.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.480]   - Nice to have you. - Nice to have you.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.560]   - Great contribution to the show.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.160]   And I think I've covered everybody.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.680]   He's here, yes.
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.360]   Did I miss anybody?
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.840]   Nope, thank you.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:15.960]   Oh, I forgot you.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.240]   Thank you for being here.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.720]   I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:21.600]   if you celebrate this week with loved ones
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.200]   or as Andy says with people you don't like.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.080]   It doesn't matter.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.280]   Or just by yourself.
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:27.320]   - Everybody's equal on Black Friday.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.800]   - Everybody's equal on Black Friday.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.320]   Yeah, good luck on Black Friday.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.400]   Yeah, we do Mac break weekly every Tuesday about,
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.160]   well, it varies at around 11, 11,
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.800]   between 11 and noon, Pacific time.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:43.800]   That would be between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.720]   That would be about 1900 to 2000 UTC.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.560]   Here's the deal.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.120]   We have iOS today before that.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.120]   So if you tune in anytime on Tuesday,
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.160]   twit.tv/live, you're sure to get some great Apple content.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.400]   Twit.tv/live for audio or video live streams.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.680]   If you're watching the live streams,

[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.000]   A great bunch of people in there.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.560]   We also have on demand versions available on our website,
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.320]   twit.tv/mbw.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.800]   Even information on how to subscribe
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.600]   and I always like it if you subscribe
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:16.920]   'cause not only will you get the show
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.400]   the minute it's available,
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.520]   but you'll also send a little signal to the platform,
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.960]   whatever podcast tool you use
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.920]   that we're an important podcast still
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.120]   and that helps us get the word out.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.960]   So please subscribe.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.720]   That's a great thing to do.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.360]   If you're not a live watcher,
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.680]   you might want to visit our community, twit.community.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.400]   It's a great forum where people
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.360]   who watch the show asynchronously gather to talk
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.480]   and there's always some great conversations
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:46.280]   in their twit.community.
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:47.600]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.600]   Now I have to say, sorry.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.040]   It's time to get back to work because,
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:54.840]   as we've been saying for the last 15 years,
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.240]   break time is over.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.080]   Bye bye.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.980]   (upbeat music)
