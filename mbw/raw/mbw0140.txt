[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   From Screencast's online, Don McAllister, out here from the UK.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It's nice to have you, Don.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Great to be here.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   What a pleasure it is to actually come here to the cottage after all this time.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So you've never been in the cottage?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   You've been on the show many a time.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   You've been on the show, but this is the first time in the flesh as it were.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Oh, I'm so glad to have you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Well, great.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   A regular's here in the cottage, of course, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Corpse.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Hello.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Hello.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Do you hate what people call it, the Pixel Corpse?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I think of a dead pixel one because it's a dead pixel.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   What is a dead pixel?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Look, every time someone says it, I go, I just think of this little dead pixel one.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I have a dead pixel.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Erospa.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I have a dead pixel.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Also, here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I don't know who brought the dice transition, but it must be Andy Enocho.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Welcome to a 1987 video music show.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Andy Enocho.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I forgot Alex.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I forgot to play your...
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Now the whole gang is so much better now.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And it's time to talk about all things Apple.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We're getting closer and closer to the Worldwide Developers Conference, of course, and the drumbeats
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   are coming in.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You start the traditional rumor mill from China is ramping up.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.240]   We're seeing some rumors about the next iPhone, which even if they weren't a rumor, it seemed
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   like, yeah, okay.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.600]   It'll obviously, it'll have a compass in it.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.080]   I'm sorry, magnetic, what do they call it?
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.600]   Magnetic range finding, something like that.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   Just like the T-Mobile G1, right?
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   It'll know stuff.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   Well, and you can use that with Google Maps Street View on the G1 on the Android.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840]   You rotate the phone and it kind of knows and it's pointing.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   Yeah, so that's kind of cool.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.280]   It's also really handy for turn-by-turn directions software.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.080]   Usually as anybody who's used GPS knows, it doesn't know what direction you're facing
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   until you drive a little bit.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   And then you realize that you should have taken a ride instead of a left.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.280]   And you really do not want to bridge the coast for three miles.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.720]   It can really be.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.200]   Lovely, California coastline.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Oh, well.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600]   Really be frustrating.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.560]   This will also have, according to the rumor, a 600 megahertz processor.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.040]   That's a 50% increase in speed.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   That would be a good thing.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.640]   Although I never felt like the iPhone wasn't speedy, but I'm sure game developers will
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   love the additional speed.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.280]   Yeah, I'm sure the people just push it harder.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.120]   Let me see what else we have in this rumor.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.920]   An FM radio?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   Anybody buy that?
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   Unlikely.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.800]   Now, some kind of broadcasting to it, I think might be doable.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.400]   FM transmitter, maybe?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.600]   No, definitely not.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.080]   That's most likely against the FCC wouldn't let you put that on the phone.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.920]   I don't see any reason to put a radio in there.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   No, I just think that there's a lot of digital broadcasting that people are looking at for
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.160]   both TV and radio to cell phones and everything else, but they're not going to use FM to
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   do that.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.640]   They're going to use a digital signal to do that.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.800]   I think that's more likely what's going to go on there.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   It seems pretty unlikely.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.080]   Even serious is starting to tank now.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Satellite radio.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   There's just no way to make money there.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.680]   Internet radio is where it's at.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   Your phone can do it.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.800]   Your phone can do it really well.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.960]   Many people who listen to the show listen on their phone.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.120]   It just doesn't seem credible.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.800]   32 gigs of storage.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   That's credible.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Yes.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.960]   Yeah, it's got to be a big bump in storage, I think.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.120]   I think that's a given thing.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   They've got a 32 gig.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   I touch.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   Why not have a 32 gig iPhone?
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.680]   Here's the one I like.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.280]   And I hope this is true.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   3.2 megapixel camera, much needed on the iPhone.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.400]   It really is a laggard in terms of camera.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.640]   And autofocus, like also in the G1.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   Autofocus.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   Well, now that's an important feature in the G1 because it lets you focus on barcodes,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.600]   among other things.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.480]   But it also means that the times when you drop your phone and you think, "Oh, thank
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   God, nothing happened."
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Now there's a very tricky, tiny mechanical device in there that now, if one gear shares
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.000]   off or gets misaligned, now you've lost your camera.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.280]   That's a good point.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   That's a very good point.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.720]   I do have a little crack in my screen when I needed to drop it.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.160]   Well, I had to drop my phone like five or six times before any damage of any kind occurred.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.120]   I was just realizing that, you know, Justine Azaric used to count how many times she dropped
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   her phone.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.360]   And we were in the studio last week and she doesn't even count anyway.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   She throws it on the ground.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   She just has to be done with it.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360]   She's kind of throws it over.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's not even like...
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.600]   Because she feels it will never break.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.960]   I guess you got to point...
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.280]   Now it was carpet and everything.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   But it was funny.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   She was like, "Oh, I don't need this anymore."
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   And she's kind of just tossed it over the ground.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   And I was like, "So we count that?"
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.840]   And she's like, "Oh, I don't count those anymore."
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.680]   That's a very WWF maneuver.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   Cheers.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.440]   But that's always assuming that the user...
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   Yes!
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   That's always assuming the user's traditional...
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   Break, folk off!
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   Break, folk off!
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   It's always assuming that they use a traditional focusing mechanism though.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   You never know they might come up with a special, fancy trick to actually do the focusing.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.400]   I just hope they have a macro mode so you can actually zoom...
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.880]   It's just standard auto focus but a macro mode so you can actually zoom in and actually
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.120]   read barcodes really well.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.360]   It's so cool.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.920]   I mean this is a really nice feature of the Android phone, the G1 from T-Mobile.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.600]   Do they have this in the UK in any form?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   You know, I don't think they do.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   I don't think they do.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   Here you can play with it.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   Oh, first time I've touched one.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   Be part of your visit.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Okay.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   I think I've crashed it.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.520]   We're waiting because the new cupcake firmware is supposed to come out like today.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   Okay.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   So I'm just waiting for it.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.280]   If you see an offer for updating the firmware, please say yes.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.440]   And by the way, don't hold it for too long.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   The battery will die.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Right.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.640]   Okay.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's only got about five minutes.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   No, it's better than that.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   It doesn't like to be touched.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   It's a very...
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Yeah, it doesn't like...
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   It's the first mobile phone with Asperger's.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.800]   You can hold onto it.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.240]   Sorry, you don't have just teasing you.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.200]   Apple has tracked the top five PC makers in the UK for the first time.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.400]   That's good news.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   And it's especially in light of the fact that Apple shipments, Mac shipments are at an 18
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.520]   month low, but everybody else is doing badly, I guess.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   So that's the...
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.160]   Well, they're doing a really big push, I think, outside of the US territories because that's...
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.360]   I think that's the area where they can grow significantly because they haven't traditionally
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   been big in those markets.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   Yeah, it's traditionally...
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   I know in the UK...
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   I know in the UK it's really taken off the past two or three years.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.280]   I mean, I think we're up to about 15 or 16 Apple stores now from...
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   Wow, that's a lot.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.120]   And there's more coming as well that they really are investing in the overseas territory.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.720]   It's true when you go to Europe, when you go to Asia, you don't see a lot of Macintashes.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.360]   I don't know about the UK.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's funny.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.480]   I'm relatively new switch here, which surprises a lot of people.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.280]   I've been using the Mac for about four years.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.320]   And before that, I'd actually never...
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.080]   In my corporate IT guys, when I used to work in corporate IT, I can't remember a single
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.880]   instance of actually seeing a Mac in the corporate environment at all, you know, any
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.680]   meetings, no Mac laptops at all.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.320]   In fact, the only time I saw Macs was probably 10 or 15 years ago when I actually installed
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.720]   a suite for our graphics department when I worked for the government at that time.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.760]   But yeah, so the penetration has been fantastically significant into especially into the UK market.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.040]   Now let's put this on perspective.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.320]   143,000 units in the first quarter.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   I mean, it's not...
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.800]   It's not millions of Macs.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.040]   But it is a 4.8 market share, which is very significant.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.160]   And that's 6% growth over year over year.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.680]   In contrast to the 5.1 decrease in the overall PC market in the UK.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.080]   So everybody else has been going down and Apple's been going on.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   Yeah, well, surprise.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.200]   I said this before on another podcast, but there's a brand new retail development in
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.720]   Liverpool called Liverpool One.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.480]   And there's a brand new Apple store there.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.360]   And because it's great that it's local and that's actually popping and see what's going
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   on.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.160]   And every time I've been there, there's an Apple store and then 200 yards away, there's a
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.200]   Sony store as well, which is a really nice Sony store, all the TVs, Sony laptops.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.160]   Every single time I've walked past, because I walked past the Sony store on the way to
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.440]   the Apple store, I've perhaps seen one customer in every time I've passed walking past the
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   Sony store.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   You get to the Apple store and it's actually heaving.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   You know, it's just a shock plug.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.240]   It was that way in the state.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   We had a Sony store.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   Is this still there?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240]   In the...
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   It's gone.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   In the material?
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.360]   You understand, when you close the Sony style store in your own...
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   In the Sony mall.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.120]   Yeah, it's a metrian mall and they...
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.800]   I mean, I can't imagine they're very much rent.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.360]   I mean, it was there building and it's empty.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   That is stunning.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   It's amazing.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   But it was never very busy.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.840]   You have to wander through.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   Why not?
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.360]   I think Sony's really lost its brand.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.640]   I think there's a huge...
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.800]   I think there's a huge thing about Apple providing lots of services within their store that keep
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   it really churning.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.440]   The ability that people can come in, they can surf the web, which a lot of people kind
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.400]   of annoyingly do in my opinion.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   Because it wasn't there somebody who wrote a whole book in the Apple store.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.600]   I can't remember your name.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.960]   Well, but when you have the Genius bar, you have the studio guys do it, you know, the
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.000]   Super Genius, I don't know what they call it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.680]   But they do like little lessons, you have the theater.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   And I do...
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   I mean, I think the Apple...
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.640]   I mean, I understand what the smaller ones, but the theater I think is really useful.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.600]   And the theater is awesome in Tokyo.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.320]   The theater has its own floor.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   So it's like a completely separate little thing and people are coming in for classes
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.760]   And so anyway, it's...
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   I think that they're really...
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.920]   I think Apple does a much better culture using the brick and mortar as a place for the
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.000]   culture to go.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.800]   It's still a little...
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.760]   I would love it to be a little bit more culture oriented, but it's more than anything else
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   we've seen.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.920]   That's why they're selling more.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.040]   I believe I saw a number and I have to look for it here.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.440]   They're doing better selling more...
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.640]   Doing more revenue per square foot than any other retail outlet in the country.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   Holy cow.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   At least they were in the fall.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.080]   And you think it's service?
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   I think it is.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   I think it's the fact that they're providing services to their constituents as well as...
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   People can come in and look at stuff, but there's also...
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.640]   There's a lot of things you can go and ask questions.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.520]   A lot of people standing there in line, every time the Apple Store opens, and there's an
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.640]   Apple Store, 100 feet from our office, every time the Apple Store opens, there's 20 people
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   in line.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.360]   Now, why are they in line to get into the Apple Store at 10 o'clock in the morning?
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.800]   It's to go to the Genius Bar.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.680]   And so people are going into that and they're able to...
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   A lot of people are surfing the web by going in and using the computers.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   So it fills it up.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.040]   And I think that also when it feels full, it feels more successful too.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.640]   I think that's another kind of typical street issue.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.520]   Well, you've already defined it as a place...
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.440]   As part of what you get with a Mac.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.080]   If when a Windows machine dies or gets a little otsionia, you don't know instinctively, "Well,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   where should I take this?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.720]   I can be ripped off by these guys.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.960]   I could have these guys over here.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.000]   Take a look at my pictures on my hard drive without telling me about it."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.320]   When you buy a Macintosh, you instinctively know where the Apple Store is and where you're
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   going to go.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   So that's where the first place you go.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.720]   When you want to buy hardware, when you want to look at stuff, when you want to read
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   about something that's...
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.800]   When you've read about something that's really cool and really hot that you can't afford
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.920]   just now, but you hope to when you get your birthday money in three months' time.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   It's brilliant.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:12:00.240]   I try to convince myself that every time I want to buy something that I've got two very,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.680]   very beloved aunts who still send me checks for $20 every year.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   That was not huge.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.280]   But watch, but look at me.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   You know what?
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280]   I really want that $280 blue rate.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   You know what?
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.720]   I do have a $20 check that I have in cash in three months.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.680]   It's almost like I'm getting it for free.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.520]   It's my birthday money.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   It's my birthday money.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.000]   I'm both on Mother's Day.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   They're lovely, lovely ones.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.040]   I think that's what I'm going to say from now on when anybody says, "You spend too much
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   money on computers."
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   That's my birthday money.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.320]   How they provide birthday and Christmas money?
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   Well, I didn't...
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   Yeah, I put them together.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.040]   Here's some students who are making some little pocket changes.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.320]   A company in Chicago called Tapware, Sam Kaplan and Louis Harbo.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   They've got seed funding from University of Chicago, top business school professor.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.880]   They recently released their first iPhone application called Math the Math Master.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.280]   They're in seventh grade.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.040]   The Math Master, they're in seventh grade.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.520]   Yeah, just in case you're not feeling behind as an adult.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   99 cents.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.080]   Oh, I got a better one for you.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.240]   Here's a little Owen.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.600]   They don't give his last name because he's in fifth grade.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.840]   He wanted to learn how to code for the iPhone.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   He put together math time.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.480]   I guess these kids like math.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.840]   It's a flashcard program on the iPhone.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.720]   He says, "Thanks to my brother Finn for his help with the icons."
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   I wonder how...
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   And Finn is...
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.400]   Also 99 cents.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   This just shows you...
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   I don't know what it shows you.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.160]   It shows you kids are smarter than we were.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.760]   The thing is that the tools are so...
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   The tools are better.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   They should be teaching this.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.320]   I was learning basic at 10.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.760]   At 12, I was doing machine language and assembly language.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   There was no reason.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.480]   The thing is that...
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.480]   It was so much harder than it is now.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.160]   Schools should definitely be doing a lot more programs like this where kids are learning
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.520]   how to build their own pieces.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.160]   The reason I learned a program was because I was tired of rolling the dice for building
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.960]   non-player characters for Dungeons & Dragons.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.360]   So you wanted to write a dice program?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.760]   I wrote a basic program that built...
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   You know what's interesting?
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.120]   I don't think either one of these kids learned in school.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.440]   My sense is they learned on their own, you know?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.600]   But at least they had a little bit of help from the outside and cars from the outside.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   I mean, I learned...
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.480]   The only real encouragement that my school gave me to learn an assembly language was...
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   I figured out that if I wrote my own operating system for the Apple IIe, I could really annoy
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.400]   the hell out of all the teachers in the library and they never figured out how it worked.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.560]   This really should be like the next Apple commercial.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   The best response.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.280]   Microsoft had those commercials.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.600]   Hi, I'm six years old and I'm taking a picture and I'm smiling to somebody.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.760]   I'm six years old.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.960]   I use a Macintosh and I wrote the software that six year old used on Windows.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.320]   Now, that's a response.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.480]   That's a response.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   Have you...
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   Speaking of ads, let me...
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.560]   People worry about the...
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.760]   This is the new Microsoft ad.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.480]   It's a financial planner.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   What about the past?
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.920]   Wes Moss, certified financial planner.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.320]   So you know, he's got to be telling you this.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.800]   People worry about the capacity of their iPod.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.840]   What about the capacity of their bank account?
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.680]   And a buck a song, they'll run out of money way before they run out of space.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.920]   It costs $30,000 to fill the latest iPod using iTunes.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.560]   Oh, I don't know about you, but I don't have 30 grand laying around for music.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.040]   So if someone's using iTunes, I tell them to consider a subscription service like Zoom
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.120]   Pass unlimited music downloads for $14.99 a month.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.000]   One costs a lot and one costs a little.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.600]   All right.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.760]   That's all it's meant.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   I had a hard time coming with that 30 grand.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   Me, I'd say, three.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760]   So I'm in the whole...
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.280]   I could have had a house, but no, I have an iPod, an iPod touch and an iPhone.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.280]   I'm just an idiot.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   I'm just an idiot.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.280]   Thanks for calling me up, Microsoft.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.200]   It costs you $30,000 to fill that iPod.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.120]   Well, they all mentioned that it's $15.99 a month for as long as you want to listen to
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   the music.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   You have to listen to the music for like eight years.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.680]   Oh, more you have to get the 30,000.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.120]   If you do the math, it's like...
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.000]   I think I do think that Apple should strongly consider a subscription hybrid where you could
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.160]   pay, you get, I don't care whether it's 96-bit or 128-bit or whatever, still DRM'd into
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.360]   the end of the end, and you can download as much as you want.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.400]   And when you want to buy something and keep it DRM-free, 256-bit, you pay for it, I think
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.520]   that Apple would do extremely well with that.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.280]   They would kill this entire conversation.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.480]   And to be honest with you, I think that they pretty much wipe out the music industry as
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.480]   we know it.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.280]   I mean, retail industry because there will be no reason not to...
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.200]   People will be insane to buy plastic after that.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.920]   I mean, I think with that, I watched it the first time, and I thought, "Actually, that's
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.080]   not a bad ad," because it does hit tone, really.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.800]   But then I watched it the second time, I thought, "Great, sign me up for a Zoom pass
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   for my iPod."
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.640]   Because it doesn't make the connection that you actually need a different music player.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.200]   So I'm sure it's going to confuse a lot of people who don't even know a Zoom exists.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.280]   I have to admit, I've really considered getting a Zoom just so that I could just fill it up
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.440]   with stuff and have this one player that I have wandered around with that I just chalked
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   full of stuff.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   That's what this one is.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.800]   That's what I randomly think, "Oh, I really want to make a mix of some crazy stuff for
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.120]   whatever this trip is."
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.000]   I bought the cheap little 4G Zoom.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Is that a Zoom?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Something else I've not seen before.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   We definitely don't know.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   We actually do get the G1s in the UK, by the way.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.160]   I've had some friends tell me we do, and some of them have actually already got cupcake,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.240]   but they still haven't extended the Zoom into the UK.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.280]   I'm sorry that we're piling on Microsoft so much, but doesn't a Zoom someone be fired
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.360]   that someone in this bizarre faraway little hamlet known as England has never seen one?
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.640]   I've never seen one.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   My first Zoom.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   This is a...
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.160]   You know, it's not charged up, so I better charge it up here.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.240]   Then you can really play with it.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   That's what I did.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.960]   I have a Zoom pass, 15 bucks a month, and they have some really neat features.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.640]   In fact, I hate to say it, but on the radio show this past week, and I told somebody to
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.920]   get a Zoom because they were looking for a subscription, and that's the solution.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.560]   It's not a bad solution.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.920]   Not only do you get unlimited music, but you get 10 free songs to keep every month.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.680]   Really, you're paying five bucks a month for the subscription, and you get 10 songs,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   if you would ever buy 10 songs.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.480]   For an existing iPod, it's not likely to make someone to give up their iPod to go across
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   the same thing.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   Exactly.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.120]   You have an iPod, just like Andy's, a media reaction will.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   I didn't spend $30,000.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   What are you nuts?
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.840]   And as Shubhi mentioned, you don't necessarily have to go to Zoom.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.480]   There's a whole bunch of different devices that will work.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   I like the ones from...
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   Rhapsody.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   Rhapsody works great.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.680]   As a matter of fact, if you go to their site, we'll show you a whole list of different
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.560]   players that are streaming players and pocket players.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.760]   I like the Sansa players from SanDisk.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.000]   I think they're less expensive than the Zoom.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.720]   They have more features.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.120]   SanDisk is a great manufacturer because they are just different in philosophy than Apple.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.840]   They basically say, "We've got this box the size of a deck of cards.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   How much crap can we possibly stick in there?
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   How many features can we add?"
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.680]   Because that's the only thing we have to compete against Apple with.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.200]   And then you realize, "Oh, it's got Wi-Fi.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.960]   It's got an FM transmitter, FM receiver, and it's got an AM receiver, and it's got this,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   that, and the other.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   It's got a card slot."
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.440]   Like, "Wow, that's actually kind of cool.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.960]   And it's half the price of an iPod."
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   How much is the Samsung?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.880]   The good ones start at about 90 bucks.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:29.160]   So easily for the price of a Nano, you'll get something that can play actual video and
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:35.320]   can swap memory cards between multiple devices and will play subscription music from Rhapsody.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.360]   It's not that much more expensive.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   And how much is Rhapsody?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.800]   Rhapsody, I think it's something like 15 bucks.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   I think it's the same.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   I mean, they couldn't--
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.920]   Yeah, I don't know off the top of my head, but they couldn't charge a whole lot more.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.680]   I was just trying to find the connector so I could charge this up.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   You could tell off how often I use this.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.000]   I can't find the connector.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It's here somewhere.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.600]   But, no, I'm with you, Andy.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.960]   Actually, I probably should have told that woman the Sansa.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.240]   Although, I think the Zoom UI is really great.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.040]   I really am a fan of the Zoom UI.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.480]   Yeah, I think that, as I said, I think that Apple is missing the boat here.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.400]   I think that they could definitely-- I think they could make them something that wouldn't
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.760]   conflict with what they already have.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.440]   I think it would make the music business, you know, the RIA, or whatever, happier because
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.400]   they want subscription models.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.480]   And this hybrid of letting people buy what they want.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.760]   So why is Apple not doing it?
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   Is it a steal job?
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   They think it's not a market.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.360]   They think it's not a market, but the thing is that that's the only open-- that's the
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   only chink in their armor.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.240]   Is this subscription service?
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.720]   If they-- all they have to do is just close the chink.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.440]   Wouldn't it be ironic?
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.080]   Would it be ironic if this ad prompted Apple to say, OK, fine.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   It will do it.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   It will do it.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   It will do it.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080]   It will do it.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   Well, that's what they're waiting for until they actually have to do it because they
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   haven't had to do in the past because there's no other competitors that are doing the similar
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.640]   business, but now there are, and people are attracted to that and they can gauge the
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.120]   feeling within the marketplace that they might actually go for.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   No, I like subscription.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.760]   I think it's a really nice model, frankly.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:01.040]   I thought that the ad about the woman who wants to edit video was far more absurd.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   That's ridiculous.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   I feel sorry.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   I think we talked about that last week.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   I think we talked about that last week.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   That's just ridiculous.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.520]   I hadn't seen it when we had talked about it.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.480]   And I finally saw it last night and I was like, what are they talking-- oh, it only has
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.080]   two gigs, so I can't edit anything.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.600]   Like, she's really going to-- two gigs of RAM for the same price.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.320]   And I was just kind of like, and what are you going to edit with your little PC?
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.000]   You're really going to put HD in there, right?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And also, what are you going to edit with as well because they didn't touch on the software
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.760]   that would actually run on that.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.640]   Should I play the Sheila finds her perfect laptop ads as we play in?
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.400]   We play the other Microsoft.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   I'm an artist.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   We play the other Microsoft demo.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   I use these things.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.280]   You might as well give Microsoft the hat trick here.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   I'm an artist.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.720]   Of course, Microsoft cites a lot.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   There we go.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   Plus, she wanted a laptop with-- a fast processor, big screen, and I really need something that's
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.480]   going to be able to cut video.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   For under $1000.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   Sorry.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.000]   If we told her, you find it, you'll keep it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Let's go.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I'm open to any brand.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.680]   I'm a filmmaker, so I want something that's going to be powerful.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.080]   This is going to be a fast processor.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.280]   For video editing, that's going to help you a lot.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.040]   That's going to help you a lot.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.540]   This is the best Apple.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.720]   It only has two gigabytes of RAM.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.600]   Having it be portable is super important.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.000]   Firewire, webcam, a USB.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Cool.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Cool.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   This is even bigger screen, if possible.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Want something a little smaller.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Oh, look.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.880]   Is this graphics card going to be powerful?
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   Wow.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   Definitely.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   Definitely power.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   He's dazzling us with a technical know-how.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   He's just screwing.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.800]   Look, they've got Microsoft Office here for her, and they didn't mention the fact that
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.560]   she'll have to pay a little extra for that.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.160]   Hey, guess what I'm holding?
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.360]   Money laptop.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.840]   Ha ha.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.200]   She bought it at Fry's.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   It looks like a lot.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   I'm going to see you and an artist.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   He's going.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   I'm a PC and I'm an artist.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.040]   I don't do any modern, but it has to be a HD because that's what we've had in the past
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   three adverts.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   They've all been HD.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   That's right.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   Weird.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.560]   I think there's a little money going and trading hands there from HP to Microsoft.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.960]   These may be really HP ads.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.760]   So you think she's made the wrong choice there, Alex Lindsay?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   Mr. Video Editor.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   I'm a video.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   She's a filmmaker, though.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.200]   Every time I hear someone talk about the fact that they're doing video editing on Windows,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.080]   I'm just kind of like, there are reasons that when you say you're doing some scientific
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.680]   stuff that you want to try, that there's only this app that runs on Windows or you're
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.720]   building some kind of new fangled computer or you like to tweak things and get under
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.760]   the hood, I get some of that.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.240]   It's not that I always say, "If you want a game, buy a PC."
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.560]   Yeah, if you want to do gaming, you should get a PC.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.520]   But when people say, "I want to do editing with video," I...
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   It's the back of my head.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   I try to go...
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.840]   So in front, what comes out of my mouth is, "How's that working for you?"
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.240]   And what goes in the back of my head is, "You're effing crazy."
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.040]   You know, so if Sheila's smart, she'll go to a back alley.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.480]   She'll sell that HP for the $300 worth and put it towards a Mac.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.240]   There's only a hundred bucks to put another two gigs of RAM in that laptop.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   She was so close.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.440]   Sheila, you were so close.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.520]   She's buying a PC to do video editing.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.440]   She's not doing anything serious with it.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.560]   So the thing is, is that two gigs is probably fine for Windows Movie Maker.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   It's plenty.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   Yeah, the thing that cracks me up with that advert, though, is when she has the guys,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   the graphics chip powerfully enough.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And it sort of looks like, "Yeah."
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   The number of times I've seen salesmen do that one.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   They're talking about it.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   They don't work for you.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   The same thing.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   That'll work.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   That'll work.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.420]   Now, if you're willing to spend some more money, you can get a video editing system out of
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   a PC.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.420]   And you buy, you know, some high-end buy-ev.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.200]   If you're not sitting there at $2000, you can get Avid Media Composer, or you can get
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.520]   Premiere, which is, you know, the Adobe production suite is really, really good.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.240]   But that costs as much as the computer she's talking about.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.500]   So I'm not saying that you can't do high-end work on a PC.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   I'm just saying that at the price point that she's talking about, she should have bought
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   a Mac.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   There is nothing that's going to solve her problem.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   Get a good idea.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.600]   Well, iMovie on a Mac would have been a good choice for her.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.200]   Or Final Cut Express on a Mac.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   Yeah, which is another 400 bucks, but still.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   Anyway, I don't, you know.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.500]   Anyway, I just, it, as I said, the Zoom one, I'm saying, that was compelling.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.000]   I'm like, "Well, you know, that's compelling."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.400]   And it's something that I think about a lot.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.000]   But that one was just absurd.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.320]   Eric Schmidt says, "Even if the FTC is investigating us, I am not going to resign from the Apple
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   Board.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.280]   FTC is investigating, as we mentioned last week, Google and Apple for conflict of interest
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.680]   because of interlocking directorships.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.440]   Investigation does not mean a fault-finding of any kind.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   They're just looking at it."
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.960]   So now, if the directors run off and start their own company, does that make them an
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   interloping?
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   Right.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.520]   Interloping, interloping.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.880]   He says, he doesn't see what the big deal is speaking to reporters before Google's annual
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   shareholder meeting.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.440]   Schmidt said he had no plans to step down from Apple's board, predicted the government's
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.080]   probe wouldn't find anything wrong.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.480]   And he says, "This is, you know, a tempest in a teapot.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.920]   Does not violate the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914."
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.200]   You have antitrust laws in the UK, don't you?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.120]   Are they more severe or less severe than here?
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.240]   Couldn't really say to be honest, but we do have the anti-competitive laws and such
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   a trip.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.680]   And I think it's a particular instance, I can't really see what the fuss is about because
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   they're in different market spaces.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Well, that's the issue.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.920]   If they were competing companies, then it shouldn't have because of potential for collusion.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.320]   Of course, I have to think your consumer protections are stronger because it was in the UK, the
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.080]   Apple ad, the number of Apple ads were banned.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   That's right.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   Yeah, they actually removed some.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.320]   It was over the, yeah, the internet, the whole internet in your pocket with the iPhone,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.200]   whereas you can't get flashed and stuff like that.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   Right.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   So it's not the whole internet.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   Yeah, there were some complaints.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.000]   But again, I think there were only 50 or 60 complaints about it, but it was enough to
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.480]   actually have that advert removed and taken down.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.280]   Speaking of iPhones, it looks like we've got a date for the Palm pre and we'll fight for
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   it.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.160]   In fact, it looks like it is going to be in fact June 7th.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160]   Don't forget us.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   Don't forget us.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   Which is, was that one or two days before?
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   Yes, the day before.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160]   The day before.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   Unbelievable.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.600]   They're trying to get everyone to, I believe, they're trying to get everyone to compare
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.680]   them to the iPhone the next day, which is a dangerous game to play, in my opinion.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.760]   Or they just feel like there'll be so much noise about the iPhone that they might, they
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760]   better get it in.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.120]   Of course, they could get it in now.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.640]   Yeah, they would be better off.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.400]   I think to do it a week or two before before people know what the iPhone is going to be.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.920]   And go ahead, Annie.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.120]   I was just going to say that all these news outlets are going to are going to want to
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.360]   be doing iPhone stories the week before the launch because there's all this build up.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.520]   And this all just realized that one of the great services that you do as an Apple fan
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.080]   is when Apple comes up with something brand new, line up outside of buildings in colorful
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.680]   garb and be excited about it.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.000]   Because, well, because, I mean, it's one thing to say, well, we're moving to a true 64-bit
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   operating system.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.280]   And with their new sun-based files distribution structure and the new blah, blah, blah, that
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.320]   really doesn't get camera attention.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.000]   But the way to get your way into the mass media is give them a nice visual that they
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   can tag a story on to.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.680]   And there's going to be lots of stories about maybe Steve Jobs coming back and giving the
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.400]   keynote, maybe a new iPhone.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.960]   They're going to want an excuse to have more video out there.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.880]   And so this is a very, very shrewd move by Palm to say they're going to need to fill
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.480]   90 seconds or two minutes.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.600]   They're going to want to button it with something and they're going to use it either the Palm
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.440]   story, either lead off their iPhone story or close their iPhone story.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   Excuse me, their iPhone story.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.920]   I don't think they have much chance of getting a lot of attention after the iPhone is released.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.800]   Because, you know, all they're hoping is to get that first X percent of people to just
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.160]   go out and buy the Palm to hopefully set up that toehold that'll give them that initial
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   about a credibility.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.720]   Well, I think that in some ways that this gets into this, there are people who are just anti
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.000]   iPhone, they're anti Apple, anti iPhone, they're anti those types of things.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.120]   And so they're going to see all this press about the iPhone.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.680]   And then when it gets when it gets bookmarked with the pre, they'll go, oh, I'm going to
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.080]   get that because it's not the iPhone and it's pretty cool.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   And it still has the thing.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.640]   I think that's what they're hoping for is because I don't think they're wanting to go
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.720]   head to head with people who are most likely to get an iPhone.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   I don't think they're going to.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:52.040]   I think I think with this first release, they can't have a realistic goal of stealing
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.640]   customers away from the iPhone.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.960]   I think that all they want to do is establish that credibility.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   Do do sort of like what Google did with the Google phone, establish we have a unique identity.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.720]   We have a unique reason for being here.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.360]   We think that there are some people out there who don't really want an iPhone that wants
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.440]   something that has the best things of the iPhone, but with a lot of different things
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   besides.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.000]   So again, so long as they they get out of the gate fast enough that they can still be around
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.120]   a year from now, that's how Palm judges this as a win.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.400]   I think that's what their strategy is right now.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:27.200]   According to the rumors and electronista, there'll be a big ad in the Wall Street Journal
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   on May 19th.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.520]   And that's when they'll announce the date.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   So we'll know in a week, we'll be able to talk about it next week.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.960]   We'll know in a week whether that date June 7th is true or not.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   And we may even know more.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.720]   We may know pricing and so forth.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's got to be under 200 bucks or 200 at most.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Can't be more.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.040]   There are no win situation really though, aren't they?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.800]   Because if they go two months before, they're going to have people waiting to see what happens
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   in the summer with the night.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   It's true.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.840]   They do it the day before they're going to get steamrolled by all the press coverage.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.640]   They do it two months after it might just get lost in the noise.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.960]   Basically, you're competing against a very, very successful phone.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.240]   And not just one really, you're also competing against the Blackberry, which is more and
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.440]   more successful all the time.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.560]   That's two tough phones to kind of come in at a nowhere and say, hey, we're back.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.360]   They're going to have to run some ads like the there's an app for that.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Right.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   I watch those ads.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   Those are great.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   That's as good as the Mac break picks sometimes.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.760]   I'm like, where did that app come from?
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   You know, like there's that for that.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   I'm like dude.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.000]   And then I was like, I literally now when I see the Apple ad come by for there's an
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   app for that.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   You watch.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.360]   I stop and I play it and I buy and then I play it and then I buy and I go, okay, then
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   I let it go.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.600]   Not only that, but I'm freeze framing it and looking at the other icons that they haven't
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   launched.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   See what else they've got.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   But it's always like, dude, there's no way there's an app for that.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.120]   Wow.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   Right.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   No, I think that's a great thing for developers too.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.280]   I mean, this is Apple's way of saying, hey, yeah, we take 30%, but you're getting a national
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.600]   TV ad some of you.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.560]   You know, and you might win that crapshoot.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.720]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   That's a pretty good.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.320]   Full page ad in one of the papers I was reading over at this one morning while I was over
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   here and it was every single app on the screen was to do with finance or, you know, the current
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   climate.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.240]   And there was only one app that actually heard of before and that was loan shark.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.480]   Everything else was brand new and I thought, I have to check those out.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Isn't that neat?
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   I think that's why I say we're working on it.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   Justine, Ezra is going to work with us on that.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   We did just kind of over the shoulders.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   We really close up with a second camera.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   I think it's pretty good shots with this camera.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   It actually looks pretty good when we were working on it.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   I think though that we're still trying to figure out the way we wanted to look.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   We've just done some tests and we want to talk about not just the apps, but also accessories.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   We're close to the surface.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   We finally got Justine into the office.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   We're shooting some stuff last week.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   Hopefully in June we'll have some time.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   There are a couple of iPhone stories here.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   One, the sling player.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Long awaited application for the iPhone is supposedly about to come out any minute now,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   May 12th or 13th.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   It will be, I'm sorry to say, $30, which seems like a little bit of a pricey.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   I think we're starting to see this escalation.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   I'm seeing more and more applications that are $20 or $30.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   Then there were, I think people are getting a little bit more aggressive about that.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   They'll probably get it.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.480]   Sling fans are crazy.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   I mean, they'll probably get it.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   Another drawback.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   Wi-Fi only, not no 3G support.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   This is probably something Apple insisted on or AT&T insisted on due to bandwidth issues.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   That's why the $30 is a really weird price.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   I'm sure they chose that price when they thought that they were going to have access to the 3G network
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   because access to my sling box, all the DVR content, and every channel on my cable box,
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   wherever I am, as long as I have my iPhone, that's worth $30 to me.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   I'm not sure if it's worth $30 if it's conditional upon my proximity to Wi-Fi.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   It's a little disappointing.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   Other apps, other phones allow it.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   I've used it.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   It's a great app.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   I mean.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   You've used the iPhone one?
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   I've used the iPhone one.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   It's very, very slick, very, very fluid.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   They didn't just take the BlackBerry version and somehow port it over.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   Not only that, but it's a really great TV tuner type of app.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   It's very easy to just have a little deck of the logos of all of your favorite networks
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   and all your favorite channels.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.480]   Just tap on a logo and suddenly you're watching Comedy Central Live.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.480]   It keeps up with you.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   I was using it on the 3G network and it was working just fine.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   Actually, it was a couple months ago.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   I have to check my notes.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   I believe I was working using it on the 3G network.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   In any event, it was a nice, fluid, smooth video.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   I was very impressed.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   I was very well thought out, very iPhone-like app if you follow.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   So sometime in the next 24 hours, you should be able to download it if you're a sling.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   Obviously, you have to have a sling box on your home system or this is doing good or know somebody
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   who was willing to give you their sling box passcode.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   But I'm just thinking, on other phones, will it use the 3G network or is it always Wi-Fi?
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   On the Windows mobile, will it use the 3G network?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.480]   I know it uses 3G on the BlackBerry.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   I haven't used it on AT&T network, so maybe this is just a specific carrier problem,
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   but I've used it on other networks and on the BlackBerry, at least.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   And the mobile edition has no restrictions on it.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.480]   And if you don't have an iPhone and you would like to get an iPhone,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.480]   maybe the key for you is to take a journalism degree.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   The University of Missouri or Mizzou Journalism School says they are going to require an iPod
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   Touch or an iPhone for all incoming journalism students.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   The associate dean of the J. School says there's been research that shows if students
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   hear the lecture a second time, they retain three times as much.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   So they're going to say, "We're going to give you a lecture on an iPod Touch or an iPhone
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   and you can review it."
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   I thought the interesting thing about that article was the, I think somewhere in there,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   I don't have it right in front of me, he said that lectures are one of the worst ways to...
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.480]   Lectures are the worst possible learning format.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.480]   The dean says, "Okay, here's what I was left with when I saw that."
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   Why are you giving them that?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   What is the story?
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   If they're the worst format, let's rethink this.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   You know, we are in the 21st century, let's stop lecturing and...
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   Maybe there's something else.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   Well, I think we've talked about this before.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   I just think that they should be taking a lot of EDU money.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   And instead of having lots of lectures, let's have the best people in the world that know this really well
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   create great videos and let people watch something at Ken Burns level or better yet at Star Wars level.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   Because there's enough money in that...
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   There's ways to do it better.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   There's a lot ways to do it better than have everybody reinventing the wheel.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   And this is in high school, this is in college.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   I'm with you.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   And then talking about having an iPhone at home really becomes useful,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   where you can watch a lot of this video, watch a lot of these things,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   and have them be much more interesting.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   This is fine.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.480]   I mean, this is a great step forward.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   But, you know, lectures are a great way to learn how to sketch, in my opinion.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   I mean, I did some work with some universities in the UK,
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.480]   and some of those had started to adopt using not so much the iPhone or the iPod touch,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   but, you know, just having summary information on lectures that had been given previously.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   So rather than expecting students to listen to a whole lecture again,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   because that's facing...
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   Not many people are actually going to sit down and listen to a 45-minute lecture twice through.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   But really just to reinforce the messages that we'll put across in the lecture.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   So some re-notes at the end that they could actually subscribe to and download and have at hand
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   so that if they wanted to refresh, they know what they'd actually...
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   The one nice thing about getting the lecture recorded is you can listen to it 2X.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   Sure.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   So I listen to a lot of things.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   I listen to a lot of people's screencast.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   And I listen to...
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   So I can usually comprehend it about 1.5 to 2X.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   That's right.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   They say that you actually understand better.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   They also say it's not really required.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   We just say that so that people will get one.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   No, no, no.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   It's required because by saying it's required, people can use their federal funding or their loans to buy it.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   You can include the cost and the aid.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   That's why they say it's required.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   They say you're not going to get in trouble if you don't have it,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   but by saying it's required, it allows you to use it for funding.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   That's the reason that they do that.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   God it.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   Because the nice thing is as well is that you've got all the enhanced functionality of enhanced podcasts and stuff like that.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   To have a single platform that everyone has makes it so much easier to actually manage and administer what content you're actually delivering for students.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   I think it's a great idea if they really use it.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   And I think that beyond listening to lectures, I think that once you have all these iPhones on a Wi-Fi network in a classroom,
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   there's a lot of interesting things that you could be doing.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   You could be setting up where the teacher's asking a question and everyone has to answer and it says,
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   "Okay, 33% were right.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   63% were wrong.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   4% didn't even hit their iPhone."
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   But you now have something that you can do these little spot checks where people can do those little tests or classes.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   But not tests like we're going to grade you on this, but everyone can interact rather than someone raising their hand.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   So you can give people multiple choices.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   You can have people put stuff in.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   That kind of thing I think would be very interesting as well.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   We're going to get to our picks of the week in just a second.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   Any other big stories anybody would like to bring up?
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   There are a ton of stories.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   Amazon has launched an iPhone optimized Kindle store for your iPhone Kindle app.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   I went through it.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   You like it?
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   Well, so I hadn't.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   Okay, let's do these quick.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   So we're going to run through a bunch of them.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   So like your one line.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   My one line is, "I don't read books that way."
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Okay.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   Like the Kindle, that's what I really realize is that linear format doesn't really work because I just open books and go through
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   them in little bits.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   So that, I found that was it.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   Leopard API has been finalized.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   Now you guys are giving me a hard time because I said, "Well, maybe Leopard will come out at WWDC."
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   And everybody said, "No way."
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   I still say no way.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   There's still much more to do with those and the optimization and stuff like that.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   Just because all they're saying now is that developers can start developing their apps knowing that they're not getting any more functions.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   We won't add any more functions.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   We're talking about that.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   So that I think needs to happen months before they release the app to the public.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   I think didn't they mess that up with Leopard in that they actually delivered a version of Leopard that was one build later on from the last build
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.480]   that the developers had and it caused a lot of applications to break.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   So they probably learned from that now.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   Now that they've said that now they had to say that before WWDC.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   That was the requirement.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   But I think that we're still looking at probably two more months before they...
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   Two more months isn't bad.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   I could take that.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   So you think August...
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   July.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   Somewhere between July, September, you know, that kind of range.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   Okay.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   I can live with that.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   One more story.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   Apple rejects a iPhone BitTorrent app saying this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   I think they had a one word press release.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   Duh.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   Duh.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   Just not.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   No.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   And Trent Reznor's back in the app store.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   We talked a lot about the fact...
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   Evidently after we talked about it, the pressure became excruciating.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   I'm not going to take any credit on that one.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.480]   It was common sense.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   I think mostly it was after Reznor talked about it.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   Yes.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   Reznor was...
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   His comments were fairly straight into the point.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   Straight into the point.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   There is a good way to describe it.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.480]   He wasn't too happy.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   So the Apple said, "Oh, well."
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   Okay.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   They did reject the "so you think you're holy," right?
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   Yes.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   That's the one where you could put your face on Jesus' face.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.480]   They said, "No, we don't like that."
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   We're not going to allow that.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   Same guy does animalizer, which lets you put your face on an animal's face.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   Apparently that's okay.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   Peace, Geality.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   Peace, Geality.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   Okay.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   If that's how you're going to be.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   All right.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   We're going to take a break and come back with your picks of the week.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   Great software or hardware or something you're going to want to buy.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   So get your checkbook, your pink slip, and bring the wife.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   Or if you are a wife, bring your husband.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   And our picks are coming up in just a bit, but right now it's time to talk about our friends at audible.comaudible.com
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.080]   slash Mac break.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.800]   That's the place to go to sign up for your audible subscription.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   You get a gold account.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   You get a free book.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.440]   Doesn't, I don't think it accounts for everybody in the world.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.840]   I don't know if this works in the UK.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   I'm sorry, Don.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.760]   I know you're an audible fan though, aren't you?
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.400]   If I was flying a big old jet airliner all the way to Heathrow Airport this afternoon as
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:06.760]   you are, I would have a loaded iPod loaded with great books from the iTunes store.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.400]   By the way, if you put it on your iPod, you can listen at double speed like Alex Lindsey
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.760]   likes to and read twice as many books in half the time.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   Or something.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   It's smarter than that.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   Faster.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.480]   Andy Enaco, what are you listening to these days, Honorable?
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.880]   Well, the latest book that I downloaded was the only book, unfortunately, that's available
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:33.920]   on audio from a fantastic neuroscience neurosurgeon and author Leonard Schlane.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.760]   Oh, he just passed away.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.840]   Yesterday, after a long, long fight with brain cancer.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.440]   And he was a speaker at the Conference on World Affairs for years and years and years.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.000]   So I got a lot of time to not just hang out with him, but even better, just like just
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.360]   listen to him give his lectures.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:59.040]   And it's exactly the sort of musings on the connection between the physical hardware that
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.920]   makes all humans run and the decisions that they make and how those two interact to form
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.360]   society and our society's conventions.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.440]   And it was one of those, his lectures were always those sort of things where after seeing
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.320]   his lecture on my favorite book of his, The Alphabet and the Goddess, it just really screwed
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.120]   up my head for about four or five hours later on.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.360]   He will make these conjectures just as illustrations.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:32.240]   I'll say, well, you know, what you probably never thought about before is that up until
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.320]   the invention of the typewriter, everyone who wrote creatively wrote with just one hand.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.160]   Just there was a pen that was in your, that was in your dominant hand and you would write
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.800]   with that hand, like for hours and hours and hours and days and days and days.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.600]   And so because only one hemisphere of your brain controls that brain, that hand, you're
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.360]   basically electrically stimulated at one side of the brain abnormally just to get this
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.360]   thing written.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.200]   But then the typewriter came along and now you're writing with both hands and now both
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.840]   sides have to be actively controlling the process of writing.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   So how is that going to influence what is being written?
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.960]   How are the dynamics of how the brain works and how creativity works?
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.400]   And I was just like, what hand do I usually type with when I'm writing?
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.440]   Am I more clever when I type with my left hand than with my right hand?
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   And but it's also what I don't like about many of these types of books is that it's
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.160]   just the parapsychology, phony baloney, say, well, it's not that you like orange wallpaper.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.880]   It's that because evolutionarily speaking, you were bred to, it's like, well, no, you're
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   just guessing, aren't you?
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   Well, yes, I am.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.880]   But you still paint.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   I keep going.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:39.640]   It was just the most intense and interesting and intriguing notions that just again, force
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.800]   you to think of the human brain as a collection of features, a collection of software and
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.440]   everything that we do and everything that we say as being influenced by the machinery
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.520]   that we're limited to.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.840]   I'm very, very sad that he's gone, not only because he was just a terrific guy to hang
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.040]   out with, but also because, I mean, there's no more books coming out.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.440]   He's got about three or four, I think, that have come out.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.960]   Only one, unfortunately, is available on Audible.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:10.640]   And that's one of his earlier ones called sex time and power that makes him really,
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.280]   again, these really interesting things.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.880]   I said, well, where do our society's perception of time comes from, come from?
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.160]   As early hominids, how did we figure out that time is cyclical as well?
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.440]   Half of our population has something that happens about every 28 days.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.080]   Perhaps that includes the men that things tend to happen at a repeatable pattern.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.640]   That actually set up.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:39.600]   And once again, every so often, you will sort of lay the book down or just press pause
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   in your iPod.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.760]   I just think very, very interestingly and creatively for about 10 minutes.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.160]   I've listened to this.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.920]   Unfortunately, it's a bridge, but I immediately went out and bought the full book and I gave
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.840]   it to my daughter, who's fascinated by this kind of stuff.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.000]   I am so jealous, Andy, that you knew Leonard Schlane because he's actually a family friend.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.760]   He just lived down the road.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.360]   Well, my wife's best friend is his daughter.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.160]   Oh, so sad.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.360]   And so, and he...
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.920]   I would have loved to meet this guy.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:11.600]   He was just at a family, friends and family get togethers or whatever.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   He was just...
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.360]   The thing that's amazing about him is he really is...
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.160]   Some people write this stuff and it's all theoretical and it lives in their room and
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.400]   then there's somebody completely different when they're out in public or out or out just
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   with friends or whatever.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.120]   He just is an incredible thinker, an incredible person.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.960]   I mean, he was just always the thoughtfulness that he brought to stuff and someone who was
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:37.320]   really observing a lot of this stuff, ongoingly every moment, he was really living into that.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.880]   Now, he was a physician though, right?
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   His training was not in anthropology or...
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.000]   But he is the definition of a Renaissance man.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.400]   I mean, it was just the things that he was interested in and what he brought into it.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   It's a great loss.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.240]   This book is an excellent introduction to his works.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   Absolutely.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   I have, of course, all the other ones full-fledged.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.760]   And I hope I'll ask Audible to do more of these.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.320]   In fact, they've been asking me, "What would I like to read if I were going to read a book?
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   Maybe I'll pick a...
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.160]   What would be the next book you think that should be...
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.440]   I mean, first of all, they should have an unabridged version of this.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   But...
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.280]   And his latest book, which I haven't read, the thing is, is he would give me the books
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.360]   and go, "I know you don't read, but...
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   But here's...
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.360]   I remember chapters of books.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   I don't remember the names because I have them at the house because he would give them
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.080]   to me and say, "I know you're not going to read this, but I'm going to give it to you
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   anyway."
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.080]   You know, and what would you recommend, Annie?
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   Is there a book that I should read that they should add to this library?
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.440]   Because I'm going to send them a note saying, "I'll read it if you put it on the library."
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.800]   I have personal favorites.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   And the first book of his I read was The Alphabet and the Goddess.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.320]   And I've never spent more time reading a book because, again, it was one of the situations
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.280]   where, "What did I just read?
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.440]   Is that just as heavy and profound as I really think it is?
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.600]   Or am I not really carefully?"
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.960]   Then you read it again saying, "Okay, I'm going to need to sit down for a little while."
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.680]   That's a great thinker.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Exactly.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.880]   I mean, Alex just put it best.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   What a great, great loss.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.960]   I mean, you wanted him to live for 180 years and write another 19 or 20 books.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.680]   The great Leonard Schlane just passed away, but one of his books is on Audible.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.960]   And I think a great introduction to his way of thinking and understanding, it was my introduction
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   to Leonard Schlane.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.800]   And I went out then and got the rest of the books.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.680]   It's called Sex, Time and Power, How Women's Sexuality Shaped Human Evolution.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.720]   It's not a sexy book, don't worry.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.160]   It really is trying to understand what is it that makes us different.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.680]   What happened in the Cambrian explosion that changed humanity has to do with our most important
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.200]   questions about who we are.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.040]   And it's just great stuff.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak, if you go there right now, sign up for a goal account.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.040]   You can get any book free.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.280]   I mean, this is just an idea, a sample of the variety of wonderful literature available
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   to you at Audible.com.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.680]   This would be a great first pick.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.360]   Sex, Time and Power by Leonard Schlane.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.040]   And we thank Audible so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.160]   I'm so glad you brought that up, Andy, because I saw that in the paper the other day and
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.640]   I felt so sad.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.480]   I had no idea that you two guys had connections to them, or I would have begged you to let
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.520]   us interview them.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520]   We could have, yeah.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.120]   Oh, I'm mad at you now.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.240]   I should have probably gone around saying, "Hey, if you graduated Schlane, this guy's
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   great.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   I should have."
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   To me, he was lending.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   He was lending.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.240]   He was lending.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   He was lending.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   I gave this book.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   I bought many, many copies of this book and handed it out to many people.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   I just think it's such an important book.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.840]   I think the best way to really sum this up is he was sick for a long time.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   And occasionally, like, Waspa's friends would get an email from the family saying, "We're
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.720]   asking everybody to, on this day at this time, just think positive thoughts about Leonard
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.160]   and his healing."
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.080]   And I'm totally and instinctively on board with that.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.560]   And I had a little reminder on my iPhone at 4.55 that, you know, pull over the side of
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   the road.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.560]   It sounds silly.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:54.520]   Especially to, you know, people who listen to podcasts, it sounds very, very silly.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:59.000]   And I don't believe, my belief in religion in God does not mean that I tend to believe
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.320]   that if you pray for somebody, necessarily, it works that way.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   But you know what?
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.120]   I had that alarm and I made sure that I was in a place where I could spend a couple minutes
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.520]   just thinking about Leonard.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:14.640]   And when we were talking about it to friends of mine, who I know are just our real serious
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.520]   atheists, the sort of atheists where their atheism is a very nourishing and positive
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   thing for them.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   It's not just a sort of accidental thing.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.960]   And they're also really, really very, very hardcore skeptics.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.040]   And I'm sort of not wondering, "Oh, how is this going to, hopefully, I don't want to bring
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   this up?"
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.040]   I did that too.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.760]   I was just thinking good thoughts about Leonard because I don't know if it works.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.680]   I don't know if it doesn't work, but it would cost me nothing.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.800]   It makes me feel good to think about Leonard for a couple minutes on that day.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   So I did.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Well, we just did.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   That's the sort of guy he...
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Yeah, we just did.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.560]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   All right.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.040]   Time for our picks of the week.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.800]   And I'm going to start just so you guys don't steal my pick of the week.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.360]   I think I must have mentioned this before.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.080]   You know, we talk a lot about parallels and we talk a lot about VMware as being the two,
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.560]   you know, big competing programs for virtualization.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   We very rarely talk about Sun's Virtual Box.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.400]   And with the release, the new release of the latest version of Virtual Box, I think it
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.440]   is a strong competitor for VMware and Parallels.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.800]   And here's the thing.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.320]   It's free.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   It's free.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.480]   It runs very well.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.280]   I'm running out of my MacBook Pro.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.120]   And so what I'm going to tell you is a free way to put windows on your Macintosh for people
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.360]   who have been, you know, maybe hearing about bootcamp and they've been hearing about Parallels
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   and VMware.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.400]   And, you know, you got to buy windows and everything.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.600]   Well, right now Microsoft's offering Windows 7 absolutely free.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   It's on TechNet.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.000]   If you Google TechNet Windows 7, you could download it.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.320]   It's about a two and a half, three gigabyte download.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.280]   It'll be good for a year.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   So and it's...
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.360]   And I have to tell you, I've been using Windows 7 since the previous beta.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.920]   This is the release candidate.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.520]   And it's absolutely rock solid.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.440]   There's no reason to fear it.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.840]   It is very reliable.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.360]   Installs beautifully on a virtual box.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.160]   And there you have it for nothing.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.360]   Just two downloads, virtual box from Sun and Windows 7 from Microsoft.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.800]   For at least for the next year, you'll be able to run Windows.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.120]   And by the way, I think the best version of Windows they've ever made.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.800]   What's your opinion of as far as the creature comforts of, you know, anything?
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   It does everything.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Like when you install it and put it together.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Exactly the same.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.760]   The same feel as you would have with the VMware and Parallels.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.840]   They have the tools.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.920]   And by the way, they're tools installed on a broader variety of software.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.360]   It's for Linux, Windows.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.440]   It works perfectly well on Windows 7.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.960]   They have it for Solaris.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.440]   So you know, and it's very similar process where you install the tools.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.320]   That means you can expand the window.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.080]   You can move the mouse in and out.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.000]   It's got what Parallels calls a coherence mode.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.920]   I can't remember what Sun calls it, which is you can run an application just by itself.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.760]   You don't have to be half the whole virtual box running.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.720]   You know, there's some good news in virtualization.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.760]   I mean, coming along, we're going to see these hypervisor too capable of virtualization
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.600]   for the Macintosh and virtualization is going to get better and better and better.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.400]   And I think Sun is a, you know, a very credible competitor in this arena.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:10.720]   Are they are you able to add have more than one virtual machine?
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   In this version.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   So you could have like five, five different.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   I can't see.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   I'm honest.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.080]   I don't see much difference between this and VMware.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.080]   Parallels.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.480]   I don't think you can do that with VMware.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.320]   I'm all running concurrently.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   So having a whole bunch.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.680]   Well, it's a function of how much memory you have.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.520]   I mean, well, I thought it was something you had to get a bigger version of VMware.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.320]   There's the universal one box seems unlimited to me.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.120]   I don't know what the limitations are on VMware.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.680]   I mean, I own copies of VMware and Parallels.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   Right.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   And I started using one box.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.040]   I just I'm very impressed with the fact this is free.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.080]   You add Windows seven to this, which is easily.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.720]   I mean, if you, you know, look, we're none of us here.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.480]   We're Mac people, but there's times you have to use windows.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.720]   And if you're just at least a little curious about the new version of Windows, it's the
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.080]   best version of Windows they've done.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.560]   And this is all free and easy.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.960]   I mean, I bypassed Vista completely because I just wanted didn't want to go through the
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   pain.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   I did.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   You were right to do so.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   Just to because I'm a Mac guy now anyway, but just to keep my hand in really, just to
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.560]   see what all the fuss was about.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.480]   But it seems such a problem to to get a copy and install it.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   I'm not trying to window seven yet.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.040]   I might just give it a go just to see, you know, what it's what it's about and see what
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   the competition is doing.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.240]   And somebody's asking the friend of the room if bootcamp is faster.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.160]   Yeah, bootcamp is always be faster because you're running bare to the metal, but they've
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.080]   gotten now virtualization has got so good that it's very, very close.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.480]   And it just depends on what you're doing.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Like, right?
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.800]   We need to do a heavy 3D operation.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.400]   We're going to boot camp when we're going to do, but we're running quick books or Excel
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.680]   or for some reason like sell the quick books is better on the PC than it is on the Mac.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   When you're running a lot of this kind of stuff that unless you're doing heavy operations
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:45.280]   that need heavy OpenGL, heavy CPU stuff, you know, you're really there's no reason to
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.480]   go to boot camp.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.160]   What I would like to do, which might sound a bit weird is to actually run OS 10 in virtual
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.160]   machines.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.480]   I know you can do that for OS 10 server, bro.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.920]   I think that the desktop license doesn't allow you to virtualize.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.120]   But I mean, for my particular benefits, so I have multiple OS 10 machines so I can just
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.560]   carry in casts and stuff on them.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   That would be perfect.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   Actually, you're really good.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.160]   The somebody's pointing out also you can't run half life to.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.160]   You I wouldn't game in this.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.160]   I would say that one one.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.160]   When I can open.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.160]   You can't.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.440]   Yeah, you can't game in boot camp, but I wouldn't game in in VMware.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.440]   Parallels or virtual.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.000]   And a lot of people say that that in boot camp, their their Mac is the fastest PC.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.240]   Yeah, they absolutely.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   Absolutely.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.360]   You know, it runs very, very quickly.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.480]   I don't think the video cards in the Mac are as good as some of the top of the alignment
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   of your cards.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.080]   Hopefully going to be testing the new Nvidia Nvidia's making a car for the pro the pro
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.240]   card came out the quadro.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.960]   Yeah, the quadro and how much is that card just so we know what you're talking about
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   here.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.960]   It's $1500.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.080]   What would you say that $1500 and just thing.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.120]   Hey, but it's going to be cool.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   That's not your pick.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.120]   I take it.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   This is I don't have it yet.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.120]   I don't have it.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.640]   You might be like the can't put a price on that.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.360]   Anyway, virtual box and and Windows seven.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.560]   If you haven't yet put windows in the Mac, but you have some need to, that's a good
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.680]   combination that won't cost you anything.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.400]   You should know though that Windows seven will stop working.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.960]   I think it starting in March, it shuts down every two hours and then by May, it will just
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.800]   stop working entirely because it's a prerelease free prerelease version.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.400]   I think they just start giving it away.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.960]   Stop, stop losing ground by by then who cares.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.080]   You know, you'll you'll have tried it.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   You'll be done.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   It'll be over.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   Right.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   All right.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   I am going to give the floor over to Mr. Alex Lindsey since you seem to have something
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.680]   you want to get off your chest.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.640]   I've got two picks, two picks.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.400]   Once he once I got away with it, you know, so I got an iPhone pick and an app pick.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   All right.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:41.040]   So my iPhone pick someone twittered me this and I wish I had their name in front of me,
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.880]   but I don't they were I was talking about not being able to shoot serial number or bar
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.880]   codes.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.120]   We were talking about this and he said, Oh, but you can use snap tell.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.680]   And so I download a snap tell.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   It's free.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.400]   And so it's a yes, snap tell.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.960]   It's called snap tell.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.560]   And what it does is is that if you're taking pictures and this is really, I think, designed
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.360]   around books, if you're taking a picture of a book, it will you can take up you can take
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.080]   a picture of the book.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.120]   And I have I really took it through the range last night.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:19.360]   I mean, I was taking pictures of really obscure books, popular books, good lighting, bad lighting,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.400]   and it was 100% accurate.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.320]   So you take a picture of the cover, not the you don't even bother.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.920]   I don't even bother with this with the barcode.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.960]   You simply take a picture of the cover.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.400]   The reaction time is the thing.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.520]   So now Amazon has a service where you can take pictures of stuff and it goes off and
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.800]   it comes back, but it comes back at 15 minutes.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.520]   I'm already in another part of the store or somewhere else when it comes back.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:45.320]   The response time for this, at least on, you know, at my house was about five seconds.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.240]   So in five seconds, I have it back.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:51.680]   I know what not I know all the online prices.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:56.800]   I know what I but it breaks it down via it can be Amazon, but it also has a listing to
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:02.960]   the Wikipedia, eBay, half.com, Barnes and Noble, you know, the, you know, all of these things.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.640]   Now, this is this is also good for, I mean, you know, taking pictures of stuff that I
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.760]   want to send to people or whatever.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:13.520]   So the point is, is that, is that I can get all of that instantly and it shows me Amazon,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.480]   Barnes and Noble and Towers records.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.080]   Like this is how much it's going to cost online.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.880]   Now Amazon has a similar application, but it's only Amazon.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   Well, but it takes longer.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.160]   So when I take something of, I know, I know I'm getting really spoiled now, but, but the
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.320]   Amazon one, Amazon, I think a human's looking at it.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.640]   Yeah, it's setting up to some guy in India and the guy in India, you know, or, or, or,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.400]   or somebody in Iowa or whatever and they're figure, they're looking, they're doing a search
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.840]   trying to figure it out.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:41.320]   This is you, I'm guessing the only way you could do the speed is this is an image recognition.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.680]   It's looking at every cover and it replaces the cover that you shot with the cover that,
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.280]   you know, a nice scan of that cover, whatever's, whatever's already in Amazon.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.520]   I was blown away by how well it worked.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.520]   It's free.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.280]   So there's no reason not to download it and try it yourself.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.000]   The I'm guessing if they're smart, the reason, the way they're making money with this is that
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.360]   they're taking, they're getting an affiliate sale off of every order.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.520]   If you're wondering what their angle is, that's my guess and it is a Leo Herbie talk about
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:12.760]   the idea, this idea of, I was thinking, you know, barcodes, but, but this for just straight
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.880]   books and, you know, if a border's book store isn't terrified by apps like this, they really
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.720]   should be because it's, it's a picture.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.000]   Find a better price.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   See you later.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.440]   So now second out, second app.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.760]   This one's a little bit more expensive, not super expensive.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:33.320]   I think this one is about $119 and it's, it's by a company called.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.600]   Five, it's five spelled out 12.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   That's the number.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.360]   So 512.com and it's called numerology.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.920]   And, and this is for people in, I'm, for some reason, I'm really, you don't believe
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   numerology.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.840]   Do you know, it's not, it doesn't do numerology.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.920]   Go to, it's, it's, it's five.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:59.520]   It's, you got to, it's F I V E 12.com and no, I don't believe in numerology.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.400]   So the, that I give you the wrong.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.880]   But 12 is the number.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.160]   Five is a word, 12 is a number.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.720]   It's not a great, here's what I will say is that it's not a necessarily.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.880]   Five one two.com.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   All right.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.800]   So it's called numerology and, and they released it.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   Now what this is is a sequencer.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   I don't know why.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   All right.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.720]   Beatbox got me into this, into this thing where I, I started getting, thinking about
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:27.840]   sequencing and a friend of mine, an old friend of mine, David Beedney sent me this, you
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.800]   are this link last night and I started playing with it.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   And it, it is a lot of fun.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.720]   So this is a, you know, if you're really into building some mixes, they've got a demo that
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.680]   you can download and play with.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.040]   And it's just this way to design beats that is, you know, quite a, quite a process.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.080]   And you really have to watch the videos to get your head around it because it's, it's,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:52.240]   it's built for musician, but you're really seeing where this idea of really just sculpting
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240]   sound in my first round.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.880]   Well, it's playing a little bit of, of the sound, just so we can get an idea of what it's
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   going to sound like.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.720]   All I could do is like really good 70s tunes last night because it's with synthesizer,
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.240]   you know, I don't hear any sounds coming out of this.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.040]   Maybe I have it turned down.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.320]   See, I'm sure he's talking, but I don't, I don't hear any sound.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   I'm not getting a sound out there.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.960]   Anyway, it's, it, what, what happens is you can, you can, you can, you're looking at the
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.680]   cadence of what's going on.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.360]   You're then looking at the, and then you can add an instrument and then you can tie that
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.440]   instrument to that cadence and you can decide the volume and the pitch and you're sitting
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   there playing with it all.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.840]   And, and, you know, he's just looping the way kind of like beatbox was looping before.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.040]   And it's, it's actually just a really slick, you know, interface for kind of building these,
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040]   these beats.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.040]   How much is it?
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   I mean, it's 99 bucks.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   That's not too bad.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   No, it's, it were 119, 119 dollars.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.240]   If you're a garage band user, it might be something you could conceivably step out.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.080]   Yeah, I mean, this is just, this is just something if you, if you really want to build
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.840]   some fun, uh, MIDI stuff, there's some sound.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.840]   But it does sound a little MIDI sounding.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   It is.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.680]   But it's, no, it uses, you know, you can use MIDI and audio units.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.200]   I think you can probably import samples and so on and so forth.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.640]   I haven't tried to do that yet.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.560]   Um, so it does sound a little scinthe, at least from the, when you buy it because it's
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.480]   only coming with what, what kind of, with your Mac.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.960]   But then you can get some, some more samples.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   And stuff like that.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.000]   But it's, it's a, you know, if you like that kind of thing, you like a little, uh, dance
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.800]   groove or to have something in the background or to use as a, as a track below your, uh,
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.920]   um, you know, uh, behind stuff.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.080]   You know, a lot of times you want just kind of some kind of high energy, but low key and
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.920]   you want to be able to design it.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.120]   You don't want to just do a needle drop.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.720]   Um, this is a, uh, a fun little application and it's just a lot of fun.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.600]   I think that my whole thing about it is that I just have with a lot of these things, I just,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.480]   uh, I have a lot of fun, um, just playing with them.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   Messing around with the music.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   Messing with the muse.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   So it's numerology and, uh, it's five FIB12.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   Dot com.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.480]   It's 119 dollars.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   And now our guest, Mr. Don McAllister, you're going to pick for us.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   Right.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   Well, my pick, just the one pick.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.920]   It's a fairly specialized pick, but it's an application, uh, to be honest, that I swear
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.160]   by and I live by because it's, uh, it's something that it might appear to be just for podcasters,
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.480]   but if you have a news feed or if you'd, if you're into RSS in any way, um, it's sort
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.000]   of like the holy grail of RSS creation and that's feeder by reinvented software.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   And now it's upgraded, didn't it?
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Yeah, they've been out for a while, but they've just upgraded it to version two.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Um, so if you have any.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   So we use it now, I'm wondering if we should upgrade is my question.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   Um, yeah, there are some new features in the latest version.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Um, there was additional support for Amazon S3 and mobile me.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   So the nice thing with feeder is it not only does it allow you to create RSS feed, it will
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   actually take care of the upload of your enclosures as well.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   So if you have external media files, they're a part of your podcast.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   And again, a lot of people don't realize that with an RSS feed, you can actually distribute
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   other data items, not just audio and video files.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   So you can send PDFs around.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   You can actually, you can actually send software updates out using RSS as well.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   And this is all built into feeder.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   Um, so you can upload, it'll handle the uploads to any number of different services.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   It will allow you to create RSS feeds.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   It will allow you to also in the new version, it allows you to notify via Twitter and also
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   post a WordPress blogs as well automatically so that if you want to announce that you've
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   just published something using your RS feed, you can actually announce it in Twitter.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   I just think it's a really neat application.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I mean, I have, um, with Screencast Online, there's about six different feeds I have to
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   manage plus duplicate feeds that allow me to test the live feeds as well.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   So each week I'm juggling, you know, 12 different RSS feeds and feeder just lets me handle all
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   that as though it's an email application.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   It really is so simple to use.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   I'll second that.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   That's what we use at Twitter.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   All of our podcasts are posted using feeder.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   We couldn't have done it without feeder.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   I think it's also got integration with iTunes U as well, which is something, you know, if
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   the iPod in the iPhone is now getting more into education, educationists might want to
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   look at creating their own RSS feeds.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   I mean WordPress will create an RSS feed, but the thing with feeder is it gives you ultimate
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   control over what you do with it.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Well, it does the iTunes extensions and stuff.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Now, people use pod presses as a successor to pod press.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   I can't remember the name of it on WordPress, but this, if you really want a complete
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   notter control over it.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   And it has iTunes previews in so you can see what it's going to look like.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Yeah, I use that too.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   All sorts of things.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   So my people will upgrade.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   I've upgraded $40 for the full version.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   And we've used it for so long.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   I think they deserve another $15.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   Sure.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   If nothing else.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   Well, the funny thing was I was actually on the, it's a guy called Steve Harris who's
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   based over in Cardiff.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Oh, really?
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   He's a great guy.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Very responsive.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   So if you have any support queries, he's right on the money.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.400]   But I goed him about feeder because he's been putting out loads of updates and not actually
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   charging for it.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.680]   So he invited me onto the beta for version two and I said on one condition that, you
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   know, it's a paid upgrade.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.000]   Please don't give any more updates out.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   So I said, OK.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.680]   So anyway, once the beta had finished, he actually sent me an email with a registration
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   key.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   And I thought, hang on a minute.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.680]   No, I won't need to pay for that.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.120]   So I actually forced him to accept a payment for the upgrade because, you know, it's such
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   a great package.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   So how are press?
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.760]   That's where it's replaced by press.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   OK.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.280]   That's a very cool plugin for people who are podcasters on WordPress.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.480]   We definitely need to look at, we are trying to figure it out because we've had this kind
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.800]   of hodgepodge thing that made sense when we wrote it.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.280]   But it was kind of homegrown of how to manage the feeds.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.160]   And it's turned into, as we add more shows, it's just become unmanageable.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.720]   We, you know, we've been using feeder for so long and that's all we've used.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.360]   And I started using it.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.040]   Then Danes took over the feeds, now Colleen's doing the feeds.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:31.160]   But we've also been working with Gordon Hayden on our Drupal install that will allow us to
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.000]   because the problems we're posting on Drupal and then again on feeder.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   Right.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.520]   So we'll write out all of the RSS and we haven't flipped the switch.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.240]   But I think at some point we're going to do that because it just saves us a lot of time
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   in the workflow.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.320]   The good thing with feeder as well is it's template based as well.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.840]   So if you start from scratch, it's dead simple to it.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.000]   I have a Leo template.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Right.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Absolutely.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.440]   So that's a downloads existing feeds and adds them in.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.680]   So you don't have to, you know, I mean, it's just, there's a lot of really, if you're,
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.720]   if you have to create feeds, this is the way to do it for podcasting particularly.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.800]   So that's a feeder from reinvented software.com.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   Thank you, Dan McAllister.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.320]   Finally, Andy Inato with his pick of the week, Mr. Inato.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.160]   Well, I'm going to give you a small one and then a big one.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:18.760]   The small one is, I didn't realize how cheap 500 gigabyte, two and a half inch notebook
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.560]   drives had gotten.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.800]   I needed to, I'm sort of kidding out the next little number nine now before installing
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.200]   everything, just making all the decisions you need to make when you get a new machine.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.920]   And one of them is, well, okay, I want to have a big hard drive chiefly because I want
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.640]   to be able to do dual boot without any sacrifices whatsoever.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   So big hard drive.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.800]   I didn't realize that the 500 gigs had fallen so deeply in price.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.280]   Now you can get them for 90 bucks, 92 bucks.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:47.040]   And at that price, I'm wondering why anybody would not have like half a terabyte inside
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.880]   their Macbook because you really just love to have that feeling of why am I going to,
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.360]   I know this is just a 2k cash file, but why bother throwing it out?
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.560]   I want, I want a new icon for the trash can that has like just hammered and boarded shut.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.280]   So I know I'm just going to buy another hard drive whenever I fill this one up.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.720]   I'm going to be a wasteful American and make sure that I'm going to travel with every scrap
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.040]   of data I've ever acquired, collected or created in the past year.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.480]   The only difficulty of traveling with that little tiny, uh, network sometimes past couple
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.960]   times is that I'll be preparing a talk and I'll be, I did, I did my slides like about
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.080]   a week or two ago, but I'm going through them for the last time the night before I'm thinking,
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.320]   oh, no, it'd be perfect.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.400]   That picture I took eight months ago of, oh, I don't have it on this drive because it's
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.400]   only 64 gigabytes.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.240]   Oh, but rest when I have the 320 gig drive in the old machine or now the 500 gigabyte
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.240]   drive.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.760]   Yeah, pretty much every single drive, every single photo I've ever slurped in from a memory
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.960]   card is going to be on this drive.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.600]   So nice and cheap.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:48.440]   That's not, I don't, I happen to buy the Western digital Scorpio blue model, but the specs
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.040]   between the Western digital and the Seagate are just, it's just so close that you may as
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.640]   well buy, whichever one costs five bucks less.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.360]   I have to, I have to admit the Seagate issue that happened in December, hit us pretty
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.920]   hard and we're just terrified of using their drives.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   Really?
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   We had five drives go bad.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.160]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.800]   Yeah, it was, it was, it was a very unhappy experience.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.840]   And although I, I'm guessing it's kind of like after any kind of anything bad happens,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.680]   you figure the least, the one company that probably is going to happen is Seagate.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.640]   They're probably the ones that are most careful at the moment, but I know that with Seagate,
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.520]   and we've gone all the Western digital just because we're so, I like what it was so painful
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.200]   to fix the problems that.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.720]   And we've been buying Hitachis by the dozen.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.240]   And but I like the WD, the caviar.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.120]   But Andy, you got the, you got the Western digital, the, it's a Scorpio blue Scorpio blue.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.440]   I like it that they have colors in their names too.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.520]   Yes.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.720]   We use the caviar green.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.080]   You like the Scorpio blue.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:49.760]   We use the caviar black caviar black for speed, caviar green for power and heat and
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.000]   the Scorpio blue for price.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.640]   I sent an email to the support line saying, hi, I really want to buy your Scorpio blue,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.280]   but the lady, the Lancome's counter said that I'm more of an autumn complexion.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.960]   Is that the cause of everything that's not a gem tone?
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.480]   Yeah, Scorpio blue.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.760]   They're 5,400 RPM.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.320]   But again, like the caviar green, which is also 5,400 RPM, when you get such high
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.960]   aerial densities, I think you get pretty good throughput.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   Right.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.080]   Plus, I mean, if you care to check the system, as a system utility on your, on the drive
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.440]   that Apple sold you with your MacBook, those are 5,400 drives.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.440]   That's true.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.440]   Of course.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   Sorry.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.400]   I'm sure Alex would know more than I, but I mean, I've been doing, I've always, I've
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.960]   grown up ever since I was a wee lad being taught that you can't edit video at 5,400
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.720]   RPM drives.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.200]   But I sort of forgot about that.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.240]   And I've sort of forgotten that over the past, you know, eight or nine months, I've
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.080]   been editing like 720 PhD video in Final Cut Express, forgetting that, oh, wait, I'm
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   not supposed to do that.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.080]   What are you doing?
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:53.800]   These little drives are actually, it's because the aerial densities are so high now they really
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.120]   are there, you know, there's a lot of data coming off there very fast.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120]   Seek times are much lower.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.240]   If you're using, if you were using, you'd probably have trouble if you were doing 1080p
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.360]   with, you know, at HQ, you know, from an Apple Pro Res or something.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.080]   But if you're taking what's off your camera, letting nine movie, bring it in at 960 by
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.920]   540 or even 720, you know, whatever, I don't think you're going to have any problem with
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920]   it.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   You know, it's just not enough.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.920]   It's not enough megabytes per second or whatever to really hit the drives harder.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.400]   You can't do anything else, but I added lots of stuff on my laptop and my laptop is only
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   5400 RPM.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.880]   Yeah, I've always paid the extra though.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.640]   So it's a couple hundred books as well as it's not cheap to actually upgrade to the 7200
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.600]   drives, but I've never really tried the 540 ones to see if it does make a big difference.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.520]   And I paid twice as much to get half as much storage.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.880]   So there you go.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.200]   Although the course here that I bought, which I'm still loving, 128 gig course here for $320
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.600]   in my laptop, the speed is just remarkable.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.320]   And by the way, you posited that the transcoding would be faster?
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Yes.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Yes.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   You're absolutely right.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   It really is a lot faster.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.960]   So that's a big effect to give an update on the HD 264 turbo USB card using that with
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.120]   the Corsair.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.800]   Actually, it was both times it was the Corsair that it was twice as fast with the turbo
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.200]   card than without the turbo card on my MacBook Pro with a 9600 enabled.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.800]   So double the speed in transcoding.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Right.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:21.320]   So it was an MKV file to H.264.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   So big difference.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.440]   A lot of it's really a big difference with that and the hard drive.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   That makes a big difference.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.880]   Well, I'm deciding whether to go towards where Leo's going or towards Andy's going
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   to pass.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.680]   It's part of me that wants to spell out my hard drive, but the other part of me is...
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.640]   They've announced a Corsair 526 for $1000.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.520]   No, it's I think it's low as 600 if you shut up around.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.320]   Yeah, because the thing that I'm trying to figure out is whether I want to keep everything
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.280]   on my laptop or whether I want to say, "Okay, here's the deal.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.840]   I've got things I've got now that control.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.640]   I'm going to keep an external drive that has a lot of the stuff that I...
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.240]   Like Andy, has everything that I've ever had and all even more because you can have a
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   terabyte.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.120]   And then if I'm going to do that, we have a couple of Western digital 1 terabytes that
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.480]   carries that stuff.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480]   And then I back...
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.800]   It's easier to back them up without me using them on the computer.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.480]   And then the only thing that happens on my computer is just the scratch disk workload.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.960]   Because what my problem is, is I keep on.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   No matter...
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   It is like...
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   It's the bag principle.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.360]   No matter how big my hard drive is, I have 10 gigs left.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.960]   Yeah, I mean, I had the MacBook Air for the past 12 months and that only had the 80 gig
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   hard disk.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   And it wasn't a problem.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960]   It would just be more disciplined.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   Yeah, it would be more disciplined.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.400]   Yeah, I've gone over to the MacBook Pro and that's got 320 and I've got a lot more lazy
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.120]   and I'm just throwing stuff on there now and thinking about it.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.320]   But I went perfectly well for 12 months with an 80 gig hard drive.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.520]   I made a Lightroom external drive.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.160]   So all the photos, Lightroom's nice that way you could say.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.320]   Store the photos where I say.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.840]   So keep them on the external drive.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.680]   I'm keeping the catalog, which is fairly large now because it's a few gigs with the thousands
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.760]   of photos.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.120]   But the catalog's on the Corsair.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.680]   So it loads very fast and I have access to the originals on an external drive.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.400]   And I think that's a perfectly fine way to go.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.760]   And that saves me 80 or 90 gigs right there.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.760]   I think I might do both.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.800]   I think I might just have a 500 gig drive.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800]   (laughter)
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   I can't put two drives on that.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800]   Well, yeah, I raid them.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.240]   So they have a 500 gig drive internally and then have my external stuff.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.680]   I think I'll just just take out that battery, run it off AC.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.320]   You can put four more drives on that.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   There you go.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   Get a desktop.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.320]   Hey, I'm a Mac Pro.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.160]   Wow, I didn't think about it.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.800]   I don't know if I can do it.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.800]   He's going to do it.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   Stand back.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   He's going to blow.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.400]   It really does come down to style.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.880]   And I'm glad that we have such a wide range of attitudes here.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.800]   With me, it's like my MacBook, Lillof has always been like the Hitchhiker's Guide to
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   the Galaxy.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.200]   It's the one thing that I need to have with me.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.480]   That is my entire universe, my entire world, everything that I need to do, everything that
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.800]   I want to do.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.440]   And sometimes I just don't know what I'm going to need until I sit down.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   I sit down at my hotel room at a trade show thinking I'm going to be riding an 800 word
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.840]   column that's due tomorrow.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.480]   Instead, I wind up working on 800, 1800 words of something that's not due for three months
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.040]   because I've just got a great idea and I know exactly how to solve a certain problem.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.840]   So I have the same thing.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.280]   I rebuild my presentations before every talk.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.720]   I never do the same presentation again.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.760]   And I get in the same thing where, oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.600]   I know I have a photo of that thing that I want to talk about.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.600]   And I just go through my library and find these.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.720]   I have a BTS library in Aperture where I just kind of go, I scroll through there and I find
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:29.240]   all the, every time we're shooting, we shoot tons and tons of behind the scenes.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.880]   And I just grab that new photo that illustrates that new thing that I thought that, oh, I
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.160]   should really be talking about this.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.000]   So I totally know what you're talking about where you want to have that stuff with you
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.560]   because especially someone who presents a lot.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.280]   And I have every presentation that I do regularly on a thumb drive.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.240]   You know, I have a 16 gig thumb drive with every single presentation built just in case.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.560]   So I'll go back to that one, you know, because I've had times where my computer doesn't
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:57.040]   work or I mean, doesn't, I can't, you know, you go to, you go to Mac world and expect to
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.560]   have, because it's Mac world, Mac world that they'll be have a display port connector.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.480]   And I mean, I don't get more of his, I'm getting more and more reliant on Dropbox because it's
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.160]   so fast that it caches locally.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.800]   Lots of documents that I know I'm going to be using in the field where I'm actually just
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.120]   dropping to Dropbox and then with any machine I can pick up.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.480]   Dropbox is very handy.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   I use it all the time.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480]   It's very, very useful.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.040]   The other thing I've been using is Pogo plug.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   Have you got one of those yet?
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.040]   No, that's really cool.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.240]   Is that I came, I came like last week and I am so totally on board with the layout.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.240]   Yeah, so I'm going to use blog.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.240]   I don't know.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.760]   It's kind of like you're running your own Dropbox.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   So we have one over here.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.200]   I should, I know it's like it's like imagine just a chunky AC adapter that also has a USB
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.080]   port and an ethernet port and you plug the ethernet into your cable into your home broadband
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.400]   router and you plug a hard drive into the USB port and with them and just magically as
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:53.520]   long as so long as that Pogo port can contact the central server and report with the address
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.200]   of the devices, you can access that hard drive from any machine anywhere in your office, anywhere
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.080]   in the world or even your iPhone.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080]   So that's really...
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.880]   Using their website.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.040]   They have a third party website.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.240]   So yeah, it's tiny.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.720]   So basically it's, I mean you could do this with FTP if you have a NAS device, you could
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.720]   do it.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   But I've never seen it so simple.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720]   I mean it's so simple.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   It's so simple.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720]   That's the point.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.720]   The directions for setting this up, I thought it was a joke.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:20.000]   It's like when you get a board game and all the instructions are printed on the inside
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   of the lid, on the inside of the lid are three steps.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.600]   It says plug it in, go to this website, do what the website tells you and it's very,
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.600]   very simple.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.600]   It's very, very simple.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.600]   So I'm going to put it in the right hand side.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600]   So I'm going to put it in the right hand side.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   So I'm going to put it in the right hand side.

[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:03.600]   So I'm going to put it in the right hand side.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   It was probably better than I thought it would be, actually.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   I quite enjoyed it.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   I thought it was great.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600]   We had a long-- if you want to hear, we have a long discussion on
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600]   Twit this week.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.600]   OK.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.600]   And I'm seeing it like in four hours in iMac.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.600]   So take that under--
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.600]   No, no, no, no.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600]   I think there are no spoilers in the Twit.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   Well, the title of Twit is a spoiler, actually.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   Not much of a spoiler.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.600]   I think we had David Pogon yesterday on Twim.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600]   You did.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600]   That was your big name?
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   Yes.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.600]   And I think we got pretty close to spoilers.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   So you might want to--
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   Don't listen to this week in me.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   But he was great.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   So--
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   David's great.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600]   We got to get him on Mac break weekly again.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.600]   He was on it in the early days, but we haven't had him on since.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.600]   He's so much fun to have.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600]   He's very funny, very good.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600]   All right, Andrew Ennaco, thank you.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.600]   He's at the Chicago Sun Times in the Celestial Waste of Banwith,
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:58.600]   C-W-O-B.com, and joins us every week from his lair in Massachusetts.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.600]   Appreciate your time.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.600]   Good luck with it.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.600]   It's more of an airy.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.600]   An airy, is it?
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   Ah, oh, nice.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.600]   Or I'm having an upgrade to a Keep, some men are coming by and equating.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.600]   He's going to take this area and turn it into a Keep.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.600]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixelcore.tv and Pixelcore.com.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.600]   If you want to find out more about this great guild of multimedia artists,
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.600]   and he lives just upstairs, so it's always good.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.600]   Top down.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.600]   Swander down.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.600]   Sometimes I get dressed.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.600]   Sometimes I just have a simple, you know, a...
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   I've got a shirt on today.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.600]   Sometimes I just come down and I'm real.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   Sometimes it just wears a jammies.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600]   It's a Virginia road.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.600]   I should have a $20.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.600]   It's sort of fun to have a fire pole installed at the Twitckels.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.600]   That's the opening to everyone.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   We go, "fweee!"
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   And Alex Lindsey.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:53.600]   We really want to tape an open to our broadcast day that involves like going around the cottage
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.600]   and Alex would come down in slippers.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.600]   It'll be really fun.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.600]   We're going to be doing a Mac break from China.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.600]   Oh, look at this.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:06.600]   I forgot Don McAllister, Annie and Aco, and I, all three of us, are going on Mac Mania 9
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.600]   in a couple of months.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   Less than a couple of months now, it's only...
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.600]   I don't tell me that.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.600]   I just fit X to my Visa application and I hope it comes in time.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.600]   How fast did you get your Visa application?
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   I haven't got it yet.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.600]   Oh, oh.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.600]   No, well, in the UK they say a month before you need to apply.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.600]   Well, it's...
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.600]   I've got time.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.600]   Yeah, you should be.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   I'm not going to July's.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   Faith, is it?
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   Well, yeah, we're going to...
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600]   I think we're going to...
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.600]   You and I are going on the land.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   Yes, so I think we leave on the 3rd of July, so it's not that long.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600]   Six weeks.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600]   It's exciting.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.600]   And Andy, have you applied for your Visa?
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.600]   I've applied for my Visa.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.600]   I look forward to being met by some men and dark dudes.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   He said he's a journalist.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.600]   He's a journalist.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   I don't know how to...
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600]   What did you say you were...
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600]   You're an educator too, probably.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600]   I'm an educator.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.600]   I mean, as am I.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.600]   Insurrectionist is what I said.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.600]   That'll go over fine.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   You know, they love revolutions in China.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600]   Exactly.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600]   Exactly, you know.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   I'm a Maoist.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   Say that.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.600]   I have a picture somewhere of me and a Mao hat.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.600]   I should just bring that all over me.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.600]   [laughter]
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   I was young.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.600]   I needed the money.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.600]   What can I say?
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.600]   You can watch the show, of course, as we do it live every Tuesday at 11 a.m.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.600]   Pacific.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.600]   That's 2 p.m.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.600]   Eastern time, 1800 British Standard time or British daylight time, I guess it is now.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.600]   Also, you can watch...
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   Listen to the show rather on iTunes.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   If you just search for a tweet, you'll find all of our Twitch shows, including Mac Break Weekly.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.600]   Or in the Zoom store, I don't imagine that we have a lot of downloads of Mac Break Weekly
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   from the Zoom store, but you never know.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600]   It's there.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   It is there.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   Rob Greenley told me it's there, and actually I think he says very popular.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   So go figure.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.600]   Tip of our hat to all our Zoom listeners this week.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600]   And also, thank you all for being here.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.600]   We'll see you next time.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600]   Another Mac break.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   Now, what were you gonna say?
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   We were gonna do it from...
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.600]   Break time is over.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.600]   Break time.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600]   You know, I like that one.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   Break time is over.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   [Music]
