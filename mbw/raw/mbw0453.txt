[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560]   with the great Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.920]   He's not pixelated, my friends. He just plays a pixel on television.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.640]   I just have this low resolution background so that my face looks like it's even higher
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.760]   definition. It's so crisp. It's so perfect. You know what? I think the background
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.120]   probably works really well with the encoding. I just thought about that.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   If it helps with bitrate, anything, if you've got home broadband, it's like,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.000]   sometimes you're lucky to say, is it in color? Good. Is it stable?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.680]   Good. We'll take it. Also here from Montreal, it's Renee Richie of iMore.com. Hello Renee.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.880]   Hello, is there sun outside at shining all this green stuff on the ground?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   Oh, how do you handle that? I stay inside.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.520]   You know, we had your buddy Georgia on the twit, but she was great, by the way, on Sunday.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.080]   She's fantastic.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   And I'm glad to say that she was two-time Canadian national champion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.520]   Yeah, she wears the belts like Hulk Hogan style across her shoulders.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.280]   It's so intolerable. I'm so glad that it piss her off. Even when she's shopping at the deli,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.240]   just you're not. I'm not sure she'll be on the other American.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.920]   Do not mess with me. I have to deal with these twenty-four-and-five-thole.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   Did you get into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu because of her or did you get to know her because of that?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.280]   We were doing Chinese martial arts. We did that for like 10 years, and then she said,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.760]   "I'm tired of this. We're going to go do this something else." And we all said, "Okay,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   you're the boss. We'll do it." Oh, okay. So you knew we were on her for ages.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   Yeah. And she's really good at knowing, you know, what the next course of action
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.680]   should be. Wow. She's a leader. Yes. Speaking of leaders.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.480]   Verso is here at Verso Kelly. I've known Kelly Gamont for a long time. I just didn't know her name.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.920]   At Verso on the Twitter. Hi, Kelly. First time on Mac Wrigley. Welcome. Welcome.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   Yes. I'm super excited to be here.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.920]   From Macobserver.com. You may remember from Engadget and elsewhere.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.160]   An app camp for girls. Yup. Nice. Are you a counselor?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:40.320]   I am. I've been a counselor. I've also been MC. It's for me to keep time and let everybody know
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   what's coming up next. Of course, the great G. McDonald's also participant. And that's really
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.120]   great. We're going to talk a little bit about that. You told us some great stories from that,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.280]   and they actually have their first app. Yeah. From app camp for girls. We'll talk about that in
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.840]   just a little bit. I suppose we should talk about there must be some Apple news.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   As producer of the show, I can say really. There's some stuff.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   You act as though this panel is not for dynamic personalities that can have it entertaining and
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.600]   into a conversation about practically any topic. Well, that's a good point. I'm banking on that.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.960]   Maybe you were about to prove that today. You already proved it. I came in and I heard all this
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.640]   going back and forth about what people were wearing. I thought you were talking about Age of Ultron.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   The new Avengers movie. It turns out you're talking about the Met Gala.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.200]   Mashable has almost the complete red carpet. All of these men and women in their fancy dress.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.680]   I was curious to see. I wonder if any of these people have an Apple watch and decided if this
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.040]   Apple Ultra Ultra Ultra fashionable event, I'm choosing to wear this watch because I see it as a
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.360]   very, very fashionable thing. I have not seen it anywhere. Certainly not on any of the women's
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.640]   risks. The men, they're doing that weird thing where you don't roll up the sleeves of your tuxedo
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.000]   to leave your hands free for smart watches. I don't get fashion. Not that this is a bad thing
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.680]   for Apple that none of them are wearing it. It's the other way around. It would have been
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   what a coup it would have been for Apple to have people who are wearing these $18,000 gowns that
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.520]   they know they're going to be photographed in and they know that every detail is going to be
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.560]   looked at. If they said, "You know what? I absolutely want to wear this Apple watch because I do
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.000]   believe it's be wonderful and fashionable and this is part of the statement I want to make."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.960]   Did you see? Oh my, whoa. Did you see? Sorry. I forgot that there was a
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.280]   safe for work. I have an average dress brought to you by spray adhesive from 3M.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840]   It could have been embarrassing. Where would you put an Apple watch? I guess would be the question.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.760]   I'm sorry. Go ahead. There was a mixed bag because we saw again this weekend with,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   I forgot how to pronounce his last name, Manny Pacano with the boxing where they're doing all
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.440]   these Samsung photos and the minute the match is over, he's tweeting from his iPhone and you
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.560]   could just see a bunch of people wearing Apple watches and then at the thing right after it's
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.120]   over, they're tweeting from their pebble and then you just never know what's going to happen.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.440]   Yeah. It's like I saw Age of Ultron over the weekend and I'm not completely convinced that Tony
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.920]   Stark's Tony Stark uses Samsung tablets. But he does in the movie.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.960]   They indeed. It's amazing because your inside is lab and he's showing these amazing,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   like huge immersive 3D glowing data representations and then he says, "Oh, I've got the data right
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.240]   here." And he hands over a commercial like the Galaxy Tab 10 with the Samsung logo on it.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   It's like, "I'm guessing you have something better than that and it might have an Apple logo on it."
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   I just, this is why product placement sucks because if it's unnatural, like, in the,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.400]   wasn't it in the House of Cards that just kind of in a random moment, they're talking to the FBI or
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.040]   something and the guy says, "Wait a minute. Let me throw this to the screen. He's got a Samsung
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   tablet and he goes like this and it goes to the, it was like an ad. It was like the middle of the
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.800]   life. Hawaii 5O has been doing that a lot like just this week. They had a long conversation with
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.640]   Cortana and they kind of made fun of it. Like the guy's only friend is Cortana, which is not a good
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.760]   message. Yeah. I thought it was historically funny that like on Parks and Recreation, it's like
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.000]   two, only 2% of the population owns a Windows phone, but it seems like all of them are sold to
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.760]   people in Pawnee, Indiana because the only phone anybody ever uses is a Windows phone device.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.400]   And they don't just show it to you. They try to teach you like in one of the scenes, it's like,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.240]   "Let me show you how to send a quick message or how to share a photo." And it just takes you
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.720]   ahead of the show. Yeah. Well, sometimes they say no though. Like the latest news from the James Bond
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.840]   movie, the new James Bond movie that is coming out in November that is called Spectre that I'm
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.680]   ridiculously excited for. I don't know if you've noticed.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.280]   Was that, did you take a breath in there at any point? I did not because James Bond and it makes me
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:56.400]   have to talk with my hands. Is it still Daniel Craig? Yes, sir. I actually like him. I do too.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:04.080]   My wife says you can't be a blonde bond. See, Mr. Kelly says that. I disagree. I love him. But
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:11.680]   they said Sony wanted Daniel Craig to carry some sort of Sony smartphone. And Daniel Craig and Sam
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   Mendes said, "No, no." Good. Because James Bond would use the best. Oh, ouch. Sony. That's a public
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.680]   quote from Sam Mendes. And it says Sony Pictures Production. Yes. So that's why they were like,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.200]   "Well, you know." And it, no. When I handle those awkward Symbian phones on Batman and Iron Man
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.040]   for a while, where they have like their hologram phone in one scene and then the most ancient possible
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.240]   Symbian Nokia phone in another one. Oh, please. Oh, no. This is my favorite dress from the gala.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.320]   Don Johnson's daughter Dakota wearing it. What looks like metallic mirrors is a Chanel.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:51.680]   But I don't see you right. I don't know. Oh, I went backwards. That's why. This, I don't see any.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.840]   Did you find, did you guys find any Apple watches anywhere? No, I didn't see any. And like I said,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.080]   it's not like it's being a phone. But you're not carrying a phone. I didn't see them. Yeah.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.720]   You're probably not carrying a phone, right? Oh, also. Yeah. I mean, it would probably be
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.360]   on, I'm guessing that they'd be, if it was this guy with a gong. It's a Chinese themed. We're lucky
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.840]   for Manchu was banning at the door. Excuse me, but sir, what's the deal with the gong? Is that
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.000]   your outfit? Maybe that was like Ben Stiller. I think it's a staff. Maybe he's like judging the
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   dresses that they walk by like, gong. Oh, there you go. And if you get gong with the gong and
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.400]   Sims, nope, I'm sorry, insufficient butt coverage. You will go on your party.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   Something McDonald's across the street. Just this picture, it feels like it really is all about
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:43.280]   butts and gongs. Yeah. And we have a show title. It is. 31 minutes in. All right, we haven't talked
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.600]   about Apple at all. There we go. See, he's doing his job. But the context of this was,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   and talk about a long way around, we were looking for Apple watches. You guys,
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.600]   you know, I really don't think we're going to see a lot of Apple watches in the wild. I think,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.320]   I just, okay, I know I'm kind of beating a dead gong here, but I just feel like there's not a
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.400]   compelling story. I'm going to say they can't ship enough. I know, but that doesn't, what does
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.280]   that mean? That just means that the there's going to be millions of Apple faithful, you know,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.120]   five or 10 million. They're just going to buy, buy, buy, and they're going to buy right away.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.880]   They're going to buy sudden scene. They don't care. But I think that it's going to
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.560]   trickle out into the world a little bit and people are going to go, I don't really see the real need
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.880]   for that. Well, I don't know about that, but it is, it is a significant data point that almost
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.040]   everybody who has one on their wrist right now is someone who has had never touched one, had never
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.680]   had absolutely no experience with any of the software on it, had no idea what the apps would be.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.920]   They did buy this on faith. And that's like, that's not a bad thing. That doesn't indicate that
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.440]   there are people who are early believers saying that this is such a, I believe in this concept so
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.000]   strongly. And also I feel it for me personally, Apple has such a strong track record of making
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.880]   things that I like and I'm willing to gamble 350 to 400, even a thousand dollars on it. So that
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.520]   has to color a lot of what people are saying about it right now. The real challenge comes,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.960]   I do think that in the summer, when the taps get open on the production line and now you can walk
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.360]   into an Apple store, place an order and have it, have it in the next two or three days,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.160]   those are going to be like the more regular people. It's like you, there are people who are fans of
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.640]   James Bond, they're people like me who are fans of "Rays of the Lost Ark" and "Star Wars" and these
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.880]   movies. And we're not the people to tell you how awesome it was to see a new "Star Wars" movie
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.200]   after 20 years because we're probably going to like episode one for many reasons I have nothing
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.960]   to do with what's actually there inside the movie theater. Yeah. I'm going to go back to Jim
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.240]   Daurungpuss, metric where it's not so much how many people? Sorry. No, sorry, I just, I have no
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:55.280]   reasons to like episode one so I was curious. I had to see it a second and third time before I was
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.200]   even able to process it as a movie that's telling a story with characters. The moment that I'm sitting
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.640]   there in the theater and I hear the Fox fanfare and then I hear the Star Wars fanfare and I see the
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.960]   yellow crawl and I realize that oh my god, I don't know what any of those words are. I'm going to
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.480]   actually have to read this. Okay, that was good for the next 45 minutes. And then it's only on the
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.520]   second or third. I realize that just the novelty of seeing a new story set in the Star Wars universe,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.920]   I finally burned that off and was able to say, okay, I like these parts of it really didn't like
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.680]   this. I really hated this part of it. And I think that Apple Watch is going to be a little bit of
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.400]   the same thing. It's going to take a while to for Apple fans and for people who are just fans of new
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   things to sort of burn off their expectations of, well, I was in this school, I was in this novel
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.760]   and finally, I guess this shorter, shorter way of putting is that I like the pebbles. I like the
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.720]   Pebble Watch. I enjoy the Pebble Watch. I review the Pebble Watch after 30 days. However, I found
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.040]   that I was only using it as a timepiece. Like I was only using it to find out what time it is.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   I was using I wasn't using any of the features. And at that point, it went back in this box.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.000]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.880]   I was just going to go back to the Jim Dallenable Metruvary said that he's most curious about
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.280]   who's going to wear it a weekend, a month in, three months in. And that's when you start to see,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.800]   based on the use, not just who's buying it because you can buy anything, but it's using it
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.480]   over a long period of time. Here's somebody in the chat room gave me this time called a
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.880]   comic from the New York Times magazine, the amazing new thing, panel one, what is that thing?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.120]   I don't know. But I really want one. Panel two, what people are saying about the amazing new thing,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.520]   the amazing new thing has changed my life. I thought the last amazing thing was amazing,
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.760]   but there's no one's even more amazing. It's ridiculous. Trinket for overpaid hipsters.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.680]   Why can't everything be this amazing? I hear they're working on an even more amazing thing.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.400]   I'm going to wait for that. This is all true. Let's alternate panels. We'll make this like a
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.480]   like a like a you do you do you I'll do one you do one. All right. Delivery day.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:07.200]   Now you're amazing new life. Here I come. Feedback. Would you like to give feedback on my amazingness?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:18.880]   Sure. A completely amazing. B kind of amazing. C barely amazing. D not amazing at all. B.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:27.840]   B really? Sorry. It's fine. Totally fine. A few months later you start.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.800]   Renee and Kelly. Renee and Kelly can jump in as well. Renee, you start off. Where am I?
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:42.560]   I wish I knew. I've we've been here for years. This must be a mistake. I'm sure she'll be back
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.640]   for me soon. She picked me up once, but all she wanted was my batteries elsewhere.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.960]   Such a toy story moment.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.920]   Play everybody. Yeah. The cigarettes, the smooth drugs. Smokey finish.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.480]   That's something that like when I get a new iPhone, I stop using the I like the new iPad comes
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.000]   out. I start using that a lot more than I use the one that I had two days previously and new
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.760]   iPhone comes out. I start using that a lot and I go back and forth because the new thing always
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.680]   is interesting and compelling and there's new discovery. It's it feels like why we climb the
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   hill and cross the river. Yeah, I don't want to be a grump. I mean, this is this is there's a
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   I mean, it's really there's a lot of you can tell a lot of energy you want to do this watch.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.840]   You if feels like the software has been they've been working on it for years, there's a lot of
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.200]   fine tuning the hardware, a lot of fine tuning. I'm not saying that forward. Everything's gonna
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.280]   get better now. Yeah, see, I just my feeling is. Well, no, but I mean, like Apple entering the
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.600]   market and putting this down means that Apple's gonna make a version too and Google has competition
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.920]   for Android where Pebble is doing it just it just makes the entire market more interesting for
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.000]   everybody. My questioning is not the Apple Watch. My questioning is the category itself is this
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.680]   is this I don't feel like this is, you know, I mean, look at Apple's trying to get everybody's
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.560]   trying to get repeat the success they had with the iPhone the iPhone, which did not sell very well
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   at first relatively is a phenomenon that changed the company. It's their business now. Everything
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.760]   else is a minor part of their business. And of course, it's their job to come up with the next
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.920]   iPhone. Do you think this is it?
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.800]   Nick, nobody there's no other product. There's not even another phone that makes money like the
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.040]   iPhone does. The iPhone is a singular phenomenon that I don't know if anybody's gonna reproduce.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.440]   Samsung certainly doesn't make that much money Motorola, all the phone companies. It's almost
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.240]   unique. I don't want to call it an accident, but it is so far irred reproducible. So I think
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:45.120]   everyone is trying to get more legs on the table like more iPad businesses, more iPod original
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.800]   businesses, more Mac business, just a bunch of other things that taken together will make
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.520]   significant income. Do you think that Johnny I was right that Swiss watchmakers should be worried?
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:02.240]   No, what did no, that's that's that's that there's some there are some times when even
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.520]   brilliant people say things that make you think, Oh, sweetie, it's it's so adorable.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.720]   We're gonna we're gonna write that down. We're gonna put that on the fridge because Swiss watch
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.320]   makership. Oh, that's apps. Although I do hope that those watchmakers adopt the like the easy to
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.400]   change straps and the easy to size straps. I do like that made a lot of advances in the category
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.000]   of straps and like telephones that have been an industry where they had decades to do that
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.680]   and nobody did and now maybe they'll start moving that forward. They had those really ridiculous
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.120]   pins. In fact, I'm getting I'm getting a new Android watch tomorrow and it's 22 millimeter,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.760]   which means I have to use my little pin hammer and my little pin to realize that the that's not
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.400]   really an Apple innovation. The reason why watchmakers haven't done that before is because for $400
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.360]   for $350, which is the minimum buy in for a watch, you can have several watches and not have to buy
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.080]   a separate band because you put so much money into this face and sizing them were paying you
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   to take them to a jeweler or get a special tool set like with mine. I have to get a special tool set.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   Well, I'm saying I'm saying that if you look at the top of someone's dresser, you would see three
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.400]   or four watches one expensive one, one more sporty one, one more that's a more fun stylish one. I had
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.200]   an uncle who was vice president at a bank and who'd wear these very expensive suits but with his
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.080]   free floor orange Florida citrus promotional watch because that's the one you like.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.480]   So I mean, it's it is. There's another thing. You kind of hit the nail. They're these interchangeable
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.840]   stuff, but you kind of hit the nail and the head and the inadvertently, I think, which was that
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.560]   watches were sold by jewelers and watchmakers needed jewelers. Jewelers were a big part of it.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.880]   So the fact that you had to go to a jeweler to get a different band or to get a link removed from a
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.480]   band was a part of the, I think there was no incentive for them to take that out. That was
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.120]   that was the business that brought you back into the jeweler, right?
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.320]   Why every Kung Fu teacher was a chiropractor Leo day in day out business.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.600]   Yeah, exactly. So accessory, this is, I just took the strap off mine. You see how easy it was to do.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.720]   And I guess these are standardized across the whole thing right.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   And the link bracelet, you just pop your little button on it. You take links out, you resize it.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.680]   I love that. Anybody can do it. And the modern buckle, like my mom went for the try on and she's,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.640]   she's a senior and she has arthritis and she has trouble with jewelry, but the modern buckle is
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.560]   actually magnetic and she had a super easy for her. It was an accessibility feature and none of
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.880]   her other jewelry offers her that. Well, I think that's why I got this because it's accessibility
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.440]   and sizing. I got the millenies because it's very easy to put on. And I think this is the kind of
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.480]   thing that, you know, Apple entering into this market, hopefully you will get other brands and
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.080]   other people doing, and they've not exactly the same thing, then the same idea. Right.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.400]   Well, it's one of the things that I think sometimes gets forgotten when Apple announces a new product
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.200]   like this, which is something that they hadn't done before. There were MP3 players before there
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.160]   was an iPod and there were phones that could give you email and had web browsers before there was
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   an iPhone. And there are watches that will show you notifications from your phone before there was
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.640]   the Apple Watch. So I think there's a certain amount of that that sort of gets lost in the new
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.240]   of it. But as supply lines loosen up, you know, you are able to walk in and get one or at least
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.080]   if you try to order one today, your ship date isn't the middle of July. When we get to that point,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.160]   I think there will be a lot more of it. And I think once sort of once the novelty of it wears
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.280]   off because like a lot of more technical people know about the Pebble and, you know, got in on
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.720]   the Kickstarter and that sort of thing. But I think there were a fair number of people who
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.120]   probably don't know anything about it and didn't realize there was anything like this that came
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:37.840]   before. And once those folks are able to try one on and go, yeah, I'd like to buy this and then
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.200]   have it in a day or two. Those folks, I think that's when we're really going to start seeing this
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.120]   take over and see a lot more of it out and about. And by then it won't be new anymore. So it's not
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.600]   going to be a thing. It'll just be something that you notice. Like now you notice when somebody pulls
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   out their iPhone on a red carpet or at some sort of event, like you see a lot of celebrities with
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.200]   iPhones and it's not a big deal anymore because there's been an iPhone for a long time. I think
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.720]   we're going to have that with the watch as well. Yeah. It's it's it's it's Apple has such a big
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.400]   challenge ahead of them. And as does Android, Google and as does Pebble, because I think that I
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.720]   really do think that people who have what who have made a watch decision that they're very, very
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.320]   comfortable with, either they've decided that I don't want to strap something on my wrist every
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.720]   single day. I don't need a watch or they decided that I love this watch. It's not just simply a time
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.800]   piece. It's a piece of style that I just really, really enjoy. And when you talk about something,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.520]   a device that has never really existed before that they maybe don't even know somebody who has a
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.200]   smartwatch. What does it take to bust that bust them out of that existing habit? What gets them to
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.720]   take stop wearing their grandfather's watch that they got after their father died two years ago
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:54.240]   and replace it with a gadget. So the message I it's it's been said that that that NASA spent more
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.320]   money on the simulated moon landings than Russia spent on their entire lunar lunar program back in
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.200]   the 60s. And it seems as though however much money Apple spent on the design and the manufacture of
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.600]   these watches, they should spend just as much just educating people and getting the message out there.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.080]   Here is what it will do for you. Because until millions are out there and until everybody knows
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.160]   somebody or even has somebody in the family who has a smartwatch, I can say, hey, you got to
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.600]   you have an Apple watch. You have a smartwatch. How do you like it and get a positive answer?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.720]   That's a really high high hill for Apple to climb. One of the things that
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:31.280]   the iPod fostered was an and the iPhone after it is a massive accessory movement. In fact,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.240]   Mac break weekly Mac break weekly Mac break Expo became about the accessories was like the
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.480]   Mac the Apple accessory Expo. Well, see, yes, it's still like Matrix shells of cases. Yeah,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.840]   there's a whole yeah, yeah, pavilions devoted to accessories for the iPhone.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.280]   So we are starting to see people announce that they're going to do something. Jordan
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.960]   Kahn had the story of nine to five Mac. I don't know. I think now it might have been discredited that
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.320]   or at least Apple says we're not going to allow people to do this. There some accessory makers
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.200]   want to access the hidden port to put a strap with a battery in it. Now can that happen?
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.240]   Yeah, it's not a hidden port. So there is something very closely akin to a lightning port
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.200]   on an looking for where is it? So if you take off the straps, Apple actually in the production
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.280]   models, it's in the development models is open, but in the production models, it's glued over.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.040]   Yeah, there's a little piece of metal over it. You're not even. Yeah, and it's really hard to
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.280]   take off and you probably don't want to. It's really meant for Apple to take off and do diagnostics
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.800]   at the store. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And they don't you don't want to access him that Apple had
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.160]   just last night. In fact, they released if you go to developer.apple.com/watch/bands,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   they created the made for Apple Watch program. They have a new certification. They released it
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.640]   yesterday. Yeah, and that specifically says you can't do this sort of charging thing. And
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.840]   Serenity did an article about earlier today, but there's a lot of reasons why you don't want a
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:58.480]   piece of metal that can get hot with charging with there's all sorts of dangerous signs that go
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.600]   with human flesh contact and any sort of charging. So I am encouraged though that the Apple will
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.680]   offer will allow a third parties to offer bands. That's good news. And they're going to provide
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.120]   the lugs for you. So you just have to make the band and they'll provide the lugs.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.840]   Oh, that's interesting. The lugs are the lightning connector. The thing that you can't
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.240]   manufacture. I'm not sure if you can manufacture without violating some intellectual property.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.800]   I would like to I would like to get the load. What do you mean? This the metal part that slides
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.680]   in that only Apple can make a lug? No, they're they'll provide them to anyone who wants to make
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.400]   the straps. I think Greg from Luma Labs was talking about like it's possible to make them,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.600]   but it's it's a heck of a manufacturing process. Oh, how interesting.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.720]   If you just want to make straps and you don't have to and you don't you know, you're not set up to
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.480]   make high-precision stainless steel lugs, you don't have to do that. Oh, it is a very powerful
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.760]   magnet on the Yemilinese Loop. Do not swallow it, kids. Yeah, I'm looking at the I'm looking at the
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.120]   actual developer document to look at all the requirements. I'm kind of interested that they
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.080]   have made a it says bands must not prevent the user skin from maintaining direct contact with the
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.480]   Apple Watch heart rate sensors and backup Apple Watch. That makes sense. Well, I was
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.280]   otherwise you lose you lose the heart rate sensor. No, I was thinking about that that that this morning.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:19.120]   There are some people that have a I guess they want to protect the skin from it. No, no, I'm saying
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.280]   I'll I'll just go ahead. I'll go ahead and study even though if it might be incomplete. I know a
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.880]   lot of people for whom the big attraction was that the Apple Watch can use a heart rate sensor that
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.760]   is not on the on device itself. They can they do a lot of trains. They have a wearable sensor.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.920]   And for them, look, I've already got a heart rate monitor already connected to it. I would
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.120]   much rather have this on like a new preen band that is that is not going to interfere with me as
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.640]   I work out with it. I'd much rather have it on another stable deck or maybe even would much rather
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.400]   have it be able to take it off and put it on a workout device that I have because for some people
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.640]   like you have Harry risks or some people, for instance, with the with the steel watch, they have an
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.280]   allergy to the nickel that's inside the metal and they have to sort of figure out if their skin can
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.520]   actually deal with it. Given it's it's interesting that that is an absolute requirement given that
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.480]   they can get heart rate data without actually having contact with it or even just for this idea that
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   look, this is my watch. I want to wear it the way I want to wear it. And you know what? I really
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.440]   like these gladiator sort of style bands. I don't care that there's leather underneath it because I
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.640]   don't actually use the heart rate monitor features of it. So it's interesting. I was very pleased to
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:34.560]   read through it and see that there is absolutely nothing nothing related to actual style so that
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.960]   their Apple is not doesn't seem to be reserving the right to say, yeah, that's a really ugly band.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.720]   No, you're not allowed to put that on our watch like Tony start right in the chest, Andy.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.040]   By the way, somebody Curtis being the chair, and says the other reason you don't want to lose skin
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.440]   contact is because of Apple Pay. That's how remember that's how the watch says, Oh, yeah, you already
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.200]   certified this with your thumbprint. Yeah, but that's a feature. But what if I don't use Apple?
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.760]   If I don't care, right? Yeah. So the six pin diagnostic port.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.720]   Apparently can be used for charging good luck getting it. You'd probably getting to it. You'd
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.320]   probably have to bring it somewhere. That felt like a dumb idea to begin with because almost
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.520]   and it's like welcome, welcome visitor from another world who has never never dealt with Apple before.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   You realize that as soon as you spend a half a million dollars to tool up for this, Apple releases
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.760]   a software update. Oh, I'm not allowed going to allow you to charge from this on a prove device.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.840]   And now you're out of business. And to be honest, I haven't had any problems with battery life on
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.680]   the Apple watch. So I'm not you're addressing a worry that people don't need to worry about.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.760]   About 30, 40% left at the end of the day. And I'm a pretty heavy user. Yeah, it survives the day.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.560]   No problem. And also like all it takes is for one of these to be badly made. And then there's a
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.320]   class action lawsuit against Apple. So they've become incredibly cautious. You don't really want
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.760]   lithium ion batteries wrapped around your wrist charging them. Yeah. And it gets hot. I mean,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.200]   one of the reasons they didn't do radio, at least my understanding, or the reason they didn't do
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.800]   radios in the first generation is because of the heat issues and they were sensitive to well,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.520]   they were sensitive to the sensitivity in people's skins early on. Somebody also in the chat room
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:12.480]   says that kickstarter there is on Kickstarter, a already funded Apple lug project. So there you go.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.200]   Chug a lug? No. Jug lug? No. I'm sure I'll find it lug nuts. No.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.160]   Lug a bug child. People with lug related products really know SEO.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.280]   There are lugs everywhere on Kickstarter. Good luck finding the lug.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   Well, maybe if I put Apple watch. Hey, let's search for Apple watch on Kickstarter. You think
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:45.280]   there'll be anything there? Click the first watch band adapter for Apple watch. Oh, there it is.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:52.160]   That's it. Click lets you use any 22. Oh, good. Any 22 millimeter watch band with an Apple watch.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.520]   So defeating the entire purpose. Renee makes a good point. There's a difference between
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.600]   manufacturing something that will fit in there and will work for a couple of days and making
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.840]   something that a month or two later won't break off. We'll still be a happy experience. This is
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.920]   nice. Look at this. It's a nice little stand and charger for Apple watch. Takes your phone and
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.000]   your watch. There's some nice charging stand. That's pretty. I know Griffin just announced one,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.680]   right? Just released one. Yeah. This one's nice. The problem with the Griffin one,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.600]   I don't think it would work with my Milanese loop because it looks more like it's for the
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:37.200]   clasp watches. Boy, so that's it. This is one I'd like to get. They got they've raised $202,000,
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.920]   $1616 backers. So I guess they funded. So now you're going to have to go to Shopify to get this one.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.840]   I like that. Every time I see a successful Kickstarter page, I always think about that scene from
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:57.200]   the producers. I said, how much of the show have we sold max? We sold 530% in the show. I know.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   How many percent can there be? There can only be 100% of anything max.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.280]   What happens if the show's not a flop? We go to jail max.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.960]   One of the things that reminds me of is there's a lot of people who are real watch aficionados.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.520]   Like my boss is like that. He has six or eight high end watches and he has special cases for all
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.240]   of them and sets of tools that look almost like little, little, I don't know what's called toy tools,
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.320]   but they're so tiny. It really is this whole lifestyle thing. Now we're seeing these accessories
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.880]   for not really for watch you watch people, but we're seeing now you're going to stand for your
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.480]   watch and you don't have this whole thing for your watch. It's interesting. You want to get a
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.760]   headache? Here's a simple keyboard for Apple Watch and Android Wear. So you can type right
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.120]   on it. You want to get a this is my biggest complaint about the watch. One of the reasons I'm
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   not convinced the category, not Apple Watch specifically, but the category in general
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   is for everybody is that it's just such a small unit that it's hard to have a good UI on
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.000]   something like this. Believe it or not, there is a keyboard on this. So that like it
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.280]   I know that my phone's like, yeah, for God's sakes. I'm fascinated by people who don't understand
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.240]   that something that has a screen is not necessarily a desktop PC. Oh, here's another one. This is
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.920]   kind of a cute one. And they have a long way to go. The unified doc by Andrew and Kyle.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.160]   Hi Andrew. Hi Andrew. Hi, Andrew. Hi, Kyle. This one is also a everybody seems to want to make
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:27.680]   a unified thing. Look at all of these. Well, because a lot of people have something
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.080]   on their nightstand now to charge their watch overnight. And so this is just a way to charge
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   everything at once. Oh, this one comes in gold. I'm like, gold one. Oh my god. I'm saying gold to
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.440]   match your watch. Well, that's not bad. Don't spray paint it.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.280]   We are by the way, on the screen, the new screensavers on Saturday, Kevin Rose is going to be
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.040]   co-hosting. You know, he's watchville. He's really in the watches. So we're going to do a thing on
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:58.560]   watches. And then we're going to there is there is a a project that will for just 400 bucks, I think
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.200]   gold plate your your watch. So they're going to come in and gold plate my watch. It looks awesome.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:10.720]   What could possibly go wrong? It takes a few hours. Is that he's only the aluminum watch you
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.960]   can go play? I thought it was a stainless steel, but okay, maybe I can't get a gold plated.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:22.640]   Here's watch Doc steel, a colorful charging dock for the Apple watch. This is all on Kickstarter.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:31.120]   So I guess we I guess to answer my own question, yes, we are we are going to see a massive accessory
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.000]   movement. Here's an interesting story. Pebble Times Kickstarter orders tripled after the Apple
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.320]   watch was announced. Yeah, get people go. Oh, so you were right. This does jumpstart the category.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:48.800]   Yeah. All right, 7.5 million results for Kickstarter Apple watch.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.920]   There's going to be a lot of people who see an Apple watch think that's a good idea, but for
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.760]   either they don't have an iPhone that's compatible or they just don't want an Apple watch. They see
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.440]   that there's alternatives like Pebble or Android where the Garmin and they want, you know, they
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.160]   want on board GPS, for example, so they go with the Garmin. By the way, I really, I just really like
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.320]   the idea that we have three or four different makers with not just competing products, but
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.720]   three three or four completely different approaches to the concept of a wearable of a
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:18.640]   rise top. I love that. And that's that's what I really, really agree with you. I ordered the
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.360]   LG watch the Urbain, which is a round face. It should come tomorrow. That's the newest Android
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.240]   where with Wi-Fi built in. So I'm very I think what you're going to see is this great race.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.280]   Or less at least like they might not take off like you might be right, whether the product
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.080]   category is child. But I like that all these smart people are working on it because that
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.880]   gives us the best chance of actually getting it. Best chance of it. And I think that to your point,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.760]   Kelly, in the past, Apple, and I've mentioned this before, but in the past, Apple has taken
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.840]   existing category and twisted it and made it take off. I don't get that feeling about this. I was
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:58.240]   waiting to see if Apple found some magic sauce in here that made this watch extra special. That
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.960]   was the worry within Apple because a lot of people there when they were working on the Apple Watch
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.840]   project, they had years of looking at Windows tablets, years of looking at smartphones and years
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.480]   of looking at music players. And they felt like they really knew what the problems were. This,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.120]   you're dealing with a product that's traditional, that's got decades, if not a century of people
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.680]   being deeply attached to their watches, but also not a very long time of smart watches. So you don't
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.280]   have as much time to see the problems and see what people really want to do with them. So it makes
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.200]   it a more challenging problem for them to enter. And not the same way they usually enter categories.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.080]   Right. I said this at the Yosemite Conference in my talk a couple of weeks ago, that Apple is
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.600]   like the emperor and the starboard is like he is fueled by they're fueled and powered by hate.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.840]   Like if you show them, because when they design the iPhone, it was based on all of these engineers
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.240]   and designers are carrying around Windows phone and and and Palm phones, all these phones that
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.400]   they hate. And now they want to build a phone that they don't hate. And in the interview with,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:00.000]   I think was Johnny Ivan, I want to say wired. He was talking about how by contrast though,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   we love our watches. So we wanted to make a watch then that reflected all the things we love about
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.920]   our watch. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. Tell you what, we'll give you a really badly made like
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.640]   buy a bag, a hundred of them for $5 off an eBay wristwatch. That will show you things you hate
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.400]   about design and you'll and ways to design a really great watch. Don't don't design it based on
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:26.880]   something you love. Your hate will make you powerful. I can feel you wanting a wireless charging
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:34.160]   boy now, because you can't stand the Samsung cradle that required for charging their device.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:42.320]   Yeah, failure is now complete. Kelly, if you laugh at them, it just encourages them. I just want to say
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.280]   courage. How about you? I am encouraged. Palpatine for everybody. Yeah, I spent all of yesterday
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.840]   wishing everybody Star Wars day and assuring them that it was not a thing. And I got the Darth
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.320]   Vader pair too. That was the sale was buy one, get one half off. So I now have two pairs of Star Wars
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:07.520]   vans. I'm so excited. Oh man. You want to show those to us? I would but they're upstairs. Okay.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.600]   It's on your Twitter feed. Yeah. And they're stupendous. So I'm super pumped about them.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.880]   Awesome. I'm so happy for you. Everything is going to bite.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.360]   You know, I was actually looking since we're talking about like these things are just sort of
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:30.480]   being turned into gold. There are AMC or whatever company was making like the Star Wars model kits.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:37.680]   They were like losing steam. And here it is. They're losing steam on on on selling these things.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.800]   It's they decided to like start what if we took like the same like old molds and we just like
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.480]   start plating these things in solid gold. It's a lot. Oh yeah. Here's like X being addition.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.400]   This is how you make something special. Huge. And because Andy plate the thing and gold and
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.240]   you got a new product. Look at this. This is gold. Geneia UK company, the Apple Watch spectrum
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.480]   collection. They have managed to take something beautiful and make it truly ugly.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.000]   Are they the one that make the golden gem in crusted? I thought. Yeah. 24 karat gold rose
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.520]   gold or platinum with Swarovski style, Chris style crystals and a choice of exotic animal skin straps.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.760]   It's like a chocolatey popsicle. It's not chocolate. It's the classic never ending battle.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.160]   Apple tries to try to drag gold gold colored apple things into respectability and elegance.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.840]   This company tries to drag it all the way straight back into tacky.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:39.680]   Time back to tacky with a new alligator skin 24 karat gold apple watch elite and can I have
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:48.000]   the initials YOLO embedded on there? So I guess they take the stainless steel and they played it.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.200]   Brown crocodile black crocodile natural python orange python turquoise python red python
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:03.040]   syreeze pink python. You know you want it ladies. Black. I want to show off how much money I have.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.560]   I'm buying the watch edition, but then sending it to these guys to have it gold plated.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.280]   I'm going to buy rose gold and have him played it normal gold. It's only a thousand pounds.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.880]   But in French, so you know it's fancy. Yeah, fancy. That's only a thousand pounds.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.120]   I don't know if that includes the watch. Oh, wait a minute. No, sorry. That's a little misleading.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:28.720]   That's your deposit. Oh, geez. It's actually 1997 pounds. So a damn well letter include the
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.920]   watch. The million dollars Canadian. Yeah, it's a billion dollars Canadian.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.120]   Understanding why Apple wanted to capture this market saying you're so stupid enough to spend
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   that much money. We want to get that money. Now we know why they weren't wearing them with
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.400]   addresses. They were all busy getting this done to their Apple watches. They just didn't
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.360]   have a ready in time for the Chris see. That's why nobody that's what we haven't seen them.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.720]   Yeah, you didn't have enough bling. I think you're nailed it. Yeah.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.680]   J. Lo's going to show up with this next time.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.880]   Well, there you go. Gold Genie.com if you want it.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:10.240]   I'll take a bite down to it, army. Take it down. Let's take it down. We're going to take a break.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.040]   Come back with more. Did somebody's asking the chairman, did you get your watch? Yes, I did.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.080]   So Apple shipped it early, which was nice. I got it last week. So Lisa has hers. I have mine.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:28.400]   The much anticipated benefits of being in a couple with matching Apple watches materialized
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   briefly. Watch is with benefits. And then I and then I yes, I sent her heartbeats.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.520]   She sent me heartbeats. And that's that's the end of that.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.320]   My sister's arrived during the show. Really? Yeah. That's a sport.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.640]   Yeah, she ordered the well, we got it. My mother and I got it for her for a birthday.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.080]   Oh, isn't that sweet? Yeah. I told us before she's at works in a hospital and she was there.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   Paging system is on Apple personal notifications. And right now she's using a pebble.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.560]   Oh, this would be perfect for her. But yeah, but the pain has limited range.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.440]   And because this can be on the same Wi-Fi network and she can get all the pages,
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.720]   it'll be much easier than because women suits again don't have pockets typically
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.440]   and then put it in a lab coat, then it's heavy. So she's going to I don't I think she's going to like
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.600]   it. Nice. Our show today brought to you by Linda.com. My good friend Linda Wyman, who has created such

[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:23.120]   Here's the Apple watch. What in this economy, cheap shots are definitely your best shot value.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   I don't want to spend a lot of money on a shot. I want to go with the inexpensive shot.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.640]   I go just go to the warehouse store, get the off brand, the store brand shots.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.600]   Oh, if you say the Monair, they're deductible Leo. Every shot's deductible. Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.720]   Everything I do is deductible. Basically my deductible because I'm on air all the time, right?
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.160]   Bow ties deductible. Yeah. Watch as it's deductible. It's like it's deductible.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.280]   So, uh, here is it. I mean, these guys chip works like didn't or actually, I guess,
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:57.840]   is A B I research today, uh, an S one D capped. They took the chip, the system, actually,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.280]   the system on a chip in the Apple watch and they stripped off the plastic packaging
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:10.560]   to see what's inside. You know, I've been cautioned about this a couple times. What? Why?
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.000]   Both this and the I supply stuff because Apple is doing so much custom custom.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.160]   So I understand. Now that it's, it's, it's really hard to properly identify the components
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   and price the components. Yeah. No, I don't buy the 87 bucks. Some of these might not be,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.400]   some of these might not be accurately named. Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. Because you notice,
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.160]   there's no, there's markings on some, but few, not all of them. So the ones without markings,
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.080]   it's a, it's a good guess, I guess. And by the looks like they really destroyed the memory on the
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.680]   right there when they opened it up. It's all S round. There's no DRAM on this thing. It's nuts.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.960]   It's all S ram. There's no DRAM. What does that mean? So I can't think of a computer that's had
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.280]   S ram. S ram has made memory before it's just static. That's the static RAM that doesn't need to be
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.640]   refreshed. They, it's just a rethought. I don't think Apple's, like Apple's hardware team gets a
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.160]   lot of credit. I don't think that their platform architecture team gets enough credit because when
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:05.440]   you look at things like the A8X and you look at things like the S1 chipset, their Apple was not
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.280]   a chip company very many years ago. And then Steve Jobs basically did what he did with a lot of
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.800]   things. And he said, I just want the best, just get me the best guys. Didn't, didn't really know
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.000]   what they were going to do yet, but said, I just want the absolute best chip people. And they hired
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.160]   a lot of really good people from AMD and other companies. And with the, with the last year's
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.840]   iPads and iPhones and now with the Apple watch, we're seeing some really innovative, really interesting,
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.320]   really powerful chips. And the nicest thing is because they don't sell chips away like a
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.400]   Qualcomm or another company does. They don't care if they make money on the chip or not. There's no
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.560]   incentive to keep costs low or be profitable on the chips. They just want to make money on the whole
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:44.000]   package. So they, they are throwing unbelievable resources behind this stuff. And we get results
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.400]   like this, which is really cool. Let me think about this. This is a, you know, 38 millimeter, 42
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:55.520]   millimeter square on your wrist that contains and admittedly, maybe this, the name brands are
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.200]   suspect, but the, what the actual function of these things is, is real. You got your Wi-Fi,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.440]   Bluetooth and NFC chip. You've got a accelerometer and a gyroscope. You've got an NFC signal
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:13.920]   booster and NFC controller. As you said, four gigs of static RAM, not dynamic RAM. That means
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.800]   that probably helps with battery, I would imagine. You don't have to refresh the RAM.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:26.960]   The main processors right in the middle there, there's a PMU memory manager, the touch controller,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:35.040]   the wireless charger that's on the bottom there. I don't know what an NXP is. And then eight gigs
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.160]   of flash memory is pretty remarkable in a thing the size of a postage stamp.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.480]   It's a computer on a chip, which is what a world we live in. It's, it's, it's miraculous.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.440]   You know, you've just got to admire that. And you see, like, you see the results with that,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.640]   because people originally were like, oh, why are you going to 64 bit? It's meaningless. There's
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.720]   no big four gigabytes of RAM, but they get the faster instruction set. They get hardware
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.040]   accelerated encryption. We get all these benefits and then they get to produce stuff like this,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.840]   because they're making so much RMI-P. It's, it, it ends up being a virtuous cycle for them, I think.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:16.080]   Chipworck says that the accelerometer gyroscope is six axis. I don't know. I mean, obviously
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.000]   that's two better than four axis and it was always six axis, but my understanding is that
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.800]   it's more integrated now than it used to be. Yeah. In the iPhone six and six plus, there was a
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:33.040]   six axis sensor and a Bosch three axis accelerometer. But here at six axis all for in a single component
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:39.840]   for both is amazing. And of course, battery life benefits too, when you get this kind of tight
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.480]   integration. You don't need as much power. That's all Johnny's, the other Johnny's,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:52.720]   Arruji's team. Wow. The, you know, the only thing that has markings, the Broadcom radios have markings.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.880]   It looks like the accelerometer and gyro sensor have markings.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.920]   You know, not, not much else. The Apple chip has a marking APL 0778.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.120]   Flip chip bottom. So we're looking at the bottom of the chip.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.640]   Wow. That's great design work. That's just, it's neat to see this.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:25.040]   I like it's, I, I, this is the sort of stuff that gets me really, really interested, not the
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:32.880]   chamfer angles and not the lab in which it's like, it's, and so much of this is based on extensions
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.040]   in printing technology, believe it or not, because they have to find a way to deposit
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.240]   things on a surface. I don't really, really, really find scale. Then it was years ago, like five or
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.320]   six years ago, but someone was someone in the chip making industry was telling me about how
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.200]   really feel as there are people who work in this business that feel as though they have a direct
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:57.040]   line to photo engravers, people who design money, people who even back to Gutenberg,
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:04.080]   because it's all about how thin a line can be lay upon a surface. And apparently the,
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.680]   there are people in two communities that feel as though there's a lot of overlap between the two.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.840]   And just you think about how many transistors are on that one square of metallic gray in the
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.240]   middle of that. And you just, you're looking, you think that you're a caveman trying to figure
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.040]   out, but that's really possible. I can't believe humans can do this. This is, this is an aerial
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.880]   this is an aerial look at a city, isn't it? This isn't it? It's amazing.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:33.520]   Do you have one, Kelly? I do not. So it's just me and Renee here sitting here with our
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:40.400]   watches. It is not for lack of desire. It just turns out that I'm a unicorn by being a Mac user on a
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:48.880]   budget. So the only one, huh? I'm the one. Yeah. I just got a new laptop. I have, I went for the 13
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.400]   in Tretna. Yeah, I bought one too. I love that. Yeah. The force, the force touch makes me so,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:02.480]   so happy. Yep. And so I have that. And then at my house, it's alternating years for cell phone
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.920]   upgrades. Yep. So I'm in line later this year, I'll get the success or whatever it ends up being.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:13.200]   You're going to be glad you waited because the success is going to be so good.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:23.280]   Yeah. I'm on whatever. So good. So good. I'm on whatever the track is called. Some people call it
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:30.000]   the the evolution track as opposed to the revolution track or on TikTok, I'm on the talk,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.040]   whatever you want to call it. I'm on the S track. So I got a 4S and then
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:42.560]   then I ended up on the 5S and then now I will be on the 6S. And it's mostly because I see the
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.840]   camera being the big improvement and I use my camera constantly. So I decided to eventually
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.360]   switch to the S track. So, but there's always one in my house. So if I need, if I need something
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.520]   off a 6 for whatever reason, Mr. Kelly's got one, I can always, you know, pick up his and try
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.320]   something if I need to. So do we think they'll be forced touch on the S's? That's the rumor.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.560]   Boy, I would love that. That would, that would make me say, oh crap, I have to upgrade.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.040]   A year, a year from now, we'll look back on everything that Apple released in late 2015 and 2016 and
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.080]   say, yep, we should have seen that when we saw the first forced device on the Apple Watch,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.000]   how they could apply that to damn near anything else. It's, it really is one of the most exciting
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.200]   things that Apple's doing for the past five or six years. It's hardware related. It's almost
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.360]   as important early as multi touch. It's multi touch made multi dimensional. It's yeah.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.120]   But we're also facing the dilemma where we have to start to figure out what does
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.760]   forced touching mean? Because we understand what a tap means. We understand what a tap and hold
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.240]   means. We understand what a double tap means. We have to all agree that when you tap and
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.280]   force touch on something, that means one thing and one thing only because we have to learn.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.840]   If we have to learn what forced touch means on every single different app, that's a feature that
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:01.600]   we won't be using. I was looking at a message thread about that now that people have, the early
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.520]   people have had their watches for a couple of weeks now. Now they're finally discovering things
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.600]   that they weren't able to figure out at the very beginning. And most of the times when someone's
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.480]   tells, hey, do you know that you can do this? Like, how do you do that? Well, you have to hold
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.120]   and then force touch. Like people are not discovering what happens when you force touch something.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:23.200]   And that might indicate that might point to more education or apples needs needs to create a
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:27.280]   standard of here's why people expect here's what people expect to happen when you force touch on
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.360]   something. I confess I was a little confused. I every when I first started sending my heart beat
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:40.400]   to Lisa, I would press too hard. I don't I thought like, oh, you have to hear, I'll do it. I said,
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.960]   long press versus force touch is an interesting interface. Yeah, I thought, oh, you have to
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.880]   press hard to get your heart rate into there. And so I was pressing hard. And what I was getting
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.200]   was an interface. And I know I don't I don't want that. So you have to relearn that you just you
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.600]   just put your hand on there lightly. On the Apple Watch, it's a right click. But on the Mac book,
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.360]   they do a lot more with it. And because it's a bigger surface and the iPhone is theoretically
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.280]   a bigger surface and the iPad is an even bigger surface, you'll probably have a lot more options
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.520]   as well. And it becomes those things almost it becomes interface depth where you want to put the
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.760]   stuff that's most important for everybody at the top where you need almost no discoverability,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.560]   like the most important information on a website. Then as you go deeper, the features are still
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.360]   important. Otherwise, they shouldn't be there, but they're not necessary to the interface because
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.080]   fewer people are going to automatically discover them almost like the second year of information on
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.640]   again on a website. And you want to sort of build that that feeling into people. So like, for example,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.520]   you can force touch on the emoji to change the face from yellow to red or to change the heart from
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:44.560]   red to blue or purple. It's not necessary thing to do. But if you one day push too hard, because
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.040]   fits his law when applied to force touch means people are going to automatically press harder than
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.640]   they need to. Sometimes you'll discover that it's a nice bonus, almost like you got a prize for
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.800]   for playing around with the interface, whether that works again, like to Andy's point about
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   what that means on a trackpad or on a bigger device. I don't know, but so far, I think on the Apple
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.720]   Watch, being able to just do one thing, that right click, I think people will learn that not
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.560]   easily, but they'll learn that over time. But it's also going to become go ahead, Kelly. I'm sorry.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.240]   Well, it's going to become it's going to have to become something where what that means get
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.960]   sorted out because like right now there's not a lot of apps available that are using force touch
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.520]   even on the MacBook. For me, the greatest upgrade, but I keep looking over there because it's right
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:33.280]   over there. For me, the greatest thing about it is that because the entire thing presses and it's
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   no longer the diving board of the really impossible pushing at the top and all of the clicking really
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.160]   has to happen at the bottom of the trackpad. For me, with my teeny hands, it's been really nice because
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.760]   I'm able to leave my hands on the keyboard and navigate with my thumbs and even click right up
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:57.280]   using the tippy top of the trackpad, which is even more convenient. So because I started on
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:04.800]   the first Apple laptop I had was a power book. And on the power book, there was this whole vast
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:10.480]   no man's land between the track ball, which had the button at the bottom, and then the keyboard
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.840]   up at the top. So I got used to sort of having to maneuver that. And it's so much more convenient
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:21.040]   now and I can get so many more things done. It's just that with the force touch, there's not a lot
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.800]   available in force touch right now. So as people sort out, like Renee's talking about what those
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.840]   interactions are going to be down there on that second click. That's when it's going to get really
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.800]   interesting sort of like when it turned out that right click was becoming more common in Mac OS
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.560]   and people had to sort out like what do you put in the right click versus what goes up in a menu
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.040]   command and what sorts of things do you want to be able to interact with while you have the mouse
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.480]   right there on the thing. So I think there's going to end up being sort of an evolution of that
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.520]   interaction. And on the watch, it's pretty straightforward because there's a little bit more limiting
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:01.120]   factor of the tiny screen. So if I could force touch the home button on my iPhone and program
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:06.080]   that to be something, that would be awesome. Yeah, and it's interesting to look at how, again,
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:12.480]   the difficulty of educating people on a brand new thing. We often praise Apple because they're
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.320]   really, really good at having a really good first flight out of the box experience. But there's
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.520]   also the need for have some depth things that are it needs to also be to be easy to use two or
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:28.480]   three months after you have it. And it's bad if you take away features for the sake of simplicity
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.640]   without adding depth that people can discover later on. It's okay to tell people that here is
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.720]   a video, here's an instruction manual, here's a PDF, here's an iBooks, you'll be able to download
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:41.520]   for free that walks you through how to do things because they'll be confused for the first couple
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.080]   of days, but it will result in a much richer experience. And then going back to the first Mac,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.000]   you think that's a good example about what does the what does the right button do. It was a very
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.120]   explicit choice when they were designing the Valisa and then the Macintosh that mouse's before
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.200]   then have had lots of controls and lots of surfaces on them. No, we're going to cut this down into
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.640]   just one button because people have never used a mouse before. We're just going to confuse them
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:10.160]   if we put lots of buttons on it. Famously, this was a keyboard that didn't even have any cursor
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.520]   keys because well, you've got the mouse and plus we don't want to clutter it with lots of keyboards.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.040]   But then soon enough, you start to have the ability to right click on things and soon enough, you
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.400]   start to add function keys and cursor keys because this is the sort of stuff that leads to a richness
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.720]   of experience. But I do at the same time think that I don't think that people would have figured
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:34.080]   out the Mac as well as they did in the first year if they had been forced to swallow the idea of
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.240]   here's what a graphical user interface is for the first time. Here's what a mouse is for the very
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.560]   first time. Here's what icons and wind and overlapping windows do for the very first time.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:49.360]   So it's interesting to me to think about what they will do. Not certainly not this year, but next year.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:54.320]   Not only will there be a new Apple Watch hardware, but they might decide to say that now that we
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.360]   have a generation of users who understand how to use Apple Watch, we might be able to add some
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:05.920]   stuff to it that won't confuse people on their first day. But now that we look back on it, we
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   can add some more richness to the experience by adding this one extra standard control that
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.960]   can pop up pretty much everywhere. How is force touch different from just pressure sensitive?
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.440]   It's a form of pressure sensitivity. With typical pressure sensors like
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.520]   Awakom tablet, there's sort of an intermediary layer that some people think gets in the way of
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.320]   the display. It's debatable. With this, it's a different sort of technology that is detecting it.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.400]   It's again, it's based on that sandpaper sort of force feedback and it lets them do
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.120]   different types. So you can assign very different values to it, but because of the
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.960]   Taptic Engine working with it, it can also provide different sorts of feedback where a pure
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.240]   pressure sensitive engine isn't giving you tactile feedback to describe the sensitivity.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:54.560]   Look at this. This is a couple of parents who shared their newborn baby's heartbeat
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.080]   using the Apple Watch with family and friends.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:06.320]   That's pretty amazing. To Andy's point too, I mean, what a birth announcement, huh?
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   Look how cool that is. That is kind of, I'm going to tear up a little bit here.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.760]   It's so sweet. Yeah. Oh, great. Yeah. Or maybe it's just creepy. I don't know.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:22.080]   To Andy's previous point too, OS 10 has a terminal. You know, both people never have to see it,
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.760]   but if you want it, you can go there. Apple Watch has a home screen. It's not the primary
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.200]   interface. They take you to the watch face instead, but if you're used to iOS, you can go to the
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.760]   home screen. Some of those might get deeper as we go on. Some of those might be training wheels
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.920]   that they shed because now you're used to your natural language gets so good you never need them
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.240]   anymore. Maybe they figure out some other interface. I do find I use Siri more than I do touch because
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:48.800]   interface with a little mini icons. It's just too crazy for me. That's absolutely my experience.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.440]   I'm out of 362. I use voice for pretty much everything that I want to do with it.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.680]   Yeah. I mean, it's a safety valve that's there in case you need it, basically. You can go back to
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.800]   using it like an iPhone if you really need to. Same way you can go back to using a Mac like a
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.200]   command line if you really need to. Yeah. I did want to remind myself of something. I did want
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:10.320]   the same response to what Kelly was talking about that. We all too often ignore the fact that this
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:17.440]   is still a $350 gadget for the cheap one, for the least expensive one of these $350. That's a lot
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.920]   to ask for somebody to take a complete flutter on something they haven't tried before. I mean,
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:30.000]   I wouldn't even say that Apple has a problem compared to other ones. There's a mother's day
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.200]   promotion on Motorola.com or if you want to buy a Moto 360, you can now it's $70 off. But even
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.480]   that's $170, $180, which is a lot of money to spend on a gadget that people archivents that
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.120]   they need yet. So, I mean, this extends to laptops, extends to phones, it's extends to tablets.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.920]   And sometimes it's something that's important not to lose sight of that. We can say that the
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:58.480]   iPad mini is a really superlative piece of technology. It's a wonderful thing to have, but at $400,
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.760]   a lot of people have to ask themselves, "But what the hell am I going to do with it?" And
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.120]   what kind of results is it going to deliver to me for $400 that I won't get off of a $70
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.280]   Kindle or even just simply not having it. So, on the other hand, if you've got the discretionary
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.920]   funds, yeah, no, no, no, no. I think Groobers said it right. Let's not knock it. It's fun. It's a toy.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.120]   But it's a fun toy. What's wrong with that? I'm not going to.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.600]   I'm just saying, like you, it's not an assessment. I'm saying that luxury.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.640]   Part of the long conversation we should have about all technology is accessibility.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.120]   Yes.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.640]   And I would like to think that I'm broad-minded enough, I'm most speaking for myself,
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.800]   to not only appreciate how well designed the 12-inch MacBook is for $1,300, but also to appreciate
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.560]   that my God, Samsung and other makers are making hell of great notebooks for $200 and $250.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.560]   And it just it bumps me out sometimes when I see certain people or certain blogs or certain
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.960]   places say, "Oh, look at this. It's made out of plastic and only has a mobility processor."
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.360]   And, "Hey, look, like clunky VGA adapter on there. Your piece of junk."
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.960]   You know, it's about the race to the bottom for these people. They don't understand design and
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.920]   elegance. Like, yeah, but these, you know, they're people who don't have $1,300 or don't have $900
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   for the cheapest portable Macintosh, no matter how well it's designed, no matter how much it earns
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.160]   every dollar of that. And I do feel as though the $900 MacBook Air does earn every dollar of that.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.040]   I'd like to have it. I can't have it because I don't have $900 to spend on this, but it's nice
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.520]   for people who do happen to have $200 and $250 to spend. What's wrong with them having a nice notebook
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.440]   too? They don't care. It's made out of plastic. Yeah.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.600]   Well, I've talked about that too a number of times and that's technological honesty and the fact
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:49.760]   that a lot of people, once you get away from sort of the on-paper kind of specs, what you end
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.720]   up with is a lot of people for whom an iPad would be a really great computer. You know, they don't need
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.920]   an iMac necessarily and may not even need the full keyboard and everything of a MacBook if it's
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:06.480]   the occasional email that they're sending, you know, a keyboard case even for a lot of people is all
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.160]   they really need. Like, my dad's primary computer now is a tablet. I don't even remember what it is.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:19.280]   My mother-in-law's Windows XP laptop that I kept running for her as best I could.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.800]   Is no more because a couple years ago we got her an iPad for Christmas and it makes her so happy
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.120]   because she can do things on it she couldn't do on the laptop because with FaceTime she can talk
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.040]   to her grandkids in Alaska and she can do all kinds of things that she was doing before and it's so
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.640]   much more portable and it's way easier for her to use and she doesn't have to call me near as often
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.760]   because something is going weird with it. So it's really nice to have that and you know,
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.720]   I know a lot of people who once they sat down and went, "This is really what I need out of my
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.880]   computer." It turned out that an iPad was fine. Yeah, or Chromebook. I sent a lot of people to
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.080]   iProb as in Chromebook. A Chromebook is a great way and if you're somebody who does in fact need
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.560]   the keyboard for whatever reason or it's just a strong preference, like a Chromebook is a really
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:14.400]   good way to go. That was part of the one of the contenders when we were looking at getting my
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.120]   mother in law something new for Christmas was, "Well, do we just get her a Chromebook?" because she's
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.120]   used to having a laptop where you open it up and there's a screen up here and the keys down here
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.360]   and I said, "You know, an iPad might just be easier." And it turned out that that was the way that we
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.200]   went but it could have gone the Chromebook way and I get the feeling that more of my family
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.320]   as their computers hit the decade mark or more when those things finally give up for whatever reason
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.840]   I think that they're going to end up on something like a Chromebook or an iPad just because they
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.080]   sit down and go, "This is what I do with it and I don't need all of that stuff. I don't sort of
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.600]   the megahertz race is over now for a lot of people and if they sit down and really go, "This is the
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.440]   thing that I need," then they really end up with something that makes them totally happy but maybe
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:07.760]   five years ago wouldn't have been the same decision because they would go, "Oh, I need a computer
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.000]   because I need all the gigahertz and there's got to be the ram and I need hard drive."
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.760]   Yeah, nobody talks about that anymore, do they?
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.160]   That conversation's over, thank God.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.840]   And it's so much nicer now as a result.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.040]   So what is Kelly's next phone going to have in it? So we forced touch, it's going to have a
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.480]   little bit faster processor. Do we know anything about the camera? How much better the camera is
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.440]   going to be?
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.880]   There's those links, rumors. The grouper talked about it a few months even before the links thing
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.120]   was announced that they were going to start doing a regular race.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.200]   It's exactly like HTC'd.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.120]   No, it gives you depth because it's their offset lenses so it gives you depth information and once
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.360]   you have depth information, you can start doing a lot of interesting calculations.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.120]   I love that idea. Although it never materialized in the M8 or M-
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   No, I mean, they tried though, I give them points for trying.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.200]   Of course, I think if Apple would do something with that.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.440]   They have a lot of camera freaks there, they even have a Nokia camera.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:04.960]   That's part of what they're getting by having such a hefty processor inside that machine.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.040]   They don't have to necessarily beef up the lens. They don't necessarily have to beef up the sensor.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.960]   They can just simply say, we have enough. We can take five pictures in a really fast period of time
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:22.000]   and then we can combine them in interesting ways that will totally remove all forms of ISO
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.760]   grain. We can do synthetic sharpness. We can do synthetic,
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:33.920]   wide dynamic range. There's so much they can do. I mean, my Android phone is not a particularly
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   good one, but it's not a bad one, but it's not a particularly good one. The camera is very average,
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.360]   but then Google pushed out an update to their camera app that really turbocharged their HDR
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.480]   mode so that it doesn't look like HDR at all. It's fast enough that you can use it as your
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:54.000]   default camera mode. Now it's fine that it's good enough that it will take a picture that is at
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.760]   least in the same ballpark as what an iPhone will take. It's even better once you take it back
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.080]   and put it into the Photos app or put it into Lightroom and do a little bit of tweaking to it.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.920]   And so that's really where the meat is. I like my Lumina 1020. I thought the 40 megapixel
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.200]   image sensor with a real flash were wonderful, wonderful things, but it's starting to look very
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.240]   clear that all you need is a decent sensor, probably from Sony, and then just simply add as much of
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.080]   the back end of that as possible because it doesn't matter what numbers come off the image sensor,
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.240]   what matters are the pixels that you put onto the screen afterward.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.160]   Mm hmm. Such a nice camera.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.320]   Still eight megapixels or will they?
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.960]   Yeah, I love it. I sometimes carry that yellow camera on just the 41 megapixels.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.760]   Yeah, it's huge. Yeah. And it works. The damn thing works. It's not like a gimmick.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.960]   I still think my Galaxy S6 eats it.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.480]   So the sampling is great because you're taking all those megapixels, but no one really needs
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.360]   that big effect. It's all the information to down-sample. Yeah.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.600]   Well, but again, even that was an interesting tweak. They weren't necessarily promoting it
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.920]   as a 40 megapixel camera. They're promoting it as here is a 40 megapixel.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:05.120]   Basically, how about if you had a digital zoom feature that actually worked where you could
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.000]   cut out an eight megapixel section of this that is as good as what an iPhone would shoot natively.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.920]   Only you didn't have to get quite that close to the line cage of the zoo to get that picture.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.800]   Safety from lions on the new.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.000]   Yeah. Well, and I'm always excited about the new camera because whatever they do with the camera
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.080]   in every new phone always ends up being better in low light. And I like to take a lot of pictures
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.440]   that are not necessarily in the full sunshine of day. And I live in Portland where there is not
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.960]   a lot of full sunshine period. So, dear, for me, that's the thing that's always exciting is the
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:46.160]   low light stuff. And being able to get a picture, still get a useful photo that I would not necessarily
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.680]   have been able to get before. And now that I've had enough of these phones, I can scroll back
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.360]   through my iPhoto library because that's where I was keeping them. And I can see, like, oh,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.120]   I took that picture with the 3G. I can tell repeatedly which one that was.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.680]   And for Apple, I mean, the camera is what drives upgrades. If they want people to upgrade iPhones
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:10.000]   faster, I think everybody now, this is the smartphone. We might as well call it a smart camera
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.640]   with some phone capabilities. It's a camera that makes phone calls. Like, that's all mine is.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.360]   Yeah. Well, I don't think you're alone in that. I will say, though, that I think that Apple's now
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.120]   at a point with the iPhone where they have to increase the megapixel count.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.680]   It's because there are other, there's no shortage of other phones that take much higher resolution
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.720]   pictures that are equally comparable to what an iPhone can take. Only with the iPhone, you don't
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.160]   have the ability to crop it in a meaningful way and still have something that can fill a screen.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.880]   I don't think it's a bad camera. I don't think it's a chintzy camera, but there was a time where
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.120]   there was an aggressively correct statement to be made that, look, we're not in the megapixel
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.720]   wars. We're in the take great pictures wars, but now everyone else seems to have caught up.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.440]   And now you're getting 12 and 16 megapixel sensors that take great pictures that are,
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.200]   if you put them aside, if they're not necessarily 100% as good as what's in an iPhone 6,
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.880]   they're so good that if you took a series of 10 pictures and 10 different locales,
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.800]   the iPhone would not necessarily win every single blind comparison test.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.360]   And so starting to look as though it would be nice to have more ability to crop down and more
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.640]   detail in these pictures. Let's take a break. Will we come back? Lots more to talk about.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.480]   It's really fun to have you here. Kelly, thanks for joining us from a Kelly Gumont
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:37.120]   Gumont. I don't know how to say that verse. So that's all I need to say at macobserver.com.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:44.640]   Her first time on. So please be gentle. I'm just teasing. Renee Richie, who is never gentle.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.440]   In fact, he almost strangled me the last time I saw him.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.240]   That was a bit of a voluntary. I volunteered for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.280]   And if I recall, I think you were choking me. I think it was the other way around. In fact,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.240]   I remember your friend saying, how could you let Leo do that incredibly dangerous hold?
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.280]   I have trust in Leo. You did. Because I, you know, you tapped. He said, if I tap,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.880]   you stop and you tap me and almost didn't stop. You tapped a good five, 10 minutes after I
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:16.400]   cracked up. I almost didn't stop. So kind of special episode of 50 Shades of Twit. It was really bad
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.960]   had I killed Renee Richie on our New Year's Eve special. That would have been bad.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:28.720]   Also with us, Mr. Andy Inletko of the Chicago Sun Times. It's always a pleasure to have all of
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:35.040]   you here for Mac break weekly. We've been talking about getting a new device. The key to getting
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.560]   the new device is getting rid of the old device. Not throwing it in a drawer. You wouldn't throw
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.600]   a $100 bill in a drawer. Just let it gather dust. I bet you that $100 bill you spend that
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:49.840]   fast. Gazelle is ready to throw $100 bills at you in effect. Go to Gazelle.com, get quotes
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:59.200]   on your devices. Find out what they're worth. They've paid out over $200 million at Gazelle.com,
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:08.080]   over a million customers with really strong customer satisfaction. You can sell iPhones and
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.120]   iPads. They even buy broken iPhones and iPads. They'll also buy tablets from other manufacturers

[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   maybe you'll get Kelly's iPhone 5S. You're looking for a really good deal. They are certified,
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.320]   two conditions, certified like new. That's pretty self-explanatory.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.400]   Certified good. They're going to show some gentle signs of wear. But you will save,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.640]   of course, more money. Everything that Gazelle sells has gone through their rigorous 30-point

[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.640]   those prices are guaranteed for 30 days. That's nice too. Gives you the time to get the new thing
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:39.280]   and all that. Gazelle.com. I want the new iPad soon, but I guess it's probably, we're going to
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.160]   probably wait till fall. It'll be like the normal release. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.560]   So my boss just messaged me that he's shaved his arm to take photographs of his Apple watch
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.160]   because he's sick and tired of everyone with hairy arms taking photographs of their Apple watch.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.000]   I know, it's kind of gross. But all these hairy arms. I don't think I have shaved arms.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.440]   That might be. And by the way, Kudos to Serenity Caldwell, who was the first to identify the tattoo
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:07.280]   issue, which Apple has acknowledged. And everybody quoted her research without giving her credit.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.520]   Well, the thing with Serenity that I find is awesome is a lot of people just report that.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.000]   Say Apple doesn't work with tattoos. She actually went out and tested it and said it will work with
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.120]   these, not with this. This is what you have to look for. These are the workarounds.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.000]   She did the work. Yes. Is she sleeved? No, but her boyfriend is.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:33.920]   She had a great tweet and says, honey, can I put my watch on my wrist and take pictures?
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.400]   These are the costs of dating. I borrow your wrist. Does he shave his arm for those pictures?
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.680]   No, I think he's like that. But Kevin just told I'm going to check his Instagram feed in a minute,
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.520]   but he's just shaved his arm. So wow, they're the pictures started. All right. All right.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.840]   What's his Instagram? He's going to be better off. I guarantee it.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.880]   Kevin K-E-V-I-N.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.040]   I'm I-C-H-A-L-U-K.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.640]   I'm I-C-H-A-L-U-K.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:07.680]   I'll tell you what, he may be OK with it now, but in two days.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.720]   Oh, it's going to itch. It's going to itch so bad.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:16.400]   I know how that is, don't you? He didn't shave his arm. They're all airy.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.160]   That one hasn't maybe uploaded or not yet, but I'm staring at his latest picture.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.040]   Oh, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.640]   It's more aerodynamic now, I guess.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.880]   I think he needs to go with laser treatments.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.040]   Oh, that would be good way too.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.560]   Yeah, be nice and smooth.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.680]   Or a sandblaster.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:37.840]   Well, he's a big watch fanatic. He has a bunch of panorise and enomegas and data and like,
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.800]   Rolex is.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.320]   So I'm following Kevin Rose's watch ville on Instagram.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.200]   I think a lot of these risks are, I'm going to ask Kevin if he's going to shave his wrist.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.960]   Oh, he said he just posted the picture of his wrist.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.000]   All right. I'll go back.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.320]   But see what see, these are beautiful watches, but I agree, you get a little bit distracted
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.720]   by the hair, by the hair.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.640]   Although it looks like Kevin's like wearing.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.200]   See that? That's kind of gross.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.920]   That's kind of gross. I don't want to see that.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.360]   I don't. Yeah. Yeah. Close up of hair.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.560]   There. Let me put it on a leaf.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.600]   Probably the app watches you have to have it on a wrist.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.280]   Otherwise, you know, it's non-functional.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.480]   Well, it's not non-functional, but it.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.360]   You've got a pin code.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.680]   It asks you for pin codes every three seconds. Yeah.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.440]   Here's Kevin actually assembling a Audemars Begay
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.880]   watch. He's going to be on the screensavers for this Saturday, the new screensavers.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.520]   Talking watches. All right. So, so,
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.960]   your, your Kevin has asked go back.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.640]   A lot of Kevin's and watches. I wonder if that's a thing.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.280]   Must be if your name is Kevin, there it is.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   Oh, God, that's worse.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.720]   No, Kevin, that was a bad idea, grow.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.400]   I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have it handy.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.840]   No pun intended, but a couple of years ago, as a, like,
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.960]   as a way to get me to open a box with a PR thing and as someone said,
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.480]   a company sent me like a Halloween store, like zombie head and a
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.000]   Halloween store, like severed arm.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:06.480]   Yeah, arm.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.240]   But I, and I gave away the head, but I took, but I kept the arm,
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.160]   thankfully, because now I use it every time I need to, like, photograph or test out a watch.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.120]   It's now, as now as strapped to the severed arm.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.720]   I have, I now decided I prefer fur.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:29.280]   Oh, yes. That is crackberry Kevin now, no longer wearing a blackberry watch.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.000]   Oh, interesting.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.200]   Sad times.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.880]   Did they have a watch the blackberry watch?
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.800]   Yeah, the impulse, the watch that Eric,
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.440]   which coffee made before he made the pebble was the blackberry impulse.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.400]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.080]   Huh.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.800]   Oh, the rich history of connected watches.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.480]   So I'm sorry, back to the, the 12.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.680]   To Wookiee's wearing watches.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   12. Yeah, Wookiee's wearing watches.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.960]   See if you're Wookiee. It's okay.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.360]   Some of us are a little bit hair suit, Leo.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.080]   That's just how it is.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:54.640]   We're all.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.920]   Well, it turns out men are actually have hairy arms.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.520]   And who knew?
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.080]   I haven't spent much time looking at it.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.920]   I have, I have, I ever thought of myself as hairy, but I am actually,
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.240]   it looks like Robin Williams down there.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.360]   A baby Sasquatch.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.400]   Baby Sasquatch.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.880]   So now I don't know, but I think it's preferable to raise your bumps.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.640]   Don't you?
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.200]   Probably.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:19.920]   Yeah, maybe laser.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.480]   I don't know.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.760]   Or tach, just get the sleeve.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.440]   Or wax, like.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.880]   Tatch, tach, you are on that.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.120]   Wait, Jason Hall is flicking back and forth.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.400]   A little A/B comparison.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.160]   That's more from the horn.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.960]   Let's please.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   12.2 inch iPad available this fall with force touch, right?
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.760]   The one of the rumors is Type C connected.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.440]   That would make me really happy.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.040]   It's interesting because, you know, as much as people don't like this idea,
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.680]   the lightning team was integral to developing Type C.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.720]   And if you look at it, it's a very lightning like connector.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.280]   And whether it gives Apple everything it wants to get out,
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.320]   of because the Type C connector doesn't do everything that lightning does.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:01.840]   Lightning is auto-reassignable and it can carry many more types of signals.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.640]   So it would limit sort of the amount of data and the types of data
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.680]   and the versatility of what you could pull off of the iPad.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.720]   But if it's big enough, maybe Type C and lightning, or maybe they could do.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.840]   That was one rumor I heard was Type C and lightning.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:14.880]   I like.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.320]   Does anyone remember the riots in the streets when they went from 30
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.840]   pindle lightning in the first place?
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.000]   Yes, that was me.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.280]   You really not think this is another torch in pitchfork situation.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.240]   I was carrying that torch.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:24.400]   Yep.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.320]   I was very upset because I didn't want to buy all new connectors
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.720]   and docks and stuff like that.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.920]   Well, remember we had the 30 pin for what, like 10 years?
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.400]   Right.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.480]   Like actually 10 years or something.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:42.400]   So by the time they had finally settled on it, so yeah, it'd be a rough transition.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.600]   Now my house is saturated.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.480]   That's the thing is lightning, but now I have to see.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.280]   They're going to have a real problem on their hands.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.600]   If they sell a truly solid 12 and a half, 13 inch iPad,
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.960]   that can only be described as one that's for professional use.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.760]   And they still say, by the way, getting files on and off this is still going to be a
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.520]   rough night in hell unless you're trying to get files to and from it from another Apple device.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.520]   It's going to give you access to the file system.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.360]   We're still not going to let you plug anything into it.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.360]   We're still not going to let you have memory cards on it.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.320]   That's going to be a real.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.480]   So why the hell am I trying to buy this thing?
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.440]   It's nice.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.360]   It's nice if the only thing that I ever take pictures with is my phone.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.880]   It's nice if the only place I ever get files from is from my cloud,
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.760]   but there are times where even on my Android phone,
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.600]   there have been times where the fact that I can simply attach any USB device to it
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.840]   and get access to the files has been a lifesaver.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.960]   Fortunately, you don't need your lifesaved every single day or every single month,
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.080]   but there are times in the year where you're dead unless something saves your life
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.680]   and you're glad that you had that lifesaver.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.040]   Which would be a fast term, the new MacBook or the new
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.760]   pewtitive faster in what way.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.160]   I personally think that the Apple's chipsets at that low power
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.040]   and that size are more interesting than Intel's,
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.600]   but Intel provides a huge amount of compatibility.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.120]   To Andy's point though, what's so exciting for me is you look at what Apple's done now
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.920]   and they basically have backboard and springboard running on the Apple TV,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.720]   on the iPhone, on the iPad, and on the Apple Watch.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.440]   And you have, I don't know if it's still called front row on the Apple TV,
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.200]   but then you have springboard on the iPhone and iPad and you have carousel on the Apple Watch,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.560]   but they're all the same foundation.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:22.480]   And it makes me wonder if you could have that foundation on an iPad Pro,
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.600]   maybe eventually any iPad, and have a different layer on top,
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.760]   a layer that allows you to do more things,
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.320]   but doesn't sacrifice the simplicity that lets our parents' favorite computer ever,
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.240]   but for people like Andy or people who do want to make better use of that hardware.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.200]   Not just a file system, but an iPad OS, the same way we have watch OS,
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.080]   where whatever it's named, it would just be a deeper, richer experience.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.800]   Because they cut down a lot, they trimmed down a lot for the Apple Watch,
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:52.240]   why not expand up a bit for a larger glass surface?
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.600]   It could, I do that.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.160]   You could give you an iOS file system and stuff.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.840]   Well, you'd have to add some things to make it a better value proposition.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.200]   You can't, if Apple felt as though it made sense for them to simply make
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.920]   another iPad, only make it a bigger one, they would have done it already.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.480]   Right.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.360]   I think that if they're making a 13-inch iPad,
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   it's because here's an opportunity that we can prosecute,
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.320]   that we can't prosecute with a 9.7-inch iPad Air right now.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.080]   But it is an interesting calculus because now you're basically saying,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.000]   here is a really, not just a Windows notebook with a touch tablet,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.280]   but a really nicely made one, one that can really be your complete travel computer without
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.160]   making any adjustments whatsoever, assuming you're running Windows,
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.080]   but if you're on planet Earth, you're likely to be running Windows instead of Mac OS.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.280]   And here's for the exact same amount of money, hypothetically,
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.640]   here is a 12.9-inch iPad with some limitations.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.720]   And you have to basically ask some, but you have to figure out how somebody is going to be making
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.160]   that judgment. If it has some of the other features that are being rumored,
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.680]   like actual true pressure sensitivity, really tight integration with a Bluetooth pressure sensitive
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:03.680]   stylus, there's the argument to be made that it wouldn't be a competition to anyone's notebooks,
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.320]   not even apples. It would be for the artist who really needs to communicate visually and in an
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:12.560]   analog fashion that you can do things with pressure sensitivity and a large screen that you could
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.440]   not do with no pressure sensitivity and an i.7-inch screen.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:20.720]   There are very few other products that Apple has on the dartboard right now that I can't imagine
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.440]   they have so much flexibility on. If they decide for themselves, here is the sort of person that
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.760]   we're marketing to. Here's the sort of need we're trying to fulfill. They could make that 12.9-inch
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.600]   tablet do pretty much whatever they want to do. So it's going to be a nice surprise to think
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:39.760]   everybody whenever it ships. I like the idea of both Type C and Lightning, but it doesn't feel
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.320]   like an appily thing to do. And if you type C, then they go Type C and the phones too, right?
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:50.400]   They did. Remember that the AR-2 does not have the really useful mechanical switch on the side
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:58.800]   that lets you lock the screen rotation. I've not spoken to anybody with knowledge that has told me
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:05.760]   of any functional reason why they took that off. Which leaves me with at least the hypothesis
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.680]   that they just thought it was a piece of clutter that was not necessary, that was duplicated by
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.440]   software. And if it's possible to remove clutter, you want to remove clutter.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:19.920]   So you're right that I find it hard to imagine them willfully putting two data points,
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.880]   the two data points which duplicate so much of each other's functionality.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.800]   Could you just put an adapter, a lightning adapter?
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.120]   Lightning to USB-C adapter. The interesting thing about the USB-C, the problem with
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.360]   Thunderbolt was that it's PCI architecture and iOS devices except for a little bit of stuff in
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.960]   the comms component doesn't use PCI architecture. But USB-C doesn't really care.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.360]   It does have a beautiful piece of PCI.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.040]   Type C is a beautiful thing. Speaking of beautiful things, here's Marcus Marietta.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.440]   Is this the first Beatz ad?
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.640]   Marcus Mariota.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.080]   This is the first-
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:54.640]   He's a local guy.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.240]   No, yeah, let's get it right. He's from-
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.960]   Inpeccable.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.600]   Portlandia.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.240]   Well, he played for Oregon.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.600]   Ah, he's a duck.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.000]   Yeah, he was a duck. Well, he was a duck until he was a Titan.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.760]   From duck to Titan.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.640]   I think he's too drafted now.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.360]   Second overall pick was Titan.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.120]   And he owes it all to his Beats headphones and his amazing sculpted pecs.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.920]   Okay, I had a terrible Beats headphones experience on Sunday because somebody-
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.960]   This person sitting two or three seats away from me on the red line on the tee was wearing
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.920]   Beats headphones and they're cheap and they're craply made and they're incredibly leaky.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.440]   And I know that that person had the music turned up all the way, but I swear to God,
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.000]   it was too loud for even my ears to deal with, even though I was sitting two seats away.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.600]   And I spent like 20 minutes of that ride looking over to my left and seeing that Beats logo on the
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.320]   side of those crappy cheap leaky headphones and saying, "I hate Beats and I hate whatever
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.480]   cover-" Oh damn, Apple owns Beats.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:54.960]   Oops.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.880]   I don't hate Apple and I still hate Beats.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.720]   So here's the depth of my knowledge on the Beats headphones.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:09.200]   Aside from Marcus Mario to doing sit-ups, is that they were being made in one place.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.280]   There was one particular company that had been-
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.240]   Monster made them.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:12.720]   -conch-out just made a factor.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.520]   Initially, Monster made them and made very good ones.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:22.720]   Then Beats decided probably for financial reasons to make them themselves and didn't make very good ones.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.960]   See, I heard it was the other way that they started out crap and then people realized,
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.560]   "I'm paying $300 for these headphones and their crap," and then they started to suck less.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   So I probably have to either way.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.080]   But I don't worry.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.560]   Now, by the way, I talked to Neil Young yesterday.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.320]   It's a good triangulation for the chips to watch it.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:38.800]   -That was awesome.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.080]   -And he said, "When I want more bass, I listen to Beats."
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.120]   But I think that's a tip of the head to Jimmy Iovine or something.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   -In age of Ultron, Bruce Banner is using Beats.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.960]   And I think that's the last thing you'd put on the Hulk, right?
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:53.280]   -Yeah.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   -You don't want that drive bass anywhere in your band.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:55.760]   -Yeah.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.960]   So that's a Beats head, a Honda celebrating one of them.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.760]   -You don't want good headphones so that he's going to break anyway.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.080]   -Yeah.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:02.560]   -That's true.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.520]   -You want stretchy.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.240]   -Yeah.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.440]   -Can you get green beats?
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.040]   -Yes.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.000]   -That'll be a tie, and I hope.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.760]   -The on-ear you can.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.160]   The thing I thought was interesting about the Marcus Mario to add is that
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.320]   they use his friends and family as the narration.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.360]   -That's beautiful.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.320]   -It's really quite beautiful.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.520]   -The reason it's really great.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:19.920]   I love it.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.320]   He's from Hawaii and he played football in Oregon.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.400]   The thing that I thought was really interesting about it was that
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.000]   this ad dropped the day the NFL draft started.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   And so this ad was already live before Marcus Mario to have been drafted for anybody.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.520]   So nobody knew from nobody at Beats knew that he was the number two overall NFL pick.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.480]   -They just picked up.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.920]   -We can sports with a girl.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.800]   -They know the new words.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.000]   -That's true.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.120]   -Lisa schools me and the NFL every single day.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.080]   -Well, mostly I'm a basketball girl, but he's local,
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.120]   so there's been a truckload of coverage about Marcus Mario to,
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.160]   especially because he came up to Nike, which is just over there.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.960]   So anyway, the thing I thought was interesting about it was the timing of the ad,
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.320]   because they had to go put the whole thing together and have it ready to go,
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.960]   and then released it before he was picked.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.800]   So everybody knew he was going to be a high pick.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.600]   Nobody knew it was going to be number two, but everybody figured he was going to be,
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   you know, for having given up his last year of college eligibility to go be in the NFL draft.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.800]   I thought it was very interesting that Beats put this out because like they already had the
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.760]   deal with him and it didn't matter where he ended up playing.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.240]   And they still were going to know this.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.560]   -So in the chatroom, incidentally, is saying that the new, you are right, Kelly.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.200]   The new Beats, the new studios are quite good.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   It was the older Beats, the monster-made Beats that were not so good.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.520]   -The thing I thought was interesting about the headphones specifically,
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.400]   since this is an ad for these wireless headphones that are the new thing they're trying to promote,
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.960]   is that you can adjust the cord on the back of them.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.920]   -Yeah, he showed that, yeah.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.200]   -To make them fit a little bit better.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:57.840]   -Yeah, that's nice.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.360]   -I have never had a good experience with wireless headphones like that,
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.000]   so I am very curious about these now.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.120]   If nothing else, I would like to find out more about the fit on these.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.680]   And I think since they're Beats, they would be part of the Apple
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.560]   headphone try-on thing that you can do in the stores now.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.760]   -Do I have a car, but I haven't seen them in the stores.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.920]   We are still waiting for Apple to launch a Beats-based music service,
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.160]   although the FTC, the Department of Justice,
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.280]   say they're looking into the fact that Apple's pushing aggressively
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.160]   to get the music labels to turn off free Spotify streaming.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.920]   It was the free streaming that Taylor Swift didn't like on Spotify.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.320]   A reason she pulled 1989 from Spotify.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.760]   I guess Beats won't have a free tier?
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.200]   What's the deal here?
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.240]   -The problem here is that you can't make up free on volume.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.760]   There's got to be some money at the end of the pipe.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:02.000]   -But C-App was in a unique position because they sell hardware.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.840]   If anybody could make money on free, it would be Apple.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.440]   -It's hard for Apple to get deals, especially hard in the post-itunes days,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.120]   for Apple to get deals because everyone's concerned
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.280]   that they're going to come in and take over the market and take control.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.120]   The terms that they're often asked for are not always the same as other companies.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.640]   One of the things that they're pitching is we can help you build a sustainable business
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.040]   because no one wants to ... We remember this with all the plays for sure.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.880]   I think it was called or services where they ended up just shutting down.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.120]   There wasn't enough business for them.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   In my world, it would be great if there was some sort of free tier or cheap tier,
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.680]   and then people who really want high quality, or they find something
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.840]   something that was value added that was worth paying for.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:46.160]   But the overall amount is a lot of services where a few people who are willing to pay for more
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.640]   can afford to subsidize everybody on that service.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.040]   If they can reach that balance, that kind of an offering, I think that would be good for them.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.520]   -I don't think it has to do with making money.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:59.280]   I think ... Well, ultimately, it always does, but I don't think it has to do with the fact
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.560]   they can't monetize free.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.920]   I think it has more to do with if you can kill the free tier on these other networks,
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.960]   you have a shot at moving people to beats, the paid beats.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.240]   If they're going to move to paid, then beats is now in the mix.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.440]   That's the problem beats has.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.280]   It's so late to the game that they were not able to garner many listeners
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.480]   who had already chosen one of the other competitors.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.800]   But there are still a majority of listeners on Spotify and everywhere else do not pay.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.880]   If you kill the free tier, you suddenly free all those people to come to beats.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.720]   I think it's a very cynical move.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.400]   -Well, I don't know about cynical.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.240]   It's very complicated.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.160]   I've spent the past day trying to find out how the industry is actually ...
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:44.560]   They don't believe that giving away a product for free is in their long-term best interest.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:49.440]   They haven't been trying to kill any of the free deals, any of the free services,
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.680]   because of course they have to make those deals, nor those services to actually exist.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.920]   But they're looking for something that's better.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.680]   There's one argument to be made that's simply Apple saying,
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.720]   "We know you hate this.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.080]   We don't think this is a good idea.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:07.040]   Either we can help you to build into a model that will always ...
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:12.640]   There's always money coming into somebody's pocket every time that something streams.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.720]   But you're also correct in that Apple's got nothing.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.000]   They got nothing.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.040]   All they have is potential here, where Spotify is the FM radio of a couple of different
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.160]   generations right now.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.680]   And the majority of those users use that service because it's free.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.480]   So if Apple were to simply take away what a lot of people feel to be is the most handy feature of
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:37.120]   Pandora, of Spotify, of YouTube, of all these other movie channels,
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.080]   suddenly you're basically draining the water from the tanks of every competitor
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.760]   so that your boat will maybe float a little bit higher on the water compared to
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.840]   everybody that you're going to be shooting against in the future.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.400]   The big question that would remain though is that,
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.240]   "Okay, so magically we've got your magic ... The Music History has their magic wand,
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.160]   and now it's impossible to get music for free.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.800]   Does that mean, well, I guess I have no choice, but I'm going to start spending
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.240]   eight dollars a month for the Apple Music Service or for other paid services?
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.040]   Or do they simply say, "Well, I guess I'm going to spend the next
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.520]   23 minutes learning how to download music illegally?"
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.000]   Oh, well.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.960]   And I think there's a really important thing here and that is that
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.040]   if I were a free ... Well, I am. I'm a free Spotify user.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.640]   And if Free Tier went away, if I was going to pay for something,
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.200]   I would probably pay for Spotify because I'm already there.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.640]   Ah, okay.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.120]   So inertia, I think, is powerful.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.840]   But you have an iPhone with the Beats Music Service already installed.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.440]   There's a shot. I think this is what I call it deeply.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.560]   Yeah, but if I'm going to...
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.080]   It would just be in the Music app.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.520]   I don't know if it would be a Beats app.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.080]   Also, like someone like Kelly's, if they were to simply sign up for Beats
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.120]   because it's built in, they lose all the equity they've built over the past two or three or four years.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.720]   Also, they know how it works.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.800]   That you really got to push somebody away from something that they've been using for a while,
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.080]   that they like and that to their frame of reference works just fine.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.520]   Beats, by the way, is bundled into a number of Android phones, including,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.240]   I think the Galaxy S6 can't beat on it.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.840]   So the other thing about it is that the people, first of all,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.200]   the people I know who do pay are paying for Spotify.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.600]   I know people who have it for free, but everyone, I think everyone I know
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.440]   who is paying for it, who's paying for streaming, is paying for Spotify.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.360]   Well, meet somebody who uses Google All Access.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.480]   Yeah, me too.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.360]   Oh, gosh. Okay.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.240]   So that's two people.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.920]   But the other thing about this that I think is sort of odd is I feel like there's a piece of this
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.960]   story that we're missing because we already know that Apple has a trigger, happy antitrust
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.360]   monitor, breathing down its neck all the live long day.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:48.400]   So how something like this could even be discussed in a conference room somewhere in
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.280]   Cupertino is beyond me, honestly.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.640]   I feel like there's an important piece of this that we're not hearing, whether it's,
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.960]   somebody is taking something out of context or somebody is drawing the worst conclusion
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.880]   and set it to somebody somewhere else and that that's where this is coming from.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.800]   Because it's not a full investigation yet.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.280]   The impression I've gotten from what I've read so far is that there's sort of some,
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.080]   we're going to come around and ask some questions and kind of see if we can figure out
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.120]   what's really happening, then figure out if that's a problem.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.680]   It kind of feels like if anything shady was going on,
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.880]   the Rainbow Bridge would open and judge Denise Carte with her gavel would appear
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.440]   Thor-like.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.240]   No kidding.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.200]   Cupertino.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.920]   Yeah. See, and that's totally like, you know,
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.080]   the like they've got the jerky home monitor following everybody around looking for the
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.520]   slightest infraction already.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.960]   At the same, at the same time what they're looking with the investigators are looking for is
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.120]   not app is an apple wanting to change the rules for everybody.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.760]   It's wanting them to change the rules for themselves.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.680]   So if they simply tell these tell, if they were to insist to put to the,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.760]   to the music industry that look, we are not going to, we are the one of the largest music
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.280]   retailers, we refuse to carry your stuff unless you, unless you offer apple better terms than
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.640]   everybody else or that you stop offering this product to competitors that we don't like,
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.600]   that will get them in trouble.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.800]   But if they simply, if they simply sit them down and say, here is the,
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.120]   here is the world of music as we understand it.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.640]   And we don't see a future in which any artist or any label can make money if so long as there's
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.120]   any place where people can stream music for free.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.800]   And if Sony says, you know what, you got a point there, I think that you,
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.920]   and because you're, because I believe in this world that you're creating,
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:30.640]   I'm voluntarily deciding that I'm, we're going to end or start to not renegotiate these contracts.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.040]   That's a lot if you're, and given the amount of, again, given that they are, they are apple,
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.280]   but they are starting from zero on this new music service, given the upside to finding it out,
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:45.600]   maybe at the worst case, finding it out in court for a little bit while at worst case,
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.400]   that's certainly a conversation that's worthy of, of apples time.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.960]   But they're not necessarily starting from nothing.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.680]   I mean, the surface is at zero right now. That's true.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.520]   But they're starting with Jimmy Iveyne in their back pocket.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.960]   And Jimmy Ivey is a guy with a super ultra mega Rolodex.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.960]   Like even people who aren't necessarily people know the same.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.880]   It's so funny how apple people, but they're the incantation.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.960]   There's two incantations. Jimmy Ioween's Rolodex, all those credit cards, I don't buy it.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.560]   I don't think that gives a bunch of a head start.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.640]   All of my, my, my, but it does.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.280]   So you go ahead. I'm sorry. Completely thought.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   I was going to, I was about to trust your journey.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.360]   Well, I'll, I'll, I'm saying that those are incredibly strong assets that apple can,
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.240]   and apple's very, very good on following through and make again, they're, they're,
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.400]   they're very good at having that conversation saying, here's the world as we see it.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.920]   And we believe that we can all have a really great future, but here are the,
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.240]   here are the things that we don't think are going to work for any of us.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.280]   They're, that's another factor that's really, really in their favor.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.640]   But to the person who I've got my Spotify subscription, I like it, I use it.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.120]   I'm not going to care. There's a, there's a limit to,
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.400]   there are a limit to what Ioween can do to make that user decide I'm going to stop using this
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.560]   thing that I really, really like. And I'm going to switch to something else entirely.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.640]   They would have to come, they'd have to figure out what Spotify is doing wrong that I hate as a
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.240]   user that I've always, I've always wished, wished, wished that someone would come up with
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.640]   some of the service that's better in these three ways.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.680]   If Clap in the music industry made a difference, title would be rolling over everybody.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.920]   And it's not. It's not.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.520]   But I don't, I don't know that.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.600]   Jay Z is, has as much influence, I would argue more than Jimmy Ioween.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.400]   And he's still not able to make title work.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:33.200]   But I think there's a certain amount of it that is just, um, Jimmy Ioween has the ability to get
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.040]   people in a room. And when they initially launched the iTunes store, they didn't have that.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.880]   They didn't have anybody. They were just,
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:44.480]   Steve Jobs. We're Apple and we, they had Steve Jobs who had more clout than anybody.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.240]   That's true, but he wasn't a music guy. And Jimmy Ioween is at least a music guy.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.360]   He can get the right people in the room together to have a conversation.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.520]   How that conversation goes is not up to him.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:58.400]   The music industry is filled with a bunch of guys who just want to make money.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.040]   They don't give a damn about anybody's rolodex. They're going to do what makes the most money for
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.160]   them. And that's why Apple can go to them and say, you guys should really not go to the free
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.760]   tiers. You should not allow your albums on the free tiers. That's bad.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.800]   Although there's spiteful people who don't always put money first on their journey.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.320]   No, they're also evil. I do. I do think there's also, I do think there's also a factor in that.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:28.960]   If if Sony or any other music publisher felt as though they were about to hand Apple and even
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.000]   bigger stick that Apple can beat them with, they would say that's that's not a good long-term thing
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.640]   for right. This actually might be I think I do believe sincerely that inside these music companies,
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.800]   there's conversations saying maybe this is a good chance for us to actually consider about
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.200]   retrenching with Spotify retrenching and with free services because if we essentially give
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.160]   Apple a tool that we think will help them to kill off competitors, they're not going to say,
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.200]   you know what? Now that we're number one and now that we've killed off all competition,
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.120]   guess what? We're going to negotiate an even better deal for you. So you get to keep even more money.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.680]   It's going to be we'd like some input over your album art designs because
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.640]   they just don't do good with our design guidelines. All right, we're going to move on.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:19.440]   A couple of quickies before we get to your picks of the week. What do you think of this
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:25.040]   Microsoft big play last week telling iOS developers, hey, with just a few simple tweaks,
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:31.440]   you can get your Apple, your Apple app on the Windows phone. Isn't that exciting?
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.520]   It helps. It doesn't offer additional value yet. So until they can show that it's really valuable
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.520]   for you to spend even less time porting. It's going to be hard. I don't understand why they think
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.840]   that Android or iOS developers will be interested. I guess because you could write a universal app,
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.320]   which would then be and this is by the way, what we're going to do with then would be Windows 10
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:55.520]   Windows phone and Xbox. I disagree for certain developers. There's a conversation you can have
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.880]   that is very compelling, which is Sir and Madam, there is a bag of free money on the floor right
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.840]   there. It's not a life change to go on money, but it is free money. All you have to do is spend
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.400]   exactly 38 seconds picking it up. And now you will have this free money. If you can make that
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.640]   choice to a certain offer to a certain amount of people saying if we can basically detail
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:19.920]   some people for a day and a half to suddenly make some have a presence in the Microsoft store,
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.200]   if it's that easy, it doesn't matter that they're not really adding features to it. Although it is
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.600]   possible for them to simply add things like Xbox live features to their code apps.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.120]   It's better for games, I think. It's better for games because again, that's the free money
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:41.280]   proposition to me. There's also a native UI that you have to worry about. And the split attention
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.320]   thing isn't as big a deal in games. The bigger problem for me is that you don't have the when
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.400]   you basically say here's user same code and recycle it for multiple different platforms.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.000]   You're basically saying don't improve it to take advantage of what Android can do,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.640]   but iOS can't or what iOS can do that Windows can't. You're basically saying let's have the same
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.480]   sort of bland triscuit with the off-brand peanut butter on top of it and never do something better
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:14.080]   than that. So that's a difficulty. Remember when American Airlines gave all the pilots' iPads
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.800]   because the pilots were getting sore shoulders, carrying around these giant bags with all their
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.480]   flight maps and their manifests and all that stuff. And they were literally getting injuries.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.880]   Well, I don't know what went wrong. That wasn't an iPad story. The company that makes the app that
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.600]   shows them the flight plans pushed bad code. Yeah, the app was bad. That's sort of like the
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.840]   binder had a bad photocopy job and they shoved a bunch of bad photocopies into the binder. You
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:47.680]   can't really blame the binder. The ring broke is not the same thing as the Med. Yeah. Well, this
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.600]   isn't even the ring breaking. I mean, the iPad was perfectly fine. It's the iPad bad code. And
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:55.520]   to their company's credit, I can't pronounce their name. They took responsibility. Yeah, and they fixed
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.760]   it. I believe Jepsen and they fixed it. It's a ground quite a few flights for a moment. The
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.040]   pilots get on say, our iPad's broken. So Jepsen said it was less than it gets grounded during a
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:08.320]   typical thunderstorm. But you know, I don't, you know, it's their best. That could be hundreds.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:15.360]   That could be hundreds. Yeah. But I actually, um, I worked with a pilot at one point who was doing
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:23.360]   this. And, um, he said at one point that there was that he was somebody who used this Jepsen stuff.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:29.600]   The hard copy version of the map information. And he said, uh, they keep talking about putting it
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.680]   online. This was a few years ago. And he said, they keep talking about putting it online. And
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.040]   if they were able to do that so that I could put it on an iPad and I didn't have to carry this
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:42.000]   Windows machine around with me and all of the paper, then I would do this in a heartbeat. And so
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.560]   then I said, you know, if they're giving you a PDF, you can read this on your iPad here. This is
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.680]   how you do it. And so then the next day he went and bought an iPad and he was like, I don't have
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.160]   to take this thing with me on the plane anymore. And that's awesome. So according to him,
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.280]   even though like the Jepsen app, you know, may have been bad, like for him, it's a better
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.920]   experience to be doing it on the iPad, even though it wasn't, you know, even though in this case,
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.200]   it was sort of a problem. Um, but he, uh, I actually get to see some of it, uh, that, because he
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.280]   showed me this is what I get to do now instead of having this Windows machine, that, that every
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.280]   time I, he said, I only open it when I'm on the plane. So as soon as I hit the tarmac, I have to
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.960]   open it up and make sure that it's got everything updated so that it doesn't try to restart in the
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.320]   middle of a flight. So not having to deal with any of that stuff to him, you know, I know that if
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.160]   I had sent him an email, he would have told me that this was completely a legitimate trade-off in
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:36.000]   his mind. Uh, it was one map for one airport. Uh, I want to say it was Reagan International.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:42.640]   Uh, it was that particular map that if you had requested it within a certain window,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:49.280]   it was giving you trouble. So overall, at least it's not like it was every map for Reagan or anything
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.880]   that happened. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And actually the fix was something every iPad owner is familiar
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.240]   with deleting the app and reinstalling it. Right. So you hold down the thing and you can
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:03.360]   jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. That's all your manifests. Everything is going away. And then you put it in
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:10.480]   the one and Jefferson, by the way, is a Boeing is owned by Boeing company airport 2015 passengers
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:17.680]   or Apple genius has fallen ill. Anybody know how to leave repair an iPad and come to the cockpit
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:25.360]   with me? It's a genius emergency. Oh, it's funny. Damn it. I quit because I couldn't stand the stress.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.800]   What makes you think that I'll be able to stand up to the stress today? I'm a genius, but not.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.280]   I can't answer that for you. What I can tell you is that there are 214 passengers on here
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:40.240]   that wants to know, can you reset and restart and put it into recovery mode without falling
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.480]   like a house of cards? Why are you going to tell them? Because I don't know what to tell them, sir.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.120]   Hey, I speak D F you. Oh, I was going to go with I speak SMS.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:46:00.480]   Well, at least we're all at the same wavelength. Let's take a break. Your picks of the week coming
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.720]   up in just a bit. I was thinking of shaving. You wouldn't mind if I shaved a little bit here.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.720]   I could use it, Leo. You need a shave. I want to get you some Harry's.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.880]   I will only shave with Harry's in case people think we're making this up. I got to tweet the other
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:21.040]   day yesterday. I think you can look at my tweet feed Twitter feed. Somebody said, you know,
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.640]   I've been hearing these ads about Harry's. I finally got it. I've never had a shave. This good.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.720]   It's it was amazing. Look, we got to shave everybody's shaves. You shave your arms,
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:31.840]   you shave your face. Maybe we should save send Kevin one of these.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.360]   Brilliant. No more razor bumps, Kevin.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.520]   But Harry's man, this is the place. So Harry, well, why is Harry's better? Well, a few things. First of
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:47.280]   all, they sell direct to you. They actually they make their own blades. They bought the factory in
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:51.760]   Germany. They asked when they first started, you know, where do you where do we get blades? We want
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:57.760]   to sell, you know, better blades. There's two factories in Germany in the whole world that make
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:02.160]   the best blades. So they bought one of them. They own it. Now their blades are engineered for
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.480]   performance and because they're selling direct to you, they're half the cost of a blade in the
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.440]   drugstore. Fusion blades, what about four bucks each? Harry's is half that. They deliver
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:18.800]   direct to you. And it all starts, by the way, with the Harry's kit. So and these are a great deal,
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:25.280]   too. I this is a Truman kit. You can get this online. Oh, that's a nice I like the orange handle.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:30.320]   They also have Winston's Truman kit's 15 bucks. Winston kit's 25 bucks with a metal handle.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:37.040]   But you get the handle, you get three Harry's blades. That's that's almost a month's worth,
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:40.960]   right? I change them. Actually, Harry's is so affordable now. I change my blades every few days
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.200]   because I love having a nice fresh blade. But you know, I'm the kind of guy that buys an Apple
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.480]   watch. So what do you expect? This is the travel. Whoops, the travel head. I love this. You can put
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.280]   it in your top kit. They don't mention this, but I always do. And of course, the Harry's
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.960]   gel, you can get the cream, which I use or the foaming shave gel. Now that's 15 bucks. But I
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.920]   mean, that's a great deal to get you started. And incidentally, we'll take five bucks off when
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.760]   you go to Harry's dot com and use our offer code Mac break. So now $10 with the Truman kit to get
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.000]   started. They come with four different colors and you can choose the cream or the foaming
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.400]   shave gel. I like the cream, but some people don't. So I guess you'd have to figure that out.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.200]   Harry's has some new stuff too. Look, I just got my this actually we need this in the house
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:30.320]   because Lisa has Harry's too. And she keeps stealing my razor. So I have a Harry's
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.400]   razor holder. Look at that. It's milled aluminum. It's beautiful. It's got my name on it. So there's
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.560]   never any question, you know, which razor Lisa stealing. She's stealing mine. There you go. Look
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.880]   at that. Isn't that nice? The unboxing is amazing. They said take such care in the package.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.720]   This is this is the apple of razor blade companies. I really think so. Look at this is it's an aluminum
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.360]   cube. It's gorgeous. And they have a little rubber rings that doesn't slide around on your
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.640]   and I thought I was packing the charger for my for my Apple watch. It turns out I just have my
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:12.720]   razor. Oh, shoot. H a R R Y S Harry's dot com. It is the best shave you'll ever get.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:18.320]   And I want you to start right now with $5 off when you use the offer code MAC break on your first
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:26.800]   order. Harry's dot com offer code MAC break. Kevin says he just used your code Leo. What good.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.320]   Kevin said he just used your heaven. You're going to love it. Get the cream. I think for your I think
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.240]   my suggestion if you're shaving your wrist is use the cream. Yes. I don't know why I just I
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.240]   like the cream. I think I think the reason that they start offering the fumbering shave gels because
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:45.680]   the cream is really thick. And people I think we're saying Oh, clogs up my blades, but I use super
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.200]   hot water and it immediately dissolves it all you can just run the head under the hot water.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.040]   And then it's such a smooth shave. You don't eat. I did it today. I haven't I've never cut myself
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:50:00.000]   once. It's like a hovercraft for your face. Leo, I keep going back to it. I love it.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.720]   All right. Let us let us do our picks of the week. I think we're going to let you start Kelly.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.720]   If you're ready, if you wanted, if you got one for us, all right. Well, my pick is going to be the
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:17.600]   app camp for girls app. Oh, let's do it. So tell us all about app camp for girls.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:24.880]   So app camp for girls is a thing that Jean McDonald started. We know her very well. Of course,
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:32.480]   she was for a long time at Smile software and a good friend. And she's wonderful. And she
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:37.840]   sat me down for lunch like I think three years ago now and said, I have this idea. And I said,
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.400]   awesome. What can I do? And she said, I didn't tell you my idea yet. And I said, it's your idea.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.480]   That's all I need to know. So just tell me what you need. So she had a moment. She went to WWDC.
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.680]   There you are, Kelly. Working with the girls. So cool.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:58.480]   So she had a moment at WWDC where she realized she was in a room that sat 5,000 people and she
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:02.960]   could not see another woman from where she was sitting. And because what we do in Portland is go,
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:08.640]   well, I see a need. I'm going to go build that. Let's fix it. Yeah. She went and built it.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:14.160]   So she didn't go just sit down and write some sort of hand-wringing piece about how come there's no
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.680]   girls. And she didn't just sort of complain. She actually like did something. So Appcam for
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:27.440]   Girls goes on for a week per session. So we do two sessions here in Portland. We do usually one in
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:32.880]   June and one in August. It's also in Vancouver and Seattle this year. Yeah. This year we have
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.920]   Vancouver and Seattle. There are still spots open in Seattle. So if you have a girl who is entering
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:44.480]   eighth or ninth grade this fall, then you're more than welcome to sign up and join us. If you
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:48.800]   want to volunteer, there are a lot of volunteer opportunities. You don't have to be female to help
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:55.600]   us out. And the thing about it is that we spend a week and we show them how to build a basic app
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.480]   in Xcode. They get an iPod touch for the week. And the first day we build a calculator, a basic
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.440]   calculator app and send them home with it. So they come into camp. First thing Monday morning,
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:10.160]   we start sort of learning everybody's names. And by Monday night, they have built an app and
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:14.960]   taken it home on the iPod touch to show the families. Now in most cases, are these kids
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:22.240]   like they must be like kind of geeky already, right? Or no. So sometimes yes and sometimes no.
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:26.720]   Sometimes we get we get people who would not have had any interest in iOS programming. Like
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:31.040]   every so often, there's somebody who says, you know, I'm just here because my mom said I had to
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.840]   do a camp this summer. And then at the end of the week, they are super pumped.
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:41.200]   I'm gonna cry. This is so cool. So they start with a template and the template is a quiz. And so
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:46.880]   you have to they have to decide what kind of quiz it's going to be. And it's a multiple choice
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:51.520]   thing. So they have five questions. Each question has five has four possible answers. And they have
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.080]   to determine what kind of quiz it is, what the what all the questions will be, what all the answers
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:02.000]   will be, and then what those answers result in. So if you take what mythical creature are you,
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.120]   then each one of those answers has to go well, one of the results is Bigfoot and one of the results
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.480]   is a unicorn and one of those results is a fairy princess and one of those results is, you know,
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:18.480]   another thing. And so they have to be able to route all of that, you know, to whatever the end
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:24.560]   result is going to ultimately be. And so by the end of the week, they then have to present their
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:30.720]   finished app. It's it's finished on Thursday. And then they put together a presentation and they give
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:38.400]   a presentation to a wall of a panel of female investors. And they get up and they have a keynote
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:42.240]   presentation. They walk through slides. They talk about their app, how their app is going to make
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:47.040]   money, whether it's because they price the app at a certain rate or the app is free and they're
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:52.080]   going to have in-app purchases or every once in a while, there's a team that says, what we're going
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.240]   to do is sell you an action figure or a t-shirt with your result on it. So if you if you got Bigfoot,
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:04.960]   you can buy like a Bigfoot dolly, you know, and this was what I got in my quiz. So there's there's
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.800]   all different kinds of things like that that that they that they come up with for ways that their
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:15.760]   app will make money. And so with everybody's quiz, the icon, the artwork, all of that came from
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:21.520]   whatever team that was because they work in a group of four for the week. So we have 15 quizzes
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:29.840]   in it. It's 99 cents. And all of the proceeds from the app itself go right back into funding appcamp.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:39.520]   That is so great. I love this. Go and get it. It's for iOS app camp, quiz compendium by app camp
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.800]   for girls. We have a couple of cavemen in the chat room. So what about boys? Believe me, there
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.920]   are plenty of opportunities for boys. It's nice to have an opportunity for girls where they're not
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.880]   pushed aside by the boys. And I think this is the greatest thing ever. And that's what we hear from
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.600]   almost everybody that that shows up is like, well, I went to another technology camp, you know,
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:06.880]   some sort of computer camp or something. And all the boys shouted over me. And so, you know, so
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:12.480]   not being one, not being insane, you know, trying the same thing and expecting a different result,
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.480]   I just shut up and I sat back and I let them do everything. And that's not a fun experience.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:20.400]   And so I'm excited to be here where I get to contribute because everyone is so great.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.360]   Because no one here is trying to jockey each other for position. They're just hanging out. And
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:32.880]   it's a lot of fun. It's a complete blast. It's so much fun to get to do this. And to have that
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:39.520]   moment where somebody who maybe wasn't considering software as a career path looks at it and suddenly
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.920]   realizes that somebody has to draw all of the all of the images that you see in the app that you
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.200]   use on your phone every day. Somebody had to come up with somebody. Yeah. Somebody had to come up
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.240]   with an icon. When we give them the template for the quiz, there's a bug in it and it won't
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.080]   build initially. And so then they get to learn about bug testing. And there's usually somebody
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.880]   who goes, this is great. I love getting to break stuff. And, you know, and someone else, like,
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.200]   there is someone who's always super pumped about Xcode. Like, this is so awesome. I love that when
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.520]   I type this thing, it changes this thing over here. And then when I build it on my touch, it's really
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.880]   great. And, you know, there's a step along the way where everyone gets an opportunity. And
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:23.120]   there's a moment for each of them, whatever the team is, every time I've been there,
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.040]   on every team, there's a moment when somebody goes, I just realized somebody has to draw all
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.600]   this stuff. And I don't have to, you know, I don't have to be just a person, a coder, you know,
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.240]   when people think about typing mysteries into a laptop, that's not that's there's so much more
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.640]   to it than that. And so it's really exciting to give them that opportunity and expose them to it.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.400]   And we don't expect that all of these girls are going to go on to be computer scientists.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.880]   That's totally not it. But maybe we've exposed them to something that they think about a little
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.280]   differently now and demystifying some of that may may cause some of them to. We've seen some of
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:00.080]   the girls go on in high school to be part of computer clubs and things. And I really think
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:06.160]   there's there's a huge place for it. There are probably some people who will go on from app camp
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:12.880]   to something else and do something technologically like long term. But there's also just the opportunity
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.240]   to sort of expose them to the other pieces of it because there's so much more to software
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:21.520]   development than just the person who hunches over laptop and types mystery stuff into a
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.880]   black window with white text. Like there's there's a lot more than that. So I think it's
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:32.240]   awesome. So I'm really excited to get to be part of it. And I'm excited to tell anybody who will
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.920]   listen that the app is out and you should get it because it's a buck and it's awesome. And it's
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.160]   fun to take the quizzes like one of the quizzes became what Penguin are you because one of the
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.920]   girls that was on that team really enjoyed drawing penguins. And so she drew a little penguin wearing
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.240]   sneakers and just doodling while they were trying to come up with a quiz idea and that became the
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:55.280]   quiz. App camp for girls is a nonprofit. You can't donate to them of course directly. But by buying
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.840]   this 99 cent app you're supporting them. And I think that's and you're having some fun. And
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.560]   I think it probably feels good for the kids that oh look people are buying our app.
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:11.120]   Our app is in the app store. That's really neat. If you want a more diverse workplace if you want
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.560]   if you want some opportunity in your workplace you got to support this kind of stuff. There are
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:22.240]   plenty of places boys can get this experience plenty but there are very few places. In fact
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.800]   there's the only one I know of where girls can do it without boys shouting over a mine like this.
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:33.520]   App camp for girls. And I love it to your counselor. Yeah it's so great. It's like I said it's so
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.960]   much fun. I'm excited every year when it comes around again like just about now like the weather's
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:43.840]   getting warmer and you know as the sun comes out more it's like it's getting to be time.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:50.720]   I'm it's gonna go back and get to do more stuff. And it's a lot of fun. And for me it's also a little
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:57.600]   bit selfish because I've been a techno person. I've always really like computers all the way back to
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.440]   when my third grade teacher decided computers were going to be important about an Apple II E.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:10.640]   So and I sat down in front of that and basically haven't gotten up since. So I got really tired of
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:17.360]   being the only girl and this is a way that I can help make that go away. So for me it's it's
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.400]   also a little bit personal like I'm really tired of it. And so it's really nice to have the opportunity
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:29.760]   to do something directly myself that might help fix that. So nice job. Thank you. And thank you
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:37.120]   for being here Kelly. Come on. Good one. Come on. Come on. Renee Richie your app cap.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:41.360]   I'm first I'm going to echo what Kelly said because it's it's an awesome awesome thing that
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:46.080]   they're doing and it's if there's any way that anyone can support it please do. And if you have
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.440]   trouble understanding why it's important because a lot of people say oh it's you know it's not that
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:53.760]   important. Whatever you have in your life whether it's a culture or something think about a time when
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:57.360]   you didn't like the way it was portrayed in a movie or a TV show or something or you weren't
[01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:01.040]   allowed to do something because of just just because of who you are and then try to develop some
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:05.920]   empathy based on that because this this is beneficial for the future of technology for everybody getting
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:11.440]   more more diversity and opinions in in in thoughts and ideas and community. It's just it's so
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:17.760]   meritorious and Jean and Kelly and everybody just deserve tons and tons of love. Amazing. Amazing
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:24.000]   cause. My picks are way more self-serving than this. There's a couple updates that I really like
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.480]   recently that added watch functionality and I found them especially useful on the watch. I did a whole
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:32.320]   piece the other day about traveling on an airplane with the watch and you're paying for Starbucks and
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.680]   getting Uber and having my flight pat my boarding pass on it. This weekend I went to the Avengers my
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.240]   ticket was on my Apple watch and I went to dinner first with a reservation reminder on my Apple
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:48.320]   watch. Today I was waiting for this Apple watch to come in for my sister and I knew it was coming
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.760]   because the update for the Apple Store app is on the watch and it notifies you when the thing is
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:58.000]   actually on the truck and in route and I also use the deliveries app which is a phenomenal app.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.440]   It's been on the iPhone for a long time. It's available on the Mac now and you I just threw a
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:07.760]   gob of text because I had hard time cutting and pasting the tracking code out of one of the emails
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.440]   into it and it just identified the code and said this looks like a UPS code. Do you want to add it?
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:15.840]   And I said yes yes I do deliveries. Thank you so much. And it put it into their system and it's
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.960]   on my iPhone. It's on my Apple watch and yes I can always go to my iPhone but one of the things
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:26.000]   about the Apple Store app is for some reason I don't know why they have not yet implemented
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.160]   touch ID on it. So I have to enter my pass code every time I want to look at my orders like an
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:35.040]   animal and it's just it's it's I know it's not a really big problem but it's inconvenient enough
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.920]   that it makes me not check it as much as I want. But with the Apple watch as long as I'm pinned
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:44.080]   into my Apple watch and I'm in skin contact it'll just show me my last couple orders. I can look at
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:49.120]   it anytime get a quick update. You can set up all the glances for these things so it really is as
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.040]   simple as turning your wrist tapping a few times and I knew I had a rough idea when it was on the
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:57.040]   truck when it was going to be here and it's it's one of those things that just sort of give me a
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:01.920]   light into the into the sort of convenience that we're going to get maybe not immediately maybe not
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.400]   for every app but for the developers who've had time to work on it and really got a sense of how to
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:13.840]   how to best use this this type of experience. It has me incredibly hopeful because they both of
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.320]   them just nail it. I can get information on my wrist in a couple seconds. I get the notification
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.120]   as soon as just in time it's it's never wasting my time before it's ready. It's never too late.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:27.360]   It's it arrives there sort of like Gandalf. I you know I get it when I when I need it and
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:34.400]   I can't get over what it's like sort of living in in this age of um it's a really different
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:37.680]   experience because the notifications tell you information when you need to know it and the
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:43.760]   glances let you look for information when you want they're persistent. They're not like ephemeral
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:48.240]   like the notifications and having both just means that I get what I want when I need it but also
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:53.280]   if I'm just curious or stressed or perseverating over something I can quickly you know look at it
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.240]   know that it's done and relax about it and just go along about my day. So love these apps. I'm
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.520]   gonna get them because I'm always wondering where's my delivery is fantastic. I'm sure yours will
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.720]   be like filled with 90 items and I'm gonna know it's so I use a program called slice it's similar
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:13.360]   it goes through my Gmail and yeah does all that but I'm gonna try deliveries that looks good.
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:20.720]   Yeah great. Delivery is glorious. That's the one huh? It's my favorite because it was the first
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:26.000]   to nail push notification for deliveries so it would just pop up on my phone and say it's on a
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.080]   truck or whatever. Yeah and I really and I really enjoy that that and if I look at the email and
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.440]   copy the email all I have to copy the tracking number out of the email I can open deliveries and
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:41.120]   deliveries will say it looks like you have a tracking number on your clipboard and I'm like
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:46.480]   this is me living in the future. Why yes as a matter of fact I do and it's that one moment that I
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.320]   really that that is every time I do that it's pleasing. Actually you know apple you can and then
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:55.680]   when we buy some of the apple store you can set it to send you a text messages and they're very
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:01.520]   cheerful. You know good news your your delivery is in the way but they don't tell you what it is.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.640]   So a couple of times we've been bit now Lisa got bit she ordered the new MacBook
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.640]   but she also ordered as on my recommendation a dongle a type C dongle and she got the text
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:18.320]   message good news your order is on its way and she she didn't learn as I have learned by bitter
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:24.640]   experience. Always the dongle. It's always the dongle so the package arrives it's the dongle.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:29.840]   Yeah and she's or the charger or whatever else like the case whatever you don't. So click the link
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.440]   and and follow go to the order to see what you're getting because it isn't there's someone at UPS
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:38.560]   just laughing. They're getting the dongle. They're getting the dongle today.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.280]   Ah ha ha. Totally. Take that geeks. Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:52.320]   I have two picks one a non tech peak but pick that I kind of like a lot. This is a graphic novel
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:59.440]   volume two the collected band debt by calling Cooper and Cooper and Paul Tobin. It is one of my
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:04.480]   people often ask me hey I don't read comics but I know that you are what kind of what we recommend
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:11.680]   and this is just such a delightful book. The title character is a cat burglar in Paris
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:17.040]   that's sort of modeled after Audrey Hepburn in a really really good like movie from
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:24.480]   sit up sit down. Really good movie from a on turn classic movies that you really really want to see
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:31.280]   it's lighthearted there's action there's adventure there's humor it's just such a pleasure just page
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:36.320]   after page after page. It's all ages friendly but it's not like written down to kids it is just
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:44.160]   literally a really great like rated PG adventure and this is volume two that just came out like
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:50.560]   about a couple of weeks ago. I am very very pleased and proud that Paul and Colleen asked me to
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:58.080]   write the forward right a forward to it. So you will see about 800 birds from me that is by no means
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:03.440]   has any place next to Paul's words and Colleen's art but despite that really really very very
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:07.600]   strong recommend volume one and volume two they're both excellent. But the other thing is tech
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:15.760]   related and it is I have just discovered city mapper which is the answer to like all of my
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:22.880]   transit prayers. It is if you haven't used it before it has like transit for about 90 countries
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:27.440]   90 cities around the world they pretty much seem to have everything that has a really deep transit
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:33.360]   system. And so I've basically activated like the Boston zone of this and it works great because you
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:38.720]   spend maybe 10 or 15 or 20 minutes telling it about like how you use transit mostly saying here are
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:45.760]   the stations that I often use and travel to. Here's the here's where my work destination is is usually
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.840]   here's where my home is. And then once you've gotten that set up when you're leaving the house
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:54.000]   you just simply tap a button and it shows you here's your next train to work and here's the next
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.320]   train after that. Or you're in the middle of a city even if it's a foreign city and it will tell you
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:03.200]   here are different transportation hubs nearby. So if you're near if you're near South Station
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.960]   we'll say here's South Station here's where it is on the map here are the next three or four trains
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:11.840]   departing from South Station. Or and you see the sort of deck of other buttons up at the top here
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:16.000]   if you find out that oh damn the next train the next train to where I need to go is actually three
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.560]   and a half hours away. Okay what if what about what about the subway or even is there a bike rental
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.560]   bike share someplace nearby is there water taxi and if not you can actually even
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:31.280]   have a button and call an Uber call a taxi from where you are. It really is the ultimate
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:36.240]   solution where you don't launch one of these apps because you have an academic interest in
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.680]   public transport because I am here right now I need to be there as soon as possible. What are my
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:46.320]   options? You're a phone you have GPS you know where I am you can access schedules just tell me
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:53.840]   what's available to me. We're from where I am right now. It's it's it's the MBTA has their own app
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:58.480]   the Mass Bay Transit Authority has their own app and it's like so terrible that every time you launch
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:04.960]   it I'm always looking for the next train from the station this near my house to downtown it's always
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:10.800]   the same thing but every time I launch it it asks me well what line do you want to choose? Okay do you
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:15.840]   want inbound or outbound? Do you want a weekday schedule or weekend schedule and every time as
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:21.360]   I'm tapping through this I'm thinking you know where I am you know it's Saturday and you know that I
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:26.480]   am now 20 miles away from Boston so I maybe want to get the inbound train just just guess.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:32.160]   So this is the one that basically takes all of those guesses for you and it just simply says yeah so
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:36.640]   I mean it's just and also they have if they have an android version of it so you're not locked in
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.720]   and you can use a common sign in to get like all of your preferences if you're if you're split
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:47.600]   between multiple devices they have an Apple Watch app that is so good that Apple actually uses it
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:54.240]   as an example in the design guidelines book for how to design for Apple Watch so it's a really
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:58.800]   muscular app and it's like it's one of those like real forehead slap sort of things where I'm
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.920]   I find out about it and I download it and I love it then I say I hope this was just released two
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:07.840]   weeks ago because if this has been around for a year and I'm only now just finding out about it
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:13.440]   that doesn't speak well of me but in any event you're at least happy even if I wasn't like on the
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.520]   ground floor of this at least you know I now have it now because again it's like Kelly said sometimes
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.640]   you just you're surprised at how satisfied you are that an app works in exactly the most rational
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:29.840]   and useful way it can possibly act like hey I'm a I'm an app that deals with tracking numbers I
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:32.960]   see on the clipboard there seems to be something that looks like a tracking number would you like
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:38.160]   me to do something useful with it for you because it's not that it's not that hard to paste it in
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.800]   yourself but you like the app that your program to be useful to me you could be more useful right
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:48.560]   now so great stuff and it's like now it's on all my devices yay yeah I like it when the programs
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:55.360]   are intelligent yeah now Andy is that for everywhere or is that only for certain cities
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.960]   this it's for certain only for certain cities but it's for a lot of certain cities I think there are
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.680]   like 90 cities that are that are everywhere and it's not as though you have to download a
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.600]   special New York City version of the app you actually you launch you launch it for the first
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:15.040]   time you actually see like a carousel of cities with little cute little robot icons of you know the
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:21.440]   the Boston one is a person with a red sock on their on their foot the Paris one maybe you get
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.320]   beret in a straight shirt I don't know I use it in the London sensitive I don't know but
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.080]   but but it's great because not only is it going to be incredibly and deeply useful to you in your
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:33.920]   day-to-day life but then you find yourself in New York and you don't know when the next
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.160]   what I need to get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art should I take the tax should I grab a taxi
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.760]   or should I take the subway or should I do whatever it will say there are all the options from where
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:45.120]   you are to where you tell me you want to go and it's so much better and so much more
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:51.520]   helpful than even Google Maps well and like there's an awesome trimate app for getting around here
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:56.480]   in Portland that is useless the rest of the time yeah so that's why I was wondering if this is
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:03.280]   if this is like that or not it's complicated because for a while there was a standard and cities because
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.120]   they are owned by the people were giving away these maps and then they suddenly for some reason
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.920]   decided no you know what we ought to have our own app and we can make money and they shut it down
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:19.200]   so it's really up to its they can these maps in Google does the transit directions too
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:25.040]   they only work in places where the city isn't like saying we copyright these maps and you're not
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.440]   and these transit information and you're not allowed to have it yeah well Boston is
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.520]   really good and that not not only do they let them have the maps but they also give them
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:39.600]   right access to not only schedule but like delays and buses are right now and all that yeah yeah and
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.400]   it's it's it's you can't do you can't really do much better than that I only wish that were possible
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:52.000]   for me to buy electronic tickets to the SAP so I wouldn't use the MBTA app ever but yeah I mean
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.280]   it's it's it's it must be so very gratifying to be a developer when you know that or you get a
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.000]   feedback from someone that says that I hated the process of trying to find out when the next train
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.440]   was and now I don't hate it anymore because I know that I have a friend and ally in the work in the
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.320]   the app that you had a hand in creating thank you very much
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:18.400]   we are almost out of time I'm just going to mention very quickly that I I shed a little tier when
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:24.240]   four squares separated into two apps four square became Yelp and they created a check-in app called
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:30.560]   swarm that had none of the fun of four square but four square 3.0 is coming Mayoral's Mayors will
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:37.760]   be back and they have released a new swarm app today I think that has a lot of fun functionality
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.160]   I think they realized that they pretty much killed the audience for four square when they took all
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.040]   that was that's when I quit using it yep me too and if you have a watch and it's all
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:53.040]   complicated and it's no fun so they got stickers now and they have an apple watch interface so
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:59.280]   you can go to the apple watch interface and check in directly from it so I'll check in right now at
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:04.080]   the brick house and it gives you information about who's nearby they have some nice features too they
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.240]   have added to swarm you can message everybody in your neighborhood and say hey let's get a drink
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:15.760]   anybody around come on I really think that the that the four square listened and realized or maybe
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:20.560]   they just noticed nobody was using it anymore just as annoying it keeps wanting you to download
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:27.200]   page manager or messenger or tell your friends to do this leave me alone uh so the new swarm is
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.480]   out if you use a watch you might want to use it for check in and yes once again I shall be mayor
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:39.280]   of my hot tub hallelujah thank you so much thank you so much Lisa I stole that for my book read

[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:31.040]   like two weeks ago at the Yosemite conference so now because the pin is not so weak they've kept
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:35.680]   falling off yeah do I keep it on their risk losing it or do I keep it on because I like having my

[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.920]   another she she gets sources I'll buy a tooth or two because on top of everything else that's a
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.200]   great logo yeah I love the logo and here's the story of the logo because this is a really cool
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:00.080]   thing and I'll be really fast um uh Gene McDonald attended the world domination summit here in town
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:06.960]   and at the world domination summit um I think it was two years ago um they ended up in the
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:10.400]   budget they had extra money and so they gave everybody a hundred dollars and had them listen
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.400]   to the person who wrote the book the hundred dollar startup so Gene took her hundred dollars and
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.760]   and knew a graphic designer and said and went to the graphic designer and said um this is my idea
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.000]   I'm trying to build something for app camp and I would like the logo and could you could could
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.720]   I pay you a hundred dollars for the logo I know it's not enough but would you be willing to do it for
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:35.680]   for the opportunity to help app camp become a reality by having this logo and so the owl that's on
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:40.800]   everything that's that's app camp uh was started with that hundred dollars from the hundred dollar
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.960]   startup uh at world domination summit so I always think that's a great story it would make an
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:53.520]   excellent four-square sticker dens yes dens it would make an excellent four-square sticker I'm just

[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:56.800]   the weirdest thing from photos please photos not before my coffee this library contains items that
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:00.080]   need to download from my cloud photo library to download the complete library delete the incomplete
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:03.840]   items and set this library as a system photo library and preferences and enable i cloud photo
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.760]   library this will disable i cloud photo library on any other libraries and then there's two buttons
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:13.840]   both of which are terrifying delete incomplete items are quit yeah so i said you can only have
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:17.760]   one i cloud photo library which is called the system library and if you had i had never used it i
