[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy, Renee, and Lori.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   They're all in the house.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   We're going to talk about jailbreaking.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.600]   A jailbreak that works on all iPhones.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.720]   Why Renee says the next iPhone will not have a USB-C port,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.480]   but what it will have next year is pretty exciting.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   And the Mythic Quest Apple TV Plus
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.920]   shot entirely on iPhone.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.240]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   Macintosh news from Apple.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   Actually, I shouldn't say Mac news,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.760]   because it's just as often iOS and services
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760]   as Mac News.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   Alex Lindsey has the week off.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.400]   Renee Richie's here from Renee Richie.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.680]   The audience is my me.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.400]   Hey, you know, Joe Rogan just sold his YouTube channel
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200]   to Spotify for $100 million.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.600]   You could probably do the same.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   I'm just saying.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.360]   I'm just saying.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200]   No, I still want audience to go.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.280]   I still want audience.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.120]   I'd actually like to know-- it was snowing here last week,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.920]   and now it's 90 degrees.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.120]   I just-- I don't know anymore.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   It's the noon number one.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   It's sprung.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   It's the new normal.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   That's just the way life is.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   Two seasons.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120]   Winter and summer.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   That's all you get.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   That is pretty sudden.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.400]   That's a pretty sudden jump.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.760]   Laurie Gill is also in the very hot Sacramento area.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.640]   She is a managing editor for iMore.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Hello, Laurie.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.800]   How's it going?
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   I heard you talking earlier today about your love of the iPhone
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   SE.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.720]   So I'm on the same page as you.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   I've been using the SE for a month now, I guess.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600]   And I definitely love it.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.800]   It's made for people wearing masks.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.040]   Oh, we thought Touch ID was so old fashioned.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.680]   No, no, no, that's a pretty good idea.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.640]   It don't wear gloves.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.320]   Well, yeah, see, you can't-- yeah, there's always something.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   That's why you should have both, honestly.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   You should have three.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.000]   You should have voice, and you should have gate analysis,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.720]   and then it should just do the work for you.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   I know it's you.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   No, you must have to decide.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   I know it's you, Renee.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   I know.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.960]   Andy and Akko's also here.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.880]   I don't know what his gates like, but we know it's him from the sideburns.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O.com.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   Hello, F.G.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   Hello, F.G.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.400]   I bet you Apple people would love to have something like the Pixel 4 phone from Google,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.640]   whose magical, solely radar chip allows you to interact with the interface without touching
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.960]   the screen at all, rendering gloves absolutely inconsequential.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.640]   And I bet owners of the Pixel 4 wish that that feature did anything more than let you
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.960]   skip tracks and pause audio.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   Nothing.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.760]   Nothing's happening.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.200]   Actually, I heard a rumor they're dumping it, which is even funnier.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Yeah, that's-
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   That would be-
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.280]   I'm so angry and sort of pressed with the Pixel right now.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.360]   I think that when Google wished upon the monkey's pawns said we want to be like Samsung,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.080]   they should have been more specific.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   In terms of-
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.120]   For the last I heard, as opposed to having half-baked features that don't really do anything.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.680]   The last I heard, the CFO really, really wants an iPhone to have a tertiary revenue stream.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640]   The development team wants a phone that's easy for everyone to buy so that they can test
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   their stuff against it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.320]   And the product team wants to have a place where they can dog food all of the stuff that
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.720]   Google's working on.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.520]   And none of these groups talk to each other.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   And so Rick Octor was like, "What phone did you make me?"
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   And they're like, "We don't know.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   You in charge?"
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   [laughter]
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   I just ditched.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   Make a plan.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.760]   Yes, that's something that this is why Apple and Google are really good companies to have
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.560]   like facing off each other because we have one company to judge another one against.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.160]   Like, can you imagine an Apple like the head of the hardware division calling everybody
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.400]   in the iPhone division together saying, "I've just been in- I'm very disappointed with
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.360]   the battery life of the new phone that we're going to be walking in two months."
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   And like, "Well, sir, does that mean that you didn't know about it until this morning
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.600]   or that you just let it go like that?"
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.560]   Because you really wanted to have this big macho, "Ooh, I'm really disappointed in your
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   dad's moment."
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   Like, "No, fix it."
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   As a person who wanted to buy this phone, fix the problem.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   And jailbreak it now.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   How about that?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   [laughter]
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   Definitely.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.560]   Every iPhone, right?
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   Every jailbreak.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   Their phones.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   As much anymore?
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.600]   The truth is, I saw this story and I didn't...
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.160]   This is the only place I brought it up because it's like, "Who cares?"
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   People, some people iPad a file, like they want to take the Instagram app or they want
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.040]   to take the iPad only stuff like Playgrounds and run it on their iPads or take like the
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.080]   iPhone only stuff like Instagram and run it on their iPads.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   And so like that, like there's like very niche nerdy little things that you can still
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.440]   do, but I'm not convinced any of them are worth the effort anymore.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.240]   I think the hacker community in general gets the joy of jailbreaking, but outside of
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.600]   that, just the average everyday people, that's where I think it's kind of just a fun thing
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.800]   to do now instead of it being almost a necessity like it used to be for some people.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   Like dark mode is done.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   We got dark mode.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   We're fine.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   [laughter]
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.280]   It's downloadable if you want from a GitHub, from Pwn to Own stuff.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.600]   You can, it's the uncover 5.0.0.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.280]   It will let you jailbreak any iPhone running iOS 11 all the way up to the most recent version
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.120]   of iOS 13.5.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   Who cares?
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120]   I don't care.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   Don't know.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120]   It's a dumb thing to do.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   I understand, but don't do it.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120]   Why would you do it?
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   I understand.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.560]   You gave some reasons, but if you want to do that kind of stuff, buy a Pixel, buy something
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   else, don't buy an iPhone.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   Yeah, but still it is significant for the rest of us because Apple doesn't act, doesn't
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.320]   have an unlocked bootloader.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   It doesn't say please.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.480]   We invite you to customize.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.520]   It means that they, it means that people who wanted a new exciting version of a new flashlight
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.160]   and FART app found weaknesses in the security of the phone, which means that other people
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.440]   probably found those same weaknesses in the security of the phone as well.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   I just feel like you shouldn't buy an iPhone to customize it.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   It's like that's...
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   Expecting to customize it.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   Expecting to customize it.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160]   I mean, you're right.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   It's your phone.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.400]   You should be able to do whatever the hell you want with it, and I'm glad you can.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   But really people buy iPhones.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.240]   In my mind, you should buy an iPhone because you like the way Apple says to do things,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.040]   and you should just do it that way.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   And if you...
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.360]   When I have this theory that people go to the store and if they don't know anything about
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.560]   phones, they don't care anything about phones, they just want to be able to use Facebook,
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.840]   they get whatever phone is zero dollars on their carrier, and it's usually an Android
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.160]   phone that's heavily subsidized, or the sales rep has a promotion for getting rid of it.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   They're fine.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.520]   Other people are nervous and they've heard Apple phones are easier to use, so they come
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.160]   in asking for an iPhone.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.000]   Then at a certain point, they get bored.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.400]   They're like, "Ah, there's a grid of icons."
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   "There it is."
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   "I just want to make my phone my phone."
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.640]   So they get an Android phone, often a Samsung phone.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   They change the font to comic songs.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.200]   They do whatever they want with it, and they're fine.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   But then at a certain point, they're like, "Ah, it's taking so much time to customize,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.600]   and I've got a reset, and it's not working, and it's getting old."
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.200]   "Look, I'm tired of working from my phone.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.000]   I just want a phone that I can't do anything with, so all I can do is make that phone."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   "You've just…"
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.200]   "We've invented the circle of iPhone is what you've got."
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.840]   "Yes, okay, that's…"
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.800]   "I went through this, Lee."
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.080]   "I was going to cite a different Broadway theme.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.600]   You're basically taking the George III approach.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   You'll be back soon.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   You'll see.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.240]   You'll be able to buy a brand new iPhone."
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.440]   "It's like sometimes you buy your furniture, sometimes you make your furniture.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.320]   It depends on your mood, and we're lucky we have the choice to go with what we want
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   at the moment."
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   "The problem is that people want a choice with the iPhone, which is fine, I guess,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.400]   and yeah, you can jailbreak it.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   It's just…
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   "It makes everything so janky.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   Yeah, it's such a…"
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.080]   "All the screenshots on the Twitter are suddenly comic songs, and just think of the rest of
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   it."
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.040]   "Maybe the new super low-cost 2020 iPhone SE is going to make it easier or make it something
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.680]   that jailbreakers want because they can have their really expensive $1000 iPhone that
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.760]   they don't jailbreak plus their $400 iPhone SE that they can just play around with.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   I would consider it just for fun if I had that desire, for sure."
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.440]   "When I was going up to Canada to call for help with Amber MacArthur, and the first iPhone
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.640]   came out in 2007, I bought one for you, you couldn't run it because it was only on AT&T,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   you couldn't run it.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.440]   Anything jailbroke it and gave it to her, she never used it, probably because it was janky,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   right?
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.240]   And remember the jailbreak was a tip, like you opened a tip for something in the browser
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   in the whole book, was jailbroke.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.040]   It was a mess.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.560]   It's a really cool part.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.720]   Jailbreaking is a really cool part of the history of the iPhone because we forget how
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:48.840]   much of our pleasure of using an iPhone was based on agreeing to wait on basic features
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.560]   that have been out for years.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.480]   Like apps, tethering, exactly, apps, just basic things that were like, "I really, the
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.800]   only thing I wish I had in my Blackberry was the ability to tether, the ability to do that."
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.240]   On that basis, yes, heroic means are necessary so that you can continue to not have to use
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   a Blackberry or not.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.360]   You have to use a trio or something like that.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   But yeah, I like Renee's idea that for everybody, that if you've been using an iPhone for five
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.520]   or 10 years, and you feel that you're legitimately intrigued by Android or vice versa, like I've
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.960]   now been on Android since 2013, 2014, and now I'm legitimately intrigued about, my daily
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   driver phone is a Pixel One.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.000]   It is now at end of life, it's not going to get any more security updates, so this is
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.680]   the year that I really kind of need to replace it.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.720]   And there's a really good chance I'll buy an iPhone, not necessarily because anything
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.560]   has disgusted me about Google or its Pixel phones, but that I've been with this for seven
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   years now.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.400]   The two platforms are really, really similar at this point, and it might be, it would be
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.640]   kind of fun to be back on the iPhone platform for the next two or three years of using a
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   phone.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.520]   I think that if you don't, I think that if you're not excited enough to try to walk on the other
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.000]   side of the street for a while, you kind of lost your lust for technology.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.520]   I should mention that a jailbreak on an iPhone is not the same thing as rooting on Android.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   A jailbreak.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.400]   Only thing a jailbreak does in the iPhone is let you use third party stores.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.200]   That's all breaks in a root jail.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.840]   But on an Android phone, there's a setting for that.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.600]   So an Android phone in order to get it to maybe run a third party, soft or wrong, so
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   that you have a completely different phone or you get updates or whatever you want to,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.120]   you can, in some not all, you can root them, which means you can completely replace the
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   firmware.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.400]   You get on the elevator, you flash it, you come out with a completely different rom.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.960]   So it's a very, that's a very different thing from jailbreaking.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.440]   Jailbreaking is kind of a trivial, simple thing.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.960]   And the only reason I don't recommend it is because those third party stores, God only
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   knows what's in there.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.520]   I'll see the other reason.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.280]   I mean, one of the reasons why a lot of, there's a lot of, hey, I own this phone, I
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   should be able to do what I want with this phone.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.200]   A lot of that comes down to I should be able to be able to download apps that commercial
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.520]   apps I don't have to pay for from like really, really weird, like Siberian repositories that
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   have.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.000]   If I could jailbreak an iPhone and put a headphone jack on it, that'd be a different.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That's a hardware.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.240]   Well, the guy in the drill for that.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   Remember, he's got a drill.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   Yeah, I got a drill.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   It's all the way on.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   Okay.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   That was epic.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   Probably janky.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   He's wire level.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   That's that channel alone.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.560]   Every time there's an argument about how about right to repair saying, well, the thing
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.760]   is like there's nothing that there's there's there's nothing that a user can do that Apple
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.960]   store can't do better.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.040]   It's like, yeah, but you realize that you've got this guy that lives that used to live like
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.360]   actually in like cell phone city.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.000]   And said, gee, I wish I wonder if there's a way I could put a headphone jack on an iPhone.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.080]   You just keeps going back and forth to like the stores to the to like the the hacker walls.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.800]   And now he's got a headphone jack on the same life.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   I want to like keep going.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   That's a great channel.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   Keep going.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.600]   I'll match you one for one.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.680]   If there's a Kickstarter where I can buy a fully breadboarded phone, just nothing but
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.400]   like wire wire connectors.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.800]   I think that's a fun.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.320]   I mean, does it purism and others don't they make phones that are pretty like you could
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.800]   just get in there and do anything you want with it.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.680]   There's there's for the Raspberry Pi platform, you can buy a 3G module for it.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.560]   And there are plans to here's a here's how to build a phone completely from scratch.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.760]   And I love that idea.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.440]   However, by the time it's finished, it's about the size of a carton of milk.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.360]   And I'm not sure that I'm ready to be that flashy about my nerd.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.600]   I just feel like the iPhone is kind of a perfect elegant thing.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.520]   And it's just kind of it's a mainstream phone.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.280]   It really is a mainstream smartphone.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.960]   Well, increasingly and I and I like Android and you see I have a pixel for but increasingly
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.880]   I'm just thinking I just guess maybe I'm at that end of the cycle that you went through
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.120]   Renee where I just feel like it's more secure.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.920]   The iPhone is more secure.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.880]   The iPhone that yes, I wish it had some other it was.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.320]   I was finally like I had the palms and the windows, mobiles and I was forever tweaking
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.920]   them and customizing them and going, why does one on this carrier have Wi-Fi and well,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   this carrier has 3G and it was it was it was a Wild West phones.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   And now.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.640]   Well, you know what?
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.120]   I think that Apple could in terms of all the things I really like customizing my Android
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:48.560]   phone about Apple could totally totally obliterate that whole advantage in my mind by simply
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.880]   giving us a much better launcher.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   I love how.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   Totally.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Not just that, but how about the ability to create my own widgets and shortcuts and put
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.400]   them anywhere I want to amongst those icons.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.200]   Or a third party allow third party launches as Android does.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.760]   Because that's that's the most wonderful thing attacks.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   Yeah, okay.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   That's what they worried about.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.640]   They're worried about like so there were.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.240]   I think what Andy's talking about is something that they'll move to where you can basically
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.040]   create any shortcut or create any widget or put anything in any arbitrary place.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.520]   I think they're worried about seating for two reasons seating seating new launchers because
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.600]   they would be a Google and a Facebook launcher like that.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.760]   You know, that's that's one of their their worries.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.360]   But also that they want to be able to get that.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   Why?
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Well, no, absolutely.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.400]   But also that there are a lot there would be launchers that that just do it in a way.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.720]   Like the first thing the Facebook launcher would do is measure every lap that you every
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.280]   app that you launch ever so they could figure out which ones to buy.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.080]   And then they're all the way back at their at their VPN circle again.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   Right.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.680]   There's a guy in the chat room is very sophisticated.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.480]   He says if you have X code and you have the source code, you can install arbitrary apps
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   using X code.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.360]   Legally and legitimately.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.240]   And that might be for somebody who's sufficiently technically skilled a safer and preferable
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   way to do it.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240]   There's a mean to be.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   Let me ask.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   I don't know.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.040]   Maybe gardener could respond or you know guys.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:19.800]   But do you have to use test flight or how would you how do you install apps from X code directly
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   on there?
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.440]   Test flight is for other people for test flight.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.000]   You can just you can just tell yourself and push them over.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I mean you'd have to self sign them.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   But that's not a big deal.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.640]   And the phone wouldn't wouldn't bar if you just say okay.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   Oh, there's stuff now.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.680]   There's a bunch of utilities that you can you just download off GitHub and you sell you
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.000]   I'll tell them in X code self sign them.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.160]   There's some over that.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   But see, that's a perfect example.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   Why could do that?
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   I have X code.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160]   I know how to do that.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   I code.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   But I don't want to.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   It's like I'm fine.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   And it's a good area.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   You're an entry person.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   You shouldn't be doing it.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.200]   But also yeah, on the on the other hand, it's nice to bootstrap people into taking more
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.920]   control and learning more things when the when the first thing you do is something that
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   is so you're just following instruct and instructables that you found someplace.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.720]   And then you realize, well, how do I that's nice.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.360]   Wonder how I can do this.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.240]   And then you sort of get a little bit into the deeper ends of the pool and the deeper
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   ends of the pool.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.560]   That's but as I'm talking about this though, I do have to acknowledge that this is the
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.040]   difference between stuff that I think is important because I sometimes I have like a
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:27.120]   fatherly approach thinking that, well, son, like I could help you to fix that fix that
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   bike.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.600]   But I think that I think it's time for you to learn how to how to operate that bike yourself.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.440]   And it's not something that most people want.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   I agree.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.480]   And I would love if I would love it if the iPhone were a platform that could do that
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.520]   could represent everything that I want a phone to be.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.760]   But that's not practical either.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.520]   Like Renee said, it's it's the I'll know what's my way to keep picking back on Renee.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.240]   One of the things that really that is also sort of tempting me about the iPhone is that
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.080]   it really is just a beautiful, elegant device.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:05.960]   People I think are designed at that level as well, but it really isn't isn't targeted
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:12.400]   towards people who really want to customize their experience and give themselves something
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.200]   that works a little bit better for them.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.840]   They really want something where they they they take out of the box, they charge it, they
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.040]   answer what language that they they use.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.200]   And then they're taking great pictures and posting them to Instagram.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.720]   And I have to say that I'm very, very I'm very, very tempted this year to upgrade to
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.200]   the iPhone 12.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.840]   And part of it is that it's like I understand that I understand that pixel.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   I understand that you're I believe in you.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.320]   I think you got a great plan.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.560]   I think that you're going through rebuilding year just like any just like any successful
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.040]   pro team has a rebuilding year where the saying, you know what we're going to we're going
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.880]   to get our relief pitching in order.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   We're going to figure out what our training training regimen is going wrong.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.560]   I'll be back in a couple of years.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.200]   But maybe it's time for me to switch back to the iPhone for a few years.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.400]   I have the opposite reaction.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.920]   So like I saw that everything with like Mark being fired or leaving.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.680]   He's the head of he was the head of Pixel camera for people who don't know.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.400]   Yeah, probably the biggest that that that Google had.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   And just he is.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:21.040]   Yes, guys, guys, guys, I said, reference say he is the inventor of like a of a night vision
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   and competition.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.560]   My my my I have some of the most fun I've ever had was with when he was the head of head
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.640]   of a professor at Stanford, he released a a a a multi app.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.840]   I think it's called multi cam for the iPhone like three.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.480]   And I just remember, yes, putting my phone on a tripod and taking these pictures of of
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.520]   a statue in in the public garden in Boston and seeing how it was differentiating between
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.800]   the things that were permanently there and things were coming and going.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.440]   So that's why we that's why it's a really big deal that they lost the super visionary
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   sort of guide.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   There are a lot there's still lots of great engineers there in the photo division, of
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   course.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.000]   But when you say that he's it's his ideas that that created night vision, which was a signature
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.720]   feature, his ideas that created HDR plus right super red zoom.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   That's scary.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   So I'm sorry.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.480]   I started from the thing from these I had and then Austro lows like I didn't know the
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   battery was bad.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.280]   It was like, I bought almost every nexus.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.840]   I bought almost every pixel.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.480]   I think about every pixel.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.600]   And I am probably not going to and now the next one is delayed and who knows how long
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.440]   and it might be delayed so much that the four a comes out with the fight and I'm taking
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   a pixel pods.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.720]   I'm going to I hope they can get their act together.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   I think they're real.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   I think they're vice president, their head of product and their head of engineering really
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.920]   need to get in the same room and decide they're making one phone and not three phones that
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.920]   they make a horrible hybrid in the last minute.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.280]   But I might actually go for like a Samsung Fold 2 or Flip 2 this year instead because
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   I'm not that they're making more interesting things.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.520]   I still like Google's software way better.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   But if the if the pixel continues to be shenanigans like this, I might try different something different
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   this year.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.560]   That will that will consistently be a signature advantage of the Android platform that maybe
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.520]   a foldable phone is not for everybody.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.320]   But for the people who really want one here are three different kinds to choose from or
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.520]   here is a 7.5 inch phone or area.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.640]   All these different weird aspect ratios, all these different weird form factors, even things
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.200]   that are small enough that you could put inside like cosmetic case.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.720]   Because I'll have an iPhone.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.760]   So if Joanna Stern puts a hot dog in my fold, it won't stop me for long.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.680]   Like it all be fine.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   Show title.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.280]   Joanna Stern put a hot dog in my galaxy fold.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:47.360]   I like the idea of having a technical barrier, but letting people do things if they can mount
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.520]   that technical barrier.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.800]   A good example is with Gatekeeper.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.120]   They're slowly making it more and more just, you know, you can't install anything that's
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.520]   not not a rise by Apple.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.200]   That's not from the Apple store.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   But what they've left and I hope they keep leaving it.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:05.520]   In fact, I got it from iMore is a command line you can enter that will give Gatekeeper that
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.160]   third permission again to install third party stores or third party sources.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.440]   And if you're sophisticated enough to know that command line and be able to use it, then
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.240]   you should be allowed to do that.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.360]   My point is that they won't let Homebrew for 32.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.520]   Their loss of 32-bit apps is just so bad for the music industry and for the gaming industry
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.640]   that I really want them to say like we're not going to do 32-bit compatibility anymore.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.760]   You want to download something from the open source community to do it.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.800]   Like other platforms are doing that's fine.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.160]   But I think that was one step too far.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.240]   Is there a risk that Homebrew won't work on Mac someday?
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.920]   Homebrew works is just 32-bit binaries.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.200]   My God kids wanted to do Portal, the level builder and it's still 32-bit and they can't
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   do it on the Mac.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.560]   They have to boot camp and do it on Windows.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.040]   I'm a little bit more supportive of Apple on that.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.280]   You kind of have one of the things Apple's really good at and in contrast to Microsoft
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   is leaving behind older technologies.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.760]   It's tough because then you're killing legacy things like Portal level builders.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.800]   Yeah, the developers are no longer around to make it.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.040]   It's all they don't want to make updates is that literally the people who made them
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   are no...
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   But it was 10 years ago.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.760]   It does make the operating system better to eliminate this old craft, I think.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.400]   I think it's making it a hobbyist thing.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.520]   Make it a thing that the open source community is like what they did when they stopped
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.080]   you including Pearl and all the different scripts and all the different services.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   Yeah, it's easy to install Python and Pearl with Pearl.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.040]   You don't need to, Apple.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.360]   If somebody needs it, they have the skills to do it.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   I just like that.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.240]   I like having a technical bar that makes sense on the Mac.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.400]   Would it make sense on an iOS device?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.880]   Is iOS really a walled garden?
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.640]   It's built to be that way.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.520]   Well, you have the Mexico thing.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.040]   That's your barrier of entry.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   I'm glad with that.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.240]   I'm going to have to try it.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.880]   It is what makes the iPhone elegant.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.840]   It's one of the reasons I don't want to try to break it.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.600]   Before test flight, and this probably happened to Lori too, if there was developers who ran
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.640]   out of beta slots, they would sometimes would just send you say, "You got to build it and
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.440]   sign it, but here's how you're going to beat it."
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   Okay.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.880]   By the way, 13.5 came out the day after Mac break weekly.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   Thanks.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   Thanks a bunch.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   That's quite frustrating.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.720]   And yes, the COVID tracking API is in there.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.360]   No, you can't do anything with it.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.640]   So I'll show you if you go into your settings and you go to privacy, can you zoom in on
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   that a little bit?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.040]   I don't know if you can, John.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.440]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   Look, he's got the amazing AmeriCorps Zoom.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   You go to privacy and then you go down to health.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.240]   There it is.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:48.280]   If you've got 13.5, COVID-19 exposure logging, and it's off by default, except that you can't
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.840]   turn it on because you have to have an authorized exposure logging app on there.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.360]   Once you do, you can see what exposure checks there are and you can delete the exposure
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   log.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.120]   And of course, it turns out this is Apple's and Google because they created the API for
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.920]   Android in conjunction with Apple's desire to keep it really private.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.680]   There's no personal information connected.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:21.000]   Your exposure log isn't sent to any authority saying, "Oh, Leo's got COVID-19."
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.520]   And for that reason, France, and it looks like most states, all but four states, are
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.760]   saying, "Yeah, we're not going to use that."
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.760]   They want, okay.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   I listened to the briefing.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.640]   They had a, sorry, mine just says, "Not available in your region."
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.840]   We're the most afflicted place in Canada and not available in your region.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.360]   But they had an off the books briefing on that.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.120]   And it was super interesting because they, some of those places badly want location data.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.080]   And Apple and Google are trying to explain to them, like, it explains to me like I'm
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.600]   a five-year-old version of why you don't need the location data.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   It is irrelevant.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.520]   They know how to do Bluetooth.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.520]   They know who you're around.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   There are still some problems.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.320]   Like, you pass somebody in a subway and they're standing on the platform.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.520]   You're not, there's no communication there, but you were still near them.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.320]   So there's still like things that have to be addressed with this.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.560]   But every bit of data that could be useful for what they're trying to do now, which is
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.240]   the notifications is available to them.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.000]   And there seems to be just a sticking point in the mentality, either ignorance because
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.920]   they don't know that they already have what they want or nefariousness because they believe
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.560]   that this is their gateway into getting something that they've never been able to get.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.360]   I'm going to fight you on this one.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.520]   I'll let you Andy, but after that, I'll fight.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.080]   To be fair, health organizations have two schools of thought on this.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.200]   They do acknowledge that a solution like Apple, Google's, is going to be a lot more palatable
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.160]   for the general public.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.560]   And the only way to make this sort of app useful to the community is to get 60 to 80%
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   of the people actually installing that and actually using it.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.080]   But the other, but the argument for having a centralized approach is that with that huge
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.400]   pile of data, assuming that's only, even if it's only available to healthcare organizations,
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.320]   you can crunch that data and create brand new models that sort of anticipate how this,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.000]   is spreading not just with people who have been diagnosed, but people who have not been
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   diagnosed.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.920]   A lot of this is community organized.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:16.680]   Google released a really interesting tool just last month for community leaders to basically
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.120]   say here is, please, please don't dig deep into how we have this data.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.400]   But here is how many, how active people have been at your areas of public recreation,
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   at shopping areas.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.160]   Here's how much travel they've been doing within your town.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.280]   Here's how much travel they've been doing outside your town and to other states.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.480]   And that's the sort of data that can allow a community or even a local government to decide,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.280]   you know what, we believe now that people are getting it.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.400]   We believe that the correlation between the numbers that we're seeing in new diagnoses
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.240]   and confirmed cases are related to how well people are sheltering in place and following
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   instructions.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.160]   Therefore, we believe that we can ease our restrictions or create new rules.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.720]   So that's the argument that they're making.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.920]   But I stick to my guns and saying that I don't want this sort of, I believe that if we might
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   have a Patriot Act situation, if we allow governments to have access to routine no-war
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.400]   and access to daily, daily tracking, that at first it will be to solve this immediate
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.120]   problem that absolutely affects every single person in this country.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.040]   And then it will be, well, you know what, we do have this power to do this.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:33.240]   Why don't we just say that terrorism or murder or drugs are a health problem and as such,
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.280]   we will simply take access to entire communities information about how people are moving around
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.560]   to do our drug enforcement.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.320]   And that would be almost impossible to roll back.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.920]   Laurie, you have any thoughts?
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:53.960]   Well, I guess what comes up for me is the way contact tracing has traditionally worked,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:00.880]   which is that somebody contracts the virus, let's say it's COVID-19 in this case.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.840]   And then there are health care workers who have to go out and physically go to all of
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.480]   those locations and tell the restaurant or the grocery store that somebody that had
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.760]   COVID-19 was in this store at this time, at this date, so that they can put their procedures
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   in place.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.640]   They have to call up each and every one of the people that that person who contacted it
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.400]   came in contact with that they know of, they know them personally and can get in contact
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.480]   with them.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.200]   So I think what might be happening right now with this desire to have centralized data
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.920]   is that that's how they've done it in the past.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.200]   And like Renee is saying that- It's the only way that works, but go ahead and that's
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.360]   why I'll tell you.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.600]   That's why I'll fight all three.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I'll fight all three.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.160]   Well, so it's the- Like this, Leon.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.560]   It's the only way that you know of that works.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   And I'm not even disagreeing with this idea of central-
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.400]   No, it's the only way that works.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.400]   Period.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.040]   But now Lotfi is going to do this.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.280]   There's some countries that are going to use the Google API, but I refer you to Bruce
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.920]   Schneier, who is no laggard on privacy, who says my problem with contact tracing apps
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.680]   is they have absolutely no value.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.160]   I'm not even talking about the privacy concerns.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.040]   I mean the efficacy.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.680]   The countries that have successfully stopped COVID with that there's no vaccine, there's
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.560]   no known way to do it.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.280]   There's no treatment in hospitals.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.400]   The countries that have successfully done this have done it one way and one way only with
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.880]   effective testing and contact tracing.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.760]   And that's human contact tracing.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   And the reason governments don't want to use what Apple's giving them is it's worthless.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.560]   They could use as an adjunct for human contact tracing, which I will repeat is the only effective
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   way.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.560]   It's what South Korea's done.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   It's what Taiwan did.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.640]   It's what China has done.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.360]   It's what the countries that are effectively reducing their cases to zero have to do.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.920]   It's what we will have to do except we never will do it because we're too liberty focused
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   and privacy.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.400]   Well, isn't there like you can make that right?
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.160]   Like anyone can make an app that asks for the government.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.920]   Like human contact tracing, but you still need humans to go out call people.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   And it's you know what?
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.480]   It's really tough medicine.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   We'll never do it in the US.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.720]   You might do it in Canada.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:15.080]   You'll never do it in the US because what it involves is I get tested positive.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.000]   They say tell me everywhere you've been in the last 14 days, every store, every restaurant,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   every person.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.640]   They then go to all those places and people.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.760]   They say you now need to quarantine for 14 days.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.640]   Plus we want to know everyone you've talked to since you ran into Leo.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.480]   But isn't the issue that they missed people because you don't know who you've been in
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   contact with them for the app?
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   It doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.200]   It has to reduce the R nut and it works and it has worked in every nation that does it.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   It has.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   I'm confused.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.440]   What's the difference then between this thing automatically reporting who you've been in
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.320]   contact with as opposed to you giving a verbal list?
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.960]   Well, I'll again refer you to the Bruce Schnaule article.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.800]   He talks about false positives, false negatives.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.280]   He talks about the idea that this is his final quote.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.040]   The contact tracing can be done with an app and not human health professionals is just
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   dumb.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.640]   Now I'm not as smart as Bruce Schnauer.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   I'm not as smart as you guys.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.080]   But if Schnauer says it doesn't work, I believe him.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.560]   It's just a different thing.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.800]   You think countries that are Singapore where they've done a very good job, Hong Kong with
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.000]   a very good job, Singapore, they had an app 20% adoption rate.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.480]   It didn't matter because it was humans that made the difference.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.920]   Now an app could help humans, but that's why the governments want the information.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.760]   Here's what I'm confused though.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.200]   The arguments I've heard about the app isn't that they don't think it's going to be useful.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.920]   It's that they wanted complete location access to everybody.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.480]   Apple and Google said no and they're angry about it.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.920]   But if the app doesn't work, then it doesn't matter if it gives them location data or Bluetooth
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.600]   beacon data because it's not useful anyway.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.920]   So in the end, the government still just wants an excuse to get our location data and at the
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.080]   least Apple and Google are saying no.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   Okay.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.200]   So, excuse to get all location data, privacy, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.280]   I got it.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.200]   You have a choice.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:06.040]   You can either stay in quarantine until a vaccine is developed if ever or you can have
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.840]   your privacy.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.040]   But would they give up your privacy?
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.080]   If they have location data, like if he says the apps don't work, you need humans and it's
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   irrelevant.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.320]   No, it's the subway train issue.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.120]   It's all of that stuff.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.040]   But the apps could be useful and this is why most governments, including all but four
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.760]   states in the United States, including California, are developing their own apps because an app
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.520]   could be useful in conjunction with human contact tracing.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.920]   But it's not by itself useful.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   Yes.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:40.080]   No matter what it does, and so you need humans and the app could be adjunct to humans.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.280]   But there's a lot of problems with an app anyway.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.440]   And the Apple app is useless, completely useless.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.280]   Even if the government can't.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.920]   It has to be part of a complete breakfast, is I think the point.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.480]   And every health expert says this, Andy, I'm sorry.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.520]   I'm going to have to stand by this.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.560]   There was a really good, if you watched CNN last night, Anderson Cooper interviewed, who's
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.160]   the guy who did the HIV stuff?
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.320]   He's really, really good.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.960]   He wears the German jacket.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.440]   But he was very clear and very adamant on this.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   You need human contact tracing.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.000]   So if the apps don't work anyway, I'm happy that I don't get any of my data while making
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   them.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It's a bottle for me.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.360]   I'm not sure if we actually disagree.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:30.160]   I absolutely agree with you that the need for human boots on the ground processing has
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.640]   been underestimated and underappreciated for this crisis.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.120]   A lot of this is Rhode Island got into a lot of trouble for doing something that was proactive
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.760]   and very, very, very simple.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.960]   Which is to say, we know we're the New Yorkers who own beach property, vacation property
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.220]   Rhode Island live.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.680]   We know we're the rental properties that attract most New Yorkers are.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.840]   So therefore, we're going to have people go out there and look for New York City license
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.760]   plates and then knock on a door to say, hi, you're from New York, great.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   We do know that you have to quarantine.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.800]   Who else you've been in contact with.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.200]   That's the sort of stuff that we're going to need at a much, much higher scale.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.960]   I just don't think I think, yeah, I agree with that it would be useless if that's what
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   we were counting on.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.320]   I mean, this is this is.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.400]   Shes is apps are techies doing techy things because they don't know what else to do.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.120]   It is not useful.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.400]   We need we need I think we need every club in the bag that we can that we can use again.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   And that's true.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   And that's why other that's why everybody.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.320]   Except for states and a handful of countries is doing something other than the Apple Google
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   thing.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   Well, it's the end.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   The end.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.400]   The other thing that we're not we're overlooking is that we have to make we can't have a solution
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.920]   that requires someone to have a phone of a certain vintage in order to run.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.200]   A lot of people are using pay as you go phones on pay as you go plans.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.560]   A lot of more people than we appreciate are using non smart phones.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:01.320]   So a solution that requires people to have access to a modern ish iPhone or a Android
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:08.560]   phone that connects us to Google Play Store is not a great idea because it's going to.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.920]   It's going to.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.120]   It's not going to benefit some of the people who are most vulnerable, which are the people
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.440]   who don't have a whole lot of money and are very, very dependent on being able to go.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.520]   Don't have the ability to say no when an employer is saying, Hey, we're reopening.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.680]   No, we can't have masks.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.080]   No, we're we're we're putting together a plan for disinfecting surfaces.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.520]   We don't have it together yet.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.800]   But if you want to keep you can if you don't come in and start working regardless, you will
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.480]   still lose your unemployment benefits.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.800]   So you have no choice.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.640]   So we have to make sure we have solutions that work for everybody.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   You know, obviously the notion of widespread testing and contact tracing is not going to
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.000]   ever happen in the United States.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.440]   So the consequence of that is waves more many, many, many more people dying, waves of quarantine.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.400]   And that's and you know, we'll talk in a year and nothing.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.960]   You can't even get people to wear masks.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.720]   We can't even get them to wear masks.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.880]   By the way, masks work too.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.920]   If everybody wears them.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.160]   But I still see lots of people wearing and selling masks that have valves that allow you
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.640]   to hear air to expect to go out, which is exactly the wrong kind of mask to wear.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.280]   I mean, it's just, you know, you could you could get political and say that leadership
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.720]   in this country has not been very good.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   That's part of it.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   But it's happening all over the world.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.960]   It's been terrible in Quebec.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   He's been changing his mind.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   We were opening all the schools.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   Oh, no, they're getting sick again.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   Close the schools.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   We're opening the door.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.720]   The place where it works is where the politicians step down and the health experts step up.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.320]   And then that's who gives the briefings.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.240]   And that's who tells you what to do.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.640]   And when you wish people based on things that that involve leadership and managerial
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.240]   skill, you look at New Zealand.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.600]   You know, excellent prime minister, but her real skill was letting the health experts
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.400]   decide what a New Zealand does.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.080]   Now it's easy in an island nation.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.320]   And we're a very large nation.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.920]   Spread the hell out all over the place.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.280]   It's going to be very difficult.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.320]   We also are founded on the notion of personal liberty.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   So there's no way.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   But we all wear pants, Leo.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.440]   Like, like, like, the thing with these, like, there's people going into stores yelling
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.000]   about their right not to wear a mask.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   They're wearing pants.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.760]   They understand no shoes, no shirts.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   They were fine with that.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   Because now we have YouTube and everyone wants to be.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   No.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.240]   It feels like, like, dinosaurs were killed by a meteor from space and we're all going
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.040]   to die by a comet of our own stupidity.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.280]   That's just how it feels to me.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.880]   Anyway, I just want to-- I'm sorry.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   I didn't mean to--
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   I don't know.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   I absolutely just want to--
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.600]   I think it's really important.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.440]   Because I think when you focus on the Google Apple thing, we miss really a much broader
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.440]   point.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.840]   And I think Bruce Schnier convinced me that the-- you know, the article's really good
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   because he gives the scenario.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.400]   He says, all right, fine.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.080]   So when you take the app grocery shopping with you and it alerts you of a contact, what
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.280]   should you do?
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.320]   It's not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.600]   And without ubiquitous cheap, fast and accurate testing, you can't confirm the diagnosis.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   So the alert's useless.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.280]   Similarly, assume you take the app out grocery shopping and it doesn't alert you of any
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   contact.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Are you in the clear?
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.560]   Well, obviously not.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.240]   You actually have no idea if you've been infected.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.080]   That's a huge problem that I've got.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.200]   Like, I saw a huge article yesterday about saying, you know, airplanes are safe because
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.160]   they-- like, airplanes are very low risk.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.480]   They're very safe because they circulate and filter the air.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.360]   But you could be sitting next to someone who's infected.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.560]   You could be sneezed on by going down the aisle by-- like, none of this stuff is being
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   reported very well.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.640]   Here's an article from April 27th from the Brookings Institution.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.480]   Contact tracing apps are not a solution.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.560]   I mean, we can go on and on and on.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.960]   I think the health experts have been very clear about this.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   I trust them.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.400]   And you know when it comes to technology?
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   I trust Bruce Schnier.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   I'm not as smart as any of them.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.640]   But you have to know who to listen to.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.520]   And the other larger thing, just relating it back to technology, is that we have-- the
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.280]   people who create the technology have the greatest amount of faith in technology.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.760]   They don't understand-- when the-- when the-- when a whole bunch of people who have the
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:59.320]   means to-- money is the fuel for change and that the programs don't get off the ground
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.400]   until you have money to actually fund them.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.520]   And when a whole bunch of people got together saying, how do we prove the lot of children,
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.600]   the idea was, ooh, let's make-- let's find a way to make a $100 version of a $500 laptop
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.760]   and that's what that will help children's education everywhere.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:19.160]   Instead of having the more practical thought of, well, how about we fund the creation of
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.800]   roads so that people can get from one place to another.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:29.920]   Let's make sure that teachers are funded, so that it's-- let's make sure that we improve
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.720]   the living conditions of the family so that parents don't feel as though they can't afford
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.120]   to lose their child for several hours a day.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.320]   The one of the biggest problems we have ongoing-- I'm talking about year to year to year-- is
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.160]   the old adage that Silicon Valley is really, really good at solving problems that can be
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.040]   felt by a 20 to 30 year old engineer making $300,000 a year.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   Exactly.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.280]   Renee, you broke my heart.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.960]   Why the iPhone 12 still won't be going USB-C.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   Now that's--
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.360]   I mean, there was a rumor yesterday there was a prototype, but they decided against it.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.680]   Do you think that's credible that it's still going to be lightning this year?
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.960]   Yeah, I think that, you know, it was a confluence of several things.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.000]   One, that Apple was working on USB-C, but there was no way that they were going to get
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.960]   it standardized in time, and they wanted to make the iPhone 5, so they made lightning,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.160]   which had almost the same characteristics.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.000]   Just a few things Apple liked better than the USB committee, so we got that, and it just
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.040]   wasn't tenable three years later to switch to USB-C after so many people had gotten lightning.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.720]   And now it sounds like they're going to be moving to a smart connector, because most
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.040]   of the stuff that they want to do, they can do wirelessly, and for things that still don't
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.280]   work wirelessly, like DfU mode, or charging, you know, when wireless charging is unavailable
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:52.640]   or it's just not fast enough, or anything you need to tether for can be handled now over
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.480]   a smart connector, which is more robust.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.800]   Like there's less physical issues that can happen with it.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   Well, that's--
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   It can happen when they're lightning USB-C.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   So when they--
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.560]   So that was the rumor yesterday was forget USB-C this year, and in fact forget it entirely
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   until they can go out with completely connectionless--
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560]   Like on your iPad.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:16.000]   But you're saying the iPad smart connector, that actually makes sense.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.880]   That helps with waterproof, right?
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.920]   It does give you a fast way to charge it or to reset it with DfU mode without having
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   a hole in it.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.240]   Yeah, the problem with lightning and USB-C is that they are waterproof, but people plug
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.840]   into them right away, and then it shorts, because it's not electrically waterproof.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.520]   So he's told to be careful.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.000]   And the smart connector is magnetic.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.320]   You would assume there would be a magnetic connector on this phone.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   So that's not like--
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.400]   So don't worry if you need to charge your phone on the go.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.920]   Just simply set up a dock on the subway seat next to you and slide it in.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.560]   Yeah, what would that look like?
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.320]   How would you--
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   You have an adapter for now, especially for things like wired car play, which people
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.320]   immediately freaked out about, because cars do not change.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.840]   Like people had dock connectors for 10 years after the iPhone went to lightning.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.800]   Yeah, we have a Chevy Bolt that it's great.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.840]   Car play works, but you have to plug in the lightning board.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   So you're saying they'll be a little thing that'll go on the magnet, and it'll give
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.400]   the lightning port.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.960]   Yes, like the same way the magic keyboard makes a USB-C connection over smart connector
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   for the current--
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   Actually, that's a concept, isn't it?
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   Because I charge my--
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   Now I don't get data, but I do charge my iPad Pro with that.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.800]   No, the data is being used for something else.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.920]   And they'll probably have higher capacity.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.760]   The thing is, lightning was great for its time.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.200]   It was way better than micro-mini-B USB.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.400]   But Apple hasn't needed to improve it.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.000]   So it doesn't go past USB 2.0 speed, except for the camera connection kit.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.720]   It doesn't have Thunderbolt, because Apple never put PCIe out on any of those devices.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.160]   So in general, the speeds are slower.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   The power charging capabilities are slower.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.520]   And they could go to USB-C, but that's a mammoth change, especially if it's going to
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.960]   just change it again in a year or two anyway.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.440]   Yeah, plus I assume that the fact that you have a solution with the smart connector that
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.960]   doesn't require any ingress at all, not only does it happen, does it improve dust and
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:08.160]   dust ingress and moisture ingress, but also it means that that's more internal space,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   that they don't have to devote.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   But you're going to have speakers, right?
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.200]   I mean, you're going to have some of those in the case.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.480]   The speakers have that weird baffling thing that pushes water out as it pulls it in.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.280]   They have a bunch of more smart stuff for that.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   Okay.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   Like on your Apple watch.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.120]   Makes it like a little buzz and it spits the water.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.720]   Also, every time you insert a lightning connector or USB connector, you're pushing into it.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.400]   And I suppose that's another problem.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.960]   I don't hate this idea.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.720]   I still think that a more internationally standardized connector is the way to go.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.960]   But if as I always say, take something away from me, that's fine, but give me something
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.600]   back in return.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:55.200]   And I don't think that the edge, I don't think that protecting me from my not being
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.280]   able to take care of my phone is a huge advantage.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:07.200]   And if it were to enable a new line of accessories such as a sort of a portable dock that says,
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.240]   okay, well, you're still handy.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.640]   You're still upset that you don't have a USB C and you don't have a headphone jack.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   Well, great.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   Here is a case that you drop the phone in that will actually add an extra half inch
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.120]   to the bottom, but will give you that.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.440]   All those things plus HDMI Mini or micro.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.720]   It may be a camera system.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.200]   If that mean that I'm sure that the black magic and other makers would absolutely eat
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   that up.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:39.120]   So if it enables the catch 22, the iPhone has always been this one of the most powerful
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.920]   CPUs in my office is always the one that's inside an iPhone, but it's stuck inside a
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.200]   best pocket sized phone.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.480]   So I can't make full use out of it.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   But if you were to able to, if I wanted to spend $400 for a really awesome camera sled
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:03.120]   for it or a $300 for really awesome productivity sled for it, if it allowed me to say, yes,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.960]   I spent $1,000 for the top of the line pro level phone, but it allows me to not have to
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.760]   carry so much around with me, nor to buy so many external things.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.120]   That's why I don't hate that idea.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.120]   That's a very interesting idea.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   I love it.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   Like it bifurcated.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.720]   I would like it if the iPhone 12, I'm calling it the iPhone 12 Mini because it's just going
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.720]   to be cute and small.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:29.360]   The iPhone 12 Mini and the iPhone 12 had, or I, sorry, iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 had
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.480]   the smart connectors and the pros got USB-C for exactly the same reasons the iPad Pro
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   does.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.640]   It's like it just feels like if you put the word pro on it, like MacBook Pro, iPad Pro,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.760]   iPhone Pro, those kind of people would benefit from a super high speed charging, super high
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.280]   speed connections, all the things that you get with USB-C.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.520]   And they're also the only people on earth who can tell a USB-C, a USB-C PD and a Thunderbolt
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.520]   3 cable apart because why we get the same connector and all the cables are different.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.840]   The one thing I think of is the fact that this would now officially mean that every
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:09.320]   single person with an iPhone of this year absolutely couldn't use wired headphones under
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   any circumstance.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.440]   They couldn't use an adapter, they couldn't plug it into a 3.5 millimeter jack.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:20.680]   They would have to be Bluetooth headphones or GTFO.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.160]   Or smart connector adapters for headphones.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.000]   I don't think that would work though.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.880]   A magnetic smart adapter I don't think would work.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:32.760]   I think the movement of our heads and where we place our phones, I don't think a smart
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.960]   connector would be a safe connection for it.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.000]   Well, the case there, you make it a case that hits the Pogo plugs on the back and then
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   it gives you an audio app.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.800]   But is this something that Apple would offer for free?
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.040]   We've had these smart connectors for a while.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.080]   I don't see a huge number of third party smart connector devices.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.240]   It's an expensive licensing.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:58.320]   I know I've talked to some developers of keyboards that it's just too cost prohibitive for them
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.760]   to be able to keep the case price down.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.800]   So Apple, particularly when Bluetooth is free.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.280]   If you're going to do this Apple, it would be nice if you lowered the licensing fee because
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.480]   it would be fun to have.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.680]   I mean, at least we should have a little that has a USB-C on it as well as that.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.360]   It's not so much the licensing fee.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.640]   It's that Apple goes through so many.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   There was a problem with lightning.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.240]   A lot of people think that Apple sticks with lightning because of the money, the mass amounts
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.880]   of money they make off MFI.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.720]   They make less money than it's in Tim Cook's sofa cushions.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.800]   They waste more money on chamfering.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   They make up the money.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.600]   You have to come up with a better analogy than the money that I would happily take and
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.000]   in lieu of having not been able to do the money.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   It's probably six figures.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I'm thinking.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.200]   No, but it's six figures for a company that makes 75 billion on an iPhone.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   But the thing is that they literally couldn't make enough chips.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.240]   It wasn't so much the licensing fee.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.040]   You had to be licensed.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.960]   Was a process, yes, but you literally could not buy the chips because Apple was sucking
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.000]   every chip they could make out of the supply chain.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.440]   Yeah, but I love Andy's vision of a variety of devices going on that smart connector.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.600]   And Apple, it would behoove Apple to make that doable.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.400]   Yeah, but they'd have to make the chips not not like they could make the fee zero.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.200]   And if you can't get a chip, you can't get a chip.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.680]   So make the chips Apple.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   You have resources.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.200]   I'm sure they're thinking of it.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.800]   I'm sure they want to do it.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.400]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.800]   Andy Inaco, Renee Richie, Lori Gill.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.600]   Yeah, I like Annie's.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.120]   I'm Andy.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.360]   He raised his hand.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   I'm Laurie.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.720]   I just want to say hello.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Hello.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   Hello.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   It's what the members of the Hollywood Square as we do when they're in a row.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   And Rosemary.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.960]   Hey, or hold up a card that says, I cannot go to blind.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.000]   I'm not wearing pants.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.240]   We Alex has taken the week off.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   I know.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.320]   Was he forced to or was he gladly taking the week off to go to work?
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   We never know what Alex.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   Did they find something in his Twitter feed?
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.360]   Why can't it be both Leo?
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   I can't.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   But I'm sure Alex will be back next week.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.960]   Our show today brought to you by CashFly, quite literally.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.120]   It's our CDN, our content delivery network.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:11.520]   It brings you the shows, whether you download them on the website or you download them
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.560]   from iTunes or you subscribe.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.600]   It's all coming from CashFly.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.000]   And we've been doing that for years.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.440]   In fact, we deliver, CashFly delivers for us petabytes of data every month.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.920]   We do that for a few reasons.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:30.200]   One, because it saves us a lot of money versus just downloading it from our website or on
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   Amazon S3 bucket or something.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.720]   Two, because you always get it fast.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.040]   You never, you know, and this is probably something you never noticed.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.200]   You would notice though, if we're hesitant or slow or you couldn't get the podcast, I
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.760]   know you'd notice it then.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.920]   That's why I love CashFly.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:52.320]   It's been delivering content and innovating on this over the last 21 years since 1999.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.640]   In fact, they've got a new innovation that I really love.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.120]   And I'm going to try to explain this to people who don't use CDNs.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:05.200]   But if you do, you know what happens if you get a cash miss, right?
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.040]   Oh, the content is not in the cash.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.520]   That means you have to go out and transfer that content over to the cash server from
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.240]   whatever the source is.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.640]   And that can really cost you money and slow you down.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.880]   CashFly has a new solution.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   It's called 100% Cash Shield.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.480]   And with this new feature, you're going to benefit from a drastic reduction in data transfer
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:35.440]   fees with whatever you use, AWS is S3 and any cloud storage origin, by increasing your
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.480]   cash hit ratio to 100%.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.760]   You eliminate cash misses.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.080]   And boy, customers love it because they don't want buffering.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.600]   They don't want any delay.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.320]   They want everything to zip, zip, zip.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.720]   You can't do that if your cash items are being evicted for large one-off requests costing
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.880]   you a fortune in data transfer out fees.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.680]   But you won't have to with 100% Cash Shield and CashFly's guaranteed availability, you
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.080]   avoid it completely.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.120]   It's a next generation content delivery solution.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:09.560]   What it is basically is a dedicated storage space just for you on CashFly.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.360]   That way you keep your content and data closer to your customers.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.160]   You don't have to transit across other companies' networks.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.040]   You can purchase as much space as you want or need.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:25.320]   And your data will always be fetched from 100% Cash Shield rather than from your origin.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.360]   That means shielding reduces your origin spend by as much as thousands a month.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.720]   No Cash Misses.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.560]   It also remarkably improves download speeds, eliminates buffering, guaranteed availability,
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.560]   the highest quality of service.

[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   your origins.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.960]   Look, I shouldn't have to sell this to you.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.640]   I am such a believer.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.680]   We've used this for almost 10 years on Twitter now.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   I wouldn't do anything else.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:32.520]   We've been approached many times and I've always said, "No, I love CashFly."
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.120]   See how much CashFly could save you?
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:39.560]   You can get a detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.400]   Right now, if you go to twit.cashfly.com, it's not a hard sell.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.960]   They're not going to push you.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.440]   They're just going to help you.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.240]   See if you're paying 20% or more than you have to for a content delivery network.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.800]   If you're not on a CDN, see how much CashFly can make a difference.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.880]   twit.cashfly.com.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.400]   You've got to use CashFly.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.680]   That's what we've been using forever.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   We love it.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   CashFly.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   twit.cashfly.com.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:12.840]   Let's see.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.800]   What was the bug?
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.880]   Maybe Laurie, you know this one.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.720]   This app is no longer shared bug.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:24.280]   I read that article and I have not heard of this bug.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.640]   It must not have been a very big one.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.480]   I'm sure it existed, but I have not come across that or read anything about it other
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.960]   than MacRumors' comments on that.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.280]   That was new to me.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.480]   I installed 13.5 right away and never had a problem.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   Apparently.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.560]   I just hadn't read it anywhere.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.000]   It wasn't big enough.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.880]   I'm sure that there's plenty of people who have experienced it otherwise it wouldn't
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.240]   have been talked about in any forums, but it just wasn't big enough to catch my attention.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:58.320]   You may not notice it because it was something that went wrong in the apps with 13.5 and
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.840]   these apps were immediately updated.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.280]   Most people only noticed it because they got two updates in a row or they got a quick
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.920]   update to an update on the apps.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:14.800]   MacRumors' posits might be an expired certificate or other credential related to app sharing
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.680]   and then Apple has had to reissue those updates to include a valid certificate.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   That's their theory.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.400]   Yeah, I was just curious because I didn't see it either.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.920]   Maybe only Mac Rumor readers saw that.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   Maybe who reads I'm more had a problem.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.880]   Maybe it's a Mac Rumor problem.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.240]   It's only Mac Rumor readers that gets that problem.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.080]   This should be very good news if they do this 9 to 5 Mac reports that Apple is going to do
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:46.440]   a catalyst version of the messages app on Mac.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.360]   This is really interesting to me for only, well for two reasons.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:57.640]   One of them is the simple thing of like we get to have an emoji, an emoji and stickers
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   on the Mac.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.760]   Something that's been missing from the messages app on Mac.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.480]   Yeah, the screen changes and things.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.760]   We've not been able to use those on Mac.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.840]   I love this idea.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:19.400]   But also this is the first time that catalyst has been used to fully replace an existing
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   app on the Mac.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:26.360]   So this is an interesting step in that direction of they tested the waters by putting brand
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.480]   new catalyst apps on Mac like the stocks app.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:36.360]   Then they further tested the waters by changing something like iTunes which includes podcasts
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:41.520]   into two separate apps which is the music app and the podcast app which is on catalyst
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   catalyst.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.360]   But this is actually replacing app for app, the messages app.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:53.200]   If this does happen and I'm wondering what does that mean for the future of built in
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.520]   apps using catalyst on the Mac in the future?
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.960]   Do you think, so one reason to do it is so you have feature parity with the phone.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   Right.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   So it's exactly the same.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   It's, you know, I understand.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.160]   But maybe not with the Mac because the Mac does things the phone doesn't.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.520]   Like you can screen share from the buddies menu which you can't do on iOS and I hope
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.520]   they don't lose things either.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.520]   So you may lose things.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.520]   I hope not.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.360]   I mean the functionality is there.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.400]   I just hope that they implement it.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.720]   It would also be a really nice demo of catalyst.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.920]   I'm sure they're anxious to show people what a great job catalyst can do with your existing
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.280]   iOS apps, supporting them to the Mac, right?
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   Playground was pretty good.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.360]   I think that's probably the best job they've done so far.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   The Swift Playground that they moved from all of us.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   And they've done it with voice memos.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.200]   They've done it with the podcast app, the stocks app, not exactly.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   Challenging.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   It'd be really interesting.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.240]   I thought it was the catalyst apps that were bad and then I realized it's all those media
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   apps.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   It's just bad.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   It's just bad apps.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.480]   Interesting if you did it with catalyst and showed that you could have Mac specific features.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.720]   Well, like multi-window because you can click on a message and it pops up into its own
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.440]   window, which is not a feature.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.600]   Like you can tear out things on the iPad, but you can't.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.080]   If I'm messaging Laurie, I can just double click on that make this on window.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.800]   I can do all sorts of Mac and Mac things on it right now.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.040]   You can even old school slash status and say like how I'm feeling.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.440]   And really how many of those make it over?
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.360]   It's it's it was a repurposed I chat.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.760]   It's got Daniel Jalka's little fingerprints all over it.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:31.660]   Would it take John Gruber tweeted it would kill it would be the end of the line for Apple
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.200]   script.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.820]   He says to be clear if Apple does go the catalyst route with Mac messages, I'd expect Apple
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.840]   script to be D.O.A.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.120]   Shortcuts would be the well there it is.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   Sure.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.680]   Sure cuts on Mac OS, which seems possible.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.040]   This would be so this is one of those bell weather things.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:59:00.280]   Now by the way, this all comes from Iowa the iOS 14 mysterious floating around never released
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   beta version.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.800]   The internal build the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:12.280]   So is it possible that it's meaningless and that it is 14 is just full of strange things
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.200]   that will never make it to the real world.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   It's full of possible.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   Totally possible.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   All right.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.840]   So we'll treat it like that though.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.160]   But I thought it was interesting the Gruber took that seriously that would be meaningful.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:31.240]   And that is one of probably, you know, that's a Mac feature, Mac only feature that most
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.480]   people don't care about or use.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.720]   But those who do care a lot about.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.960]   But I mean, it's it's I want to say embarrassing because they debuted the new messages for iOS
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.120]   three, four years ago.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   I mean, the people who debuted on stage now run their own startup.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.440]   That's how long ago it was.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.680]   And it still does bracket sent with fireworks bracket like I'm a third class citizen.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.840]   Just that sort of stuff.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   And they unified those teams two, three years ago.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.160]   That kind of stuff just it's a lack of resources on the max side and they need to either increase
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:10.760]   the resources or increase the efficiency and catalyst increases the efficiency.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.160]   Let's talk about TV.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.200]   We're all a little bit more interested in TV than we used to be.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.880]   I did not see the Friday mythic quest.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.080]   Did you the episode?
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   I haven't seen that episode yet.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.040]   So I stopped watching mythic quest because it was so annoying.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.960]   But I might.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.360]   What episode did you stop on?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.000]   I really loved the flashback episode.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.760]   Okay, you did watch that one.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.960]   Yeah, I thought that was fantastic.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.400]   We talked about it.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.600]   It had nothing to do with anything.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   Right.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.800]   It was just dropped in the middle and that was good.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.920]   And then the next episode after that I think was the one I stopped watching because it went
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.840]   back to its old ways.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:00.560]   Including, you know, some I think a lot of stereotypes of people that I don't like.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.400]   I feel bad that F. Murray Abraham is forced to be a doddering old man and a blowhard.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.640]   You know, this is partly because it comes from Rob McElany who did it's always sunny
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.280]   in Philadelphia and that's kind of his his style.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.800]   So if you haven't seen and I will I'll just skip right ahead to this episode just because
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.880]   I'm curious that all shot on iPhone, it's the quarantine version.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   They're all at home.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.920]   They have some interesting information.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:43.880]   I got two iPhones and 20 cents of earbuds to I guess the team.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.880]   And they wrote the episode with McElany wrote it with David Hornsby's also in the show and
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.080]   Megan Gans was the show's co-creator.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.680]   They wrote it in three weeks.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680]   Not just wrote it in three weeks.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   They shot it.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   They edited it and they got it ready to air in three weeks.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.320]   And in fact, Apple liked it so much, they're submitting it for Emmy consideration.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   Did you see it?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   Have you seen it?
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.320]   Anybody?
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.280]   I haven't had the opportunity yet.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.960]   I would never have known except for this, you know, the article and actually the only
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.720]   reason I know is because Michael Sargent said it was really good.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.120]   So, or Michael, we trust.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   And Michael, we trust.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:30.800]   I'm really impressed with the way creators are navigating remote entertainment.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.840]   And when you can really do something special with it, I think it was the Parks and Rec had
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.800]   something kind of similar where they made an episode, they called it the reunion episode,
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.680]   they put it up on YouTube.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.960]   And it was pretty high quality and well edited.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   It was written.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.240]   It was scripted.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:57.520]   And it used the shelter in place order to help further the story along.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.480]   And you got all the jokes and all the funny things in it, but it was this kind of perspective
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.320]   like what I'm looking at right now, which is your face in front of a computer screen.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:14.520]   And it's really fun to watch how creators are turning the means they have into something
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.600]   fun and interesting and creative.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.040]   What was the primetime drama that had an episode that was nearly done, but they had to finish
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:28.600]   it using CGI, like not even convincing CGI, but just, okay, well, look, we got good.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.600]   You said cartoon of what we were going to do.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.360]   Wasn't it a black list where they went to an animated ending?
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   Wow.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   That's weird.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.440]   Well, it's weird, but it's fascinating.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:45.400]   It made me think that what if part of the knock on effects is that we realize that, gee,
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:52.000]   why haven't we been doing weekly dramas in animation?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.840]   Like, well, not talking about like last minute, let's say we were doing this because of coronavirus
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.840]   animation, but what if you had the situation where now we can actually set scenes wherever
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.800]   they want and we can have crowd scenes as big as we want?
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:13.400]   And if we, if, and in terms of isolation and coronavirus, it would probably not be that
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   difficult to have.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.960]   We have a motion capture to create a motion capture stage that can be operated by minimal
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.720]   people on site.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.000]   And the other thing would be we can't, you can't get Tom Hanks to do an entire story arc
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.440]   on the black list or something like that.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.920]   But if you said, actually, if Tom says, you know what, I have 17 days off.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.360]   I love your show.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.280]   Like if I can get in and out and do all of my scenes in two weeks, you got me.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:48.440]   Would be it's a lot of problems that get solved very interestingly.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:54.640]   The other thing that's really cool is that they had a side story about a charitable donation
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:02.280]   and they raised in real life $600,000 for Mercy Corps in their COVID-19 relief program.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.320]   So you'd be really cheerless of you to hate on this show anymore.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.840]   So I'm going to now love this show and I will watch it and give a donation to it.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.840]   That's pretty cool.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.280]   Of course, it's no accident that it's on Apple TV plus.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.680]   So of course, Apple sent 40 iPhones immediately.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.080]   It's like, yeah, sure.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.880]   That's a good idea.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.240]   Let's show off what we can do.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.760]   I like that.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.320]   That modern family did an iPhone episode, right?
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   A FaceTime episode.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.800]   A FaceTime episode, right?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   So this is not unprecedented.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.680]   They had one where the father was trying to buy an iPad and then years later they had
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.440]   one where they'd only talk over FaceTime.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   Right.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440]   Right.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.560]   And they made up versions of FaceTime for the Mac that I still wish existed today.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.560]   Simple, gimmicky.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   I don't know.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   Does it work?
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560]   I don't know.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:53.480]   Also, you can't do the finale of the Silence of the Lambs with point of view shots by people
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   holding up phones.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.760]   You need two actors together playing off each other.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:05.280]   Well, any other, there are some new Apple TV plus shows.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.400]   I just started watching the one with the young female, the young girl reporter.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.160]   I'm blanking on the name now, but she moves back to her family's hometown and promptly
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.160]   sniffs out crime.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   It's all about.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   Yeah, I saw it.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.040]   It's a little bit over the top, but it's pretty good.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.960]   And it seems like they're collecting the Avengers because Rufalo has some show on with
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.120]   and Captain America has a courtroom drama.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.240]   And it's all it's like they're not they're not holding back on budget.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.240]   That's one thing.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.760]   Then they are starting to acquire back catalog a lot of back catalog because they realize
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.120]   if you're going to subscribe to a channel, you can't just have the hot news shows.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.880]   We can't make the hot new shows now.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   Like that's their biggest problem.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.520]   I think that their original plan was to turn out high rate because they're they're putting
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.800]   out stuff faster.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.160]   I think then a lot of other networks are putting it out.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.080]   They just had new shows almost every week or every month, but now nothing is in production.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.920]   And that's a huge gap, especially when you're running out of free free users.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.480]   So apparently Apple has gone to a lot of content companies and said, you know, we'd
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.360]   like some back catalog.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.560]   They've also been doing pretty well.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.440]   They're not they are surging, not the most surging, but they've done pretty well during
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.800]   the crisis.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800]   Apple.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.520]   This is business insider Apple TV plus signups in March and April.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:28.840]   We're no greater than February, according to antenna suggesting that the growth is slow
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.360]   compared to others during the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.800]   Okay, I take it back.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.720]   I thought they were doing well.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720]   Apparently they're not.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:43.640]   I think the story here is that, well, you know, Disney plus and Netflix saw huge surges.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.160]   The Apple TV plus service didn't see significant changes.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   They didn't see drops.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.680]   They just didn't see significant increases.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.520]   I think if I remember the rest of that story, though, like viewership, like retention seems
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:03.920]   to be 10% up, which is evidence that more people that already subscribe are actually watching
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   shows now.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.840]   Our audiences are warming up to their shows.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:13.720]   Defending Jacob, the Chris Evans show is apparently a breakout hit.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.880]   They just announced a new sports docu series.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.240]   You can do those because you don't have to shoot new video greatness code, which will
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.720]   feature episodes on Tom Brady, LeBron James, Usain Bolt.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.000]   And I don't, did we talk about this last week?
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   I can't remember.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.480]   I don't think it had happened yet.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.360]   They made a deal with Tom Hanks Film Company.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.640]   Greyhound, which was going to be released in theaters.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.280]   Obviously won't be.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.440]   There was a bidding war.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:47.800]   Sony Pictures ended up going with Apple for $70 million.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.800]   Not to make the movie.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.360]   It's already made just for the exclusive rights to stream it.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.840]   That's telling about the company's faith that we'll be able to reopen anything and any
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.760]   numbers by the end of the year.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.080]   You'll notice that the Black Widow movie has been postponed, not simply moved, that the
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.640]   Wonder Woman movie has been again simply delayed until the end of the year.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:17.120]   But when you get to an Oscar-based sort of movie where I don't think that there was a
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.400]   lot of high hopes are going to be making their money back to begin with, it was probably
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.040]   prestige thing, that says a lot because those companies are seeing a lot better numbers
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.520]   on likelihood than any of us are.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.720]   Does it mean movie theaters are dead?
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   I don't think so.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   You know?
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.880]   They still make more money with a theatrical release, you think?
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.680]   I mean, 70 million is not 300 million.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:47.080]   I mean, Disney's policy has always been either show me a $1 billion worldwide growth.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.960]   Those who go home.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.200]   And they're not going to be making that on video on demand.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.680]   But it'll be interesting to see how this shakes up releases like, again, a World War
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:05.160]   II period drama or something that's even lower budget than something that can afford to hire
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   Tom Hanks.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.960]   Those screens are the best way to get your billion dollars worldwide.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:16.080]   But maybe it's not the sort of place where the prestige, if you want Captain America
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.880]   to sign on outside of his contract for another Marvel movie, maybe this is not the place
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.760]   to put his movie that you agreed to make because he wants to be seen as a serious actor.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.680]   How many of you will sign up for HBO Max tomorrow?
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.680]   I found out that I've already been signed up for.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:43.600]   There's like, I got an email from AT&T saying, oh, by the way, you're, yeah, exactly.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.480]   Like I didn't because my phone is on AT&T and like, okay.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.760]   It's so confusing.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.640]   You actually have to.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.240]   This is a screw up, in my opinion.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.960]   So many ways you could get it for free and it's not immediately apparent.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.520]   I mean, so you have to spend some energy figuring out and you would be foolish to spend the
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.400]   $11.99 a month and then find out, oh, I got it for free.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:14.240]   If with AT&T or my cable company or if there seems like a dozen different ways you could
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.760]   get it for free.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.040]   HBO has this HBO has as many different digital packages than Google has messaging platforms.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.280]   And that's saying something.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280]   I've never.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   I've never.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:35.680]   I think a pretty good and as usual, extremely complicated piece on who's going to get it
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.960]   for free and who isn't in all of this.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.400]   I have to say, and now you guys love the comic books.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.600]   And I know there's a lot of comic book content in there.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.800]   It does look like there's going to be some nice deep catalog.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.200]   It's a good way to get HBO.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:58.280]   If, for instance, if you already pay for HBO with the HBO go, you till it app, you'll get
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.280]   HBO Max.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.160]   You'll just be upgraded automatically to that.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.760]   This is so confusing to me.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   It's terrible.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   I can explain it.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.960]   What's I understand the difference between HBO go and HBO Max, but what I don't understand
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.160]   is why HBO go exists anymore.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.720]   Now that HBO Max is the same price.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.200]   Now, see, this is the other.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   Sorry, HBO.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.440]   No, I said go.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440]   You're right.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.720]   Go is the one you get if you already pay for HBO with a cable company.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.720]   Yes.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.440]   Now is the one you know, you pay a la carte for HBO.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.240]   So if you're an HBO now, subscribe or you'll get HBO Max.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.160]   What's your favorite?
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:45.800]   So then what's HBO Max then if it's different than HBO now and why does HBO now exist if
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.840]   HBO Max is the same thing, but with extra content.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.160]   It's very confusing.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.360]   It's those two very specifically because I get it.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.880]   Max is the one that comes with exclusive content, but it's the exact same price as now.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.640]   So why would anybody have HBO now once Max comes out?
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.240]   Why would they subscribe to it when they can get the exact same price?
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.320]   They just because you want Zack Snyder's just as Lee cut.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.600]   Oh, I don't know which is on Max, right?
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   Yeah, only.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.240]   So why would you?
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.480]   Why would you subscribe to HBO now at all?
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.600]   No, I would like Paul Dooney to make a dark side movie instead.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600]   Thank you.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.320]   I just checked in Canada and it says that there's no HBO Max Canada, but some of the content
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.800]   will show up on Bell Media's Crave TV because of content licensing deals, but not all of
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.120]   it because they sold some to Netflix earlier instead.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   Oops.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.840]   I hope you get the new Seth Rogen piece in American pickle.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.040]   He plays a nice.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.480]   There is a picture of Seth Rogen like you've never seen him before.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.480]   He plays a 90.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.720]   It's like a Degera type.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.720]   It's amazing.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.360]   He's a 1920s immigrant and his computer coding great grandson.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.080]   Did I sell crimes in a van?
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.200]   Probably an American pickle that comes out August 6th.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.200]   I like the name.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.840]   Maybe the immigrant was a pickle maker.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.720]   I don't know.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.000]   Yeah, it's very confusing.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.200]   I kind of want to get it because it looks like, yeah, it's crazy.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.560]   It looks like there'll be good content on it, but I don't want to pay for it because I
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.440]   might have it for free and just not know it.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.640]   So I have to check my email.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   Is that what you're saying, Andy?
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   Because, yeah, I think I pay for it.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   AT&T is in the description.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.800]   Oh, what a mess.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.520]   What a mess.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:45.280]   Ridley Scott going to do a deal with Apple TV Plus.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.240]   It's a Scott free productions.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.960]   What they call a first look deal.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:56.360]   That means that anything Ridley produces, Apple gets to bid on it before anybody else does.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:02.880]   Because he can't sell the third aliens prequel.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.520]   According to Variety, Apple won Scott, Scott Free is the name of it, the company, the production
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   company.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:14.200]   One Scott Free's signature and what is described as a pretty competitive environment.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:18.240]   Apple is very getting freer and freer with a checkbook, right?
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.960]   Ridley Scott will develop global TV projects for Apple TV Plus with Ridley Scott, David
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.680]   Zucker, Clayton Kruger, and Jordan Sheehan acting as executive producers.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.440]   I don't know what it is.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:41.560]   Can I get a Snyder cut of Alien's Covenant?
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.680]   It's great that they're signing these deals, but let's see if they actually turn into any
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   movies and B and B.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.560]   Let's see if they turn into any really good movies.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.840]   The New Dune movie or the foundation series that Apple is still working on.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.080]   I have enough stuff coming that I actually want to see.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.800]   And Apple has a long relationship with Ridley Scott.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.640]   Don't forget he produced the 1984 commercial.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.080]   And today, Apple is in deals with studios A24.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:22.800]   I think that's the Amazon Studio Imagine documentaries, Sesame Workshop and Peanuts, Alfonso Cuaron,
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.720]   who did that amazing Netflix-only Roma movie, which I thought deserved best picture.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.800]   They're doing Fraggle Rock, Leo.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.120]   That buys them so many get out of jail free cars with me.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.360]   They've got a deal with Julia Louis Dreyfus, whose VEEP was probably the funniest sitcom
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:47.160]   of all time, at least one of them, Lee Eisenberg, Oprah Winfrey, of course.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:53.120]   There's a new show coming from the showrunner of Dickinson.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.520]   She signed a deal with him.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.800]   Maybe Apple's game plan is they're just trying to make themselves look attractive to Disney
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   for potential buyout.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.000]   I'm glad Alex Lindsey isn't here.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.920]   This is amazing.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.800]   So in Canada, for a few of Max's content, we have to pay $20 a month for the Crave movies
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.560]   plus HBO package.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.080]   We'll get one, two, three of the launch shows.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.240]   But additionally, sometime in the future, we might get six others.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.040]   What does HBO have against Canada?
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.040]   That's what I want to know.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.480]   Why don't they just make it like Netflix is international, Disney plus is international,
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.840]   Apple TV plus is international.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.400]   What is so hard about making an international service?
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.880]   CBS and HBO just want, oh no, it's worth more money if we totally fragment the market by
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   selling different rights to different shows in different geographies.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.720]   Let's do that instead.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.720]   And getting angry and angry as I read this.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.080]   We talked a lot about Apple's AR glasses last week.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.440]   That was a great conversation.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.400]   Not, you know, one of the things I think we said is nobody's talking about the Apple
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.120]   television set anymore or the Apple car.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.680]   John Louis Gesset has a Monday note on the Apple car.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.760]   He says, who wouldn't want a neat electric Apple car coming from the Apple Watch iPhone
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.120]   and Macintosh maker?
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.360]   It would be an automotive dream come true.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:15.320]   Unfortunately, reality refuses to cooperate.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.520]   Is that picture the Dyson car?
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   Do they just take that off the back?
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   It does.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   It looks like a Dyson truck.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.960]   It's a car with a proper amount of suction for sure.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.560]   Well, he showed it off for the first time, the car that he never made it looked very much
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.840]   like that.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.840]   Well, there's an organ Stanley analyst who talks about...
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   I don't know.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.840]   Is it Katie Huberty?
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.840]   Is it Katie Huberty?
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.520]   No, it's Adam Jonas who's known as a Tesla bull because he's never written anything bad
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.200]   about Elon Musk or Tesla.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.560]   That's quite a trick.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.120]   You must not have access to Twitter.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.800]   To strengthen the reference to Apple, Jonas ropes in his Morgan Stanley colleague, Katie
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   Huberty.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.440]   Oh, there we go.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.000]   Yeah, I think the problem with this is that it's not...
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.600]   There was a lot of really bad reporting.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.280]   It's like the iPhone wasn't originally an iPhone.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.480]   Apple bought finger works and had these giant tables trying to figure out what a multi-touch
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.480]   interface was and then Steve decided to make it a phone because he hated his phone and
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.680]   then it was productized and Titan was like, yes, there was various automation and automotive
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.880]   and all these imaging and ingestion stuff.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.640]   But Apple's ambitions were never...
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.920]   Like a car might have been a product spun out of Titan.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:37.600]   The way iPhone was a product spun out of purple, but that's not the sum total of those ambitions,
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.720]   which are still ongoing in the special projects.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.560]   Should we discount anything Katie Huberty says or...
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.880]   She wants to make money for her clients.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.800]   We believe Apple sees the car along with other markets like Health and Payments as a large
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.120]   market where Apple can contribute to a better solution.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.680]   We expect Apple, she writes, to spend nearly $19 billion in R&D this year on the car up
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.040]   more than $10 billion from just five years ago.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.040]   Awoment, though that's an all R&D, so it's meaningless.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.160]   This compares to the 80 to 100 billion total R&D spent for the entire auto industry.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.240]   I think they're asking the wrong questions.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.240]   What is an Apple car?
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.960]   Is it like a car that you buy and you put in your garage or is Apple Car a service where
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.520]   there's a fleet of Apple cars in every major city and you book time on it?
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:33.080]   Or is it an e-bike that issues traditional automotives for a very nicely designed bipedal
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.480]   vehicle that takes you?
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.880]   I think all of those are questions yet to be answered, but it may not be anything like
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.840]   what we think of as a traditional car at this point, because those may not be as long for
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   the...
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.960]   I think that's not probably the growth industry where those vehicles are going.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.800]   Because sake concludes, if Apple has a secret weapon, we must again ask, where are the
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.800]   rumors?
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:59.920]   The magical Apple car is an attractive fantasy, but I think he thinks it's kind of a fantasy.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:07.560]   I don't believe anything that I ever hear about the Apple car becoming an actual product.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:13.400]   We often talk about the degrees of faith in Apple rumors with the very, very top being,
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:17.560]   "Okay, it's just two weeks before the launch, or these proposed launch of the iPhone.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:21.760]   Okay, at this point, if I see case designs, if I see box designs, I'm willing to do this
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.720]   and to believe that this is true."
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.320]   But when you talk about something that is really looks like it's just a platform for
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.520]   now, a way of investigating a whole bunch of technologies that could feed into a lot
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.840]   of different things that Apple is doing in services and consumer products, and nothing
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.720]   to do with transportation at all.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.320]   Again, we can speculate all we want.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.640]   We can try to create as many think pieces as we want.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:51.280]   But for now, I don't believe anything that says that it's a real product as opposed to
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280]   a research project.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.080]   Like the LiDAR camera, it probably came from a lot of the people on those teams because
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.640]   that's the technology of environment ingestion that you need for all the AR projects and
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.320]   all the automotive projects.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.800]   That's the kind of technology that comes out of those things, which is kind of cool.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.480]   Laura, you read all those stories.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.680]   Anything else that seems important to mention that I've left?
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.840]   You know, actually, on, let's see.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.120]   My days are so mixed up.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.400]   Now, Wednesday, I think it was, was Global Accessibility Awareness Day and this month
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.000]   is Accessibility Awareness Month.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.200]   So, I think it's probably a good thing to mention that which from the Apple's perspective,
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.960]   if you're kind of taking things like that into consideration, Apple has always been at
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:45.880]   the forefront of making features accessible in their technology.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.560]   And I've always been really impressed with how every new operating system that comes
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.680]   out takes into consideration how this affects the accessibility community and they make sure
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.960]   that if there are changes that they're made very aware, I've been reading quite a few
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.040]   articles and watching videos and things like that about the different things that Apple
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.000]   does with accessibility.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.280]   Their learning resource center now has videos up that will have someone in the ALS community
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:20.080]   doing sign language while telling you how to do something like use clips on your phone
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   or something like that.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.320]   And these are little ways in which Apple is reminding us all how important accessibility
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   is to them.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.320]   So, there's that.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.400]   They made for Accessibility Day.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:36.720]   They made a playlist, long playlist with 21 videos on how to add accessibility features
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.400]   to your phone or how to use accessibility features.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   I think this is great.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:47.360]   This is all on YouTube, how to use Reader View and Speak Screen and Safari and so forth.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:53.200]   Of course, it depends on your disability, but this is a really useful thing to have these.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.960]   There's also an entire section of the Apple website devoted to accessibility.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.880]   It's apple.com/accessibility with lots of interesting stuff in here.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.640]   So yeah, I think Apple has absolutely been a leader in all of this.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.040]   And every time I talk to blind listeners, we have a lot of blind listeners on the radio
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.480]   show, they universally say the iPhone is really nailed.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.560]   It's the best of the breed and it's definitely the one to use.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.720]   So yeah, good on Apple.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.040]   In fact, we had a couple of people visit in the studio back when we had visitors in the
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.640]   studio who worked on Apple's Accessibility team.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.880]   Aren't they amazing?
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.240]   Yeah, they're just great.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.960]   And one was a blind guy who had worked in retail.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.680]   Apple said, "You.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   Come here.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.240]   We want you to work and help make sure that our stuff works for people with low and no
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240]   vision."
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.040]   I mean, it's just this is the way to do it.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.000]   Even Apple PR for accessibility is someone from the accessibility community.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.520]   The thing that blew my mind when I started doing this four years ago, I had to talk with
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.480]   them and they're like, "We made the camera accessible.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.720]   What are you talking about?"
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.960]   They're like, "Yeah, you know, blind people want to take selfies.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.120]   Maybe they can't see them, but they send them to their family and friends."
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.360]   So the camera will say, "Face not in focus.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360]   Face too dark.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.360]   Turn.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.360]   Do this."
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.240]   Because of course they should have that.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240]   That's so awesome.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240]   I just go team.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240]   That's so awesome.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.520]   They do that on Android's camera too.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.400]   The amount of work that's being done is, and the fact that it used to be taught, it used
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.480]   to be, you got the impression that this is something that they're doing in addition to
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.680]   all the other work that they're doing.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:34.560]   And now someone who is a much better reporter on Accessibility than I am would be able to
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.760]   speak more clearly about this.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:42.120]   But I do get the impression that it's just like the camera features, just like the build
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.680]   features, just like the cellular chips.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.600]   This is a tier one feature.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:53.360]   This is a tier one responsibility of the engineering team on both the Google team and the Apple
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   team.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   Here's a...
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.960]   I really like to hear that about the Google team.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.400]   Andy, I think it was a few years ago that I was at Google I/O and talking with some
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.920]   accessibility people who were saying that they prefer the Android operating system, but because
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:12.520]   of their needs, they were using iPhone because it actually, that's the only thing that was
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.840]   really working for them.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.840]   So to hear that Google finally kind of decided, "Okay, we are going to make this a tier one,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.280]   as you say, responsibility to make sure that it's not after we make the feature that we
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.640]   decide whether or not we can make it accessible, but we're not going to make the feature unless
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.000]   we can also make it accessible."
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.520]   I like to hear that they're expanding on that more.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.640]   They have a dedicated accessibility team.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.440]   Here's that video you mentioned from today at Apple.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.960]   This is Gus S. just teaching you how to use clips and ASL.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   Apple Carnegie.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.760]   They have a huge amount of ASL people at Apple Carnegie because it's down the street from
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.000]   the American Hearing Institute.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   That's so great.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.280]   I just think this is just fantastic, man.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   This is also...
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.120]   This kind of video is...
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.200]   It has audio to it.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   It has a narrator to it.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   I turned on voiceover for accessibility for non-deaf people, which is amazing.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.200]   I love that.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.800]   Yeah, so what I love about it is that it brings us all together.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.600]   It reminds us that there are people in the community that use sign language to learn,
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.600]   but that it also, just using voiceover is another way to make that work for us, so that we're
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.760]   all together in it.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:26.080]   This video I actually thought was really just a great mix for all of us.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080]   It's just fantastic.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.800]   ASL, when you watch somebody who's fluent in it, which Gus is a beautiful language, it's
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.600]   just really fun to watch.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.160]   They have accents.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.920]   It's endlessly amazing, Tiller.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.560]   I just wanted to add Microsoft, too.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.360]   They've done things like the accessibility controller for Xbox, and it's great to see
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   all the companies.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.680]   I've always wanted them to be as competitive with accessibility as they have with cameras.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.200]   Get up on stage and say what you're doing to raise the bar as much as you talk about
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.080]   camera technology or this cool algorithm thing, make accessibility, high-order competitive
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.920]   bit, and it looks like they're all doing that now, which is just amazing.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.800]   So, Laurie, I'm really glad you brought that up.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   That's great.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:03.800]   Thank you.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:04.800]   Why do we need this?
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.800]   But we all need it.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.080]   Sometimes you go to the doctor and your pupils are dilated or you fall and hurt your leg
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.480]   or fall and hurt your wrist.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   As we get older, our vision changes, our hearing changes, and it really is about everyone.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.960]   A lot of the amazing features we have, even every day on our devices now, come from accessibility
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.520]   teams making accessibility features that were then realized they could make interface better
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520]   for everybody.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.800]   So, it's a win, total win-win.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:33.560]   But also, what needs to be pointed out, I'll admit that I had an area of ignorance regarding
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:36.200]   accessibility in the world thinking that, "Oh, yeah.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.120]   I think it's a good idea to have curb cutouts.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.040]   It's a good idea to make sure that subway stations are accessible to everybody," which
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:51.560]   sounds like it's a good way of thinking, but I had not made that leap until, "No, no,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.960]   no, it's not that it's good to have these things.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:01.240]   These things have to be there because you can't shut out the world."
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:08.880]   People with disabilities are absolutely 100% entitled to all of the same things that everybody
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.400]   else gets to do in this world.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.560]   And so, it's not there.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.840]   I suppose that if we can modify this restaurant layout so that it can accommodate people who
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.720]   need assistive mobility devices, no, you have to do that.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:29.640]   And I'm glad to see Apple and Google again change their attitude for, "Isn't it nice
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640]   that we're doing this?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.320]   Isn't that nice that we pay so much attention?"
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:38.200]   And their attitude is that it seems to be, again, someone who is more active or journalism
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.040]   in this field will is a better person to talk.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.200]   But it's like, "No, no, no, we have to do this.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.000]   We are obligated to do this.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:52.680]   We don't have the choice of making a device that can be used by some people but not by
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.680]   others."
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.520]   And Andy, don't ever feel like you have to wait for somebody with more expertise to
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.040]   be the one to talk about this.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.360]   We should all be talking about it.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.800]   I don't know anything about accessibility needs, but I know we need more.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.560]   And I think it's great for us to champion it.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.720]   Whether or not we know what it means or how to do it, we should always be fighting for
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:17.920]   that and be reminding all of our corporations and leaders that they need to be doing that
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.920]   too.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:19.920]   And we just need change, right?
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.840]   Steve, we have a clean-o and all those wonderful things.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   No, exactly.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.160]   That's why it's especially Steve.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.000]   I love the work that he's doing.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   I love the...
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.960]   I just love all of that.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:38.480]   I just need to acknowledge that part of the problem is that you have people who don't
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.120]   deal with these things day to day to day.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:46.720]   Members of that community should be the voice to talk about it as opposed to people like
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:52.320]   me talking for a community that I'm not a part of.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.200]   So thank you, Lori, for bringing that up.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.200]   Very important.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.200]   Good.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.200]   Excellent points.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.160]   And boy, Apple really knocked it out of the park.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   That's fantastic.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.960]   Our picks of the week, starting with you, Lori.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.720]   Gile, I buy everything you talk about.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.720]   So make it good.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.960]   Well, yeah, this one is going to be an expensive pick.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.600]   So over the weekend, it was the Memorial Day weekend, you know, a couple of extra days.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.000]   It's a grilling weekend.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.520]   I got a Traeger Wi-Fi...
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.320]   So jealous.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.440]   ... pro 780 pellet grill.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.640]   And it is amazing.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   OK, here's the thing.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.040]   Like, I'm not even...
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.680]   I absolutely hands down love this one.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.200]   They have a smaller version that's a little less expensive, but this is why I love it
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.200]   so much.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:47.280]   We put some ribs on the grill at two o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.240]   I went grocery shopping.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.680]   I took a nap.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.760]   All I had to do was go out and check to make sure that the pellets were still in the container
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.520]   because everything, the temperature in the grill was already on my phone.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:07.080]   I knew that the heat was at the right level and it automatically...
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:14.360]   It's amazing how much smoking it becomes a wonderful experience when you're not down
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.520]   there, you know, shoveling the fire yourself to try to keep it going.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:24.040]   And Laurie, if you had just purchased the $49.99 Traeger pellet sensor, you wouldn't even
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.680]   have to check the pellets.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.680]   Exactly.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   The life fire sounds awesome.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.960]   That's my next investment for sure.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.360]   I'm buying this now.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.160]   Our big green egg is on its last legs and we need a new grill.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.960]   You have to experience the smoking of it.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:49.800]   So I have a smoker that you have to feed with the wood chips.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:54.800]   I never use it because it's so time consuming.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.560]   But with this electric...
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.120]   It's an electric smoker.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.160]   You just throw your meat on and you check your app to make sure that it's working.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.680]   Do you have to put...
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.640]   You use pellets instead.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.040]   The pellets replace it.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.080]   Do they have smoking pellets like hickory pellets?
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.080]   Yes.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.080]   They do.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.080]   They have a flavor of pellets like mesquite and hickory.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.040]   Those are two examples of apple wood.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.680]   And you feed it through and what happens is depending on the temperature that you want
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.520]   to heat to, you get more or less of the actual smoke inside the grill.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.760]   So if you want it to be very smokey, if you want it to really have a strong smoke flavor,
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.720]   you smoke it at 182, 220 or something like that.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:43.680]   If you want your meat to be less smokey but still have the slow cook experience, you would
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.480]   take it up a notch to maybe 250 or something like that.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.600]   It's so amazing.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.520]   I am never going back to using a wood chip smoker because the set it and forget it is
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.960]   so fantastic.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:02.320]   The food difference, the difference in taste, because using wood chips and real flames,
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.440]   it's obviously going to have a better flavor to it.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.200]   But it's negligible.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:12.560]   And the flavoring of the meat that came out from the trigger grill was so good.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.560]   I...
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.840]   Oh, everybody should do this.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.560]   It's amazing.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.320]   I really loved it.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.040]   I really love my big green egg, but it's a lot of work.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.600]   I got to go out and buy lump charcoal.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.200]   I got to set it all up.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.040]   You wanted to be green egg-y with small slices.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.200]   You have to babysit it.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.200]   You have to babysit it.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.760]   That's the heart.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.000]   The iPhone tells you when it's done.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.040]   Yes, it tells you as...
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.400]   You can keep track of the temperature to make sure that's always smoking at the temperature.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.920]   You want it to be.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.760]   You can set a timer from inside your house.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.720]   You can turn it on and preheat it.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.400]   From inside the house, go smoke your meats, come back inside the house for four hours
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.400]   if you want to.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.120]   And just check your phone to make sure that everything is maintaining its appropriate
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.360]   speed and everything.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.520]   And then go back out when it's done and never have had to open the grill once if you don't
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.520]   want to.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.520]   Oh my God.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   The iPhone doesn't eat your ribs then, does it?
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.800]   Like, it's not like I did all the work.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.800]   I deserve all the food.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.800]   It's not like...
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.600]   Right, exactly.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.600]   And the iPhone also won't wash the dishes when it's done either.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.000]   Ah, okay, that's very good.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.600]   Well, I like this.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.600]   I just...
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600]   I'm buying it, by the way.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.280]   You knew it, Leo.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.280]   You predicted this.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.280]   I knew I would.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.000]   Oh man, this looks so good.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   It's expensive.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   It's a thousand bucks.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000]   It's not a cheaper one.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.120]   But it's going to last me a lifetime, right?
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.560]   Yeah, and it really is really good.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.160]   It works really well.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.160]   I was really impressed.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.120]   We did multiple cooks because I wanted to test all the features out.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.000]   I slow-cooked vegetables on it.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.240]   I grilled hamburgers on it.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:53.600]   So making sure that you still get kind of the same grilling needs out of the way.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.520]   And did the smoking of the meats.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.520]   In all three of those different experiences all turned out really good.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.040]   The meat was fantastic.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.360]   The vegetables were nice and soft and not overcooked.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.360]   Don't want to be worried.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.640]   What would you make?
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.960]   I made the pork ribs and regular old hamburgers.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.680]   And then the vegetable mix was a medley of potatoes and onions and peppers and things
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   like that.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   Bobbikkiu.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680]   Bobbikkiu.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.800]   Okay, Andy, you talk while I buy this grill.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:30.400]   Well, this one is free because all the money is being spent by taxpayers.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.480]   Tomorrow is Tuesday as we record Wednesday is going to be the launch of demo to SpaceX.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.520]   Yes, everybody's excited about that.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.800]   First crude, crude US trip to the space since the end of the shuttle program.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:51.080]   The first brand new spacecraft in 1981.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:57.400]   I just was reading some statistics that there have only been nine launches of brand new spaceships
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400]   in human history.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.880]   This is the fifth that the Americans have put up.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:06.000]   And it's going to be, it really is going to be a whoop to do.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.520]   And so I'm going to be glued to, I've decided I'm going to have two screens going.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.000]   NASA TV is usually what I'm watching launches on.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.320]   I'm also going to have the science channels live coverage up.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:26.400]   I think they're streaming it at science.com or science in discovery channel.com.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.040]   They seem to have a really good team of color commentators going.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:36.120]   Four astronauts, another ISS astronaut that's actually in orbit.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.280]   They've got, I was attracted to the idea of Adam Savage from Mythbusters.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   I was a little bit put off by the fact that Katy Perry apparently is going to be part
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.360]   of this at some point, but it is like three hours of coverage.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.640]   So even if they have her do a music, that should be part of that.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640]   It's okay.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640]   That's fine.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.400]   It's going to be fine.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.040]   But I really think it's going to be an exciting thing to see.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.520]   I love the fact that I'm so befuddled by so much of this.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:16.600]   I'm kind of fixated on the pressure suits because they famous, of course, it was Elon Musk
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:17.600]   Company.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.440]   So they hired the company that coincidentally enough designed movie spacesuits, including
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440]   the spacesuits for Prometheus.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:32.200]   But the thing is the fake Prometheus spacesuits look more realistic than the real pressure
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.200]   suits.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.800]   This is the first because I realize there's like there's an American patch.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.480]   There is a crew members name is like on the shoulder, but the front is totally blank.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.320]   They don't even have an emission patch on it.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:52.520]   And I have to remind myself that Andy, these are fully functional actual protective garments.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.760]   And you're complaining they don't look as nice as the fake ones that do nothing to save
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.400]   anybody's life.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.200]   So I'm just reminding people that it's going to be really, really cool.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.680]   I feel as though this is going to be the sort of thing that you remember and we're glad
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:12.560]   to have watched live, including all of the awkward moments, including all the awkward
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.680]   pauses during delays, including all the moments when they realize that, ooh, we really thought
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.400]   we're going to fill like two and a half to three hours with this because that's one of
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.760]   the reasons why I love NASA TV because it's not, I'm not going to watch the SpaceX feed
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.040]   because I know they've planned this out way too much.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.680]   And they're going to say, and now here's a special motivational, motivational video of,
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:41.000]   you know, when the eagle sometimes breaks its wing and has to spend, oh, for God's sake,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.920]   what's on what's on YouTube right now?
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.080]   But yeah, I'm definitely not only going to be watching it, but I'm going to be capturing
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.200]   it so that I can watch it later.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.240]   I only have one question.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.560]   Where do I get wood pellets?
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.360]   You know, I found them.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.360]   I found them.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   We have people here.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.440]   You're looking at the surely bonds of earth and catching the fan of God and you want to
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.440]   know about that.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440]   We liked it.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.640]   Yeah, but can you smoke meats on the moon?
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.840]   No, there's no gravity.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.000]   Well, we're never going to find out unless we get commercial space launchers back up and
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000]   running.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.920]   I am just teasing you and I am just as excited as you are.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.720]   That's all I know I'm being teased.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.640]   Believe me, I spent enough time in junior high to know what I'm being.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.760]   I will be watching with everyone else.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.760]   I hear the tears coming from the back.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.600]   And if Katy Perry sings, I flew to the moon and I liked it.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.480]   Yeah, I'm telling you, yeah, Rocket Man, she could do Rocket Man.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.480]   All right.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.480]   That's fine.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.440]   I'm going to enjoy all of three hours.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   That's awesome.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.280]   I just wish we were any Linux.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   That's all.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.760]   Yeah, I should have some smoke meats while I'm watching.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.120]   Don't think about the real.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.720]   I literally ordered that.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   I literally the minute you told me.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   Well, sorry.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.720]   We can't help you.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.720]   We've harmed you a lot, especially in the summer.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.520]   Lisa is always saying, "Oh, Leo, can you fire up the grill?"
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.720]   I'm going to get all smoky and smelly and I'm going to do the coals.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:15.480]   I've gone through, I go through these chimney starters, like one every month or two because
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:20.720]   the fire gets hot and they melt, they're going to slam you at the bottom of the grill.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.720]   I think you've talked me into it.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.760]   As long as it gives me that smoky flavor and it sounds like this.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.760]   You know it will give you that smoky flavor.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.560]   And by the way, Jammer B's sister has one of these and Jammer B's jumping up and down.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:37.600]   He's coming over for a social distancing barbecue the minute this arrives.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   Okay.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.600]   Oh, that's great.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.600]   Louisiana hot links all around.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   It's the long ribs.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.600]   It's the long ribs, not the short ribs.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.680]   It's going to get some brisket.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.480]   Smoker, right?
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.200]   You can grill, but it's a smoker.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200]   I'm so excited.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.000]   I know it's terrible for you though, right?
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   It's carcinogenic.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.200]   It's going to kill me, but I don't care because I go happy.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:03.280]   I mean, if you don't eat it every day, nothing, nothing you eat during quarantine is a new
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.920]   Italian problem.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.240]   No one gains weight during quarantine.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.560]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.880]   So I thought I was going high, but Lori Gill, she just spiked the ball.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:21.400]   So if you woke up on the internet today, then you woke up to the news that Sony had released
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.400]   a new vloggers camera.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.400]   Oh, shoot.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.400]   I'm in trouble.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.800]   I can't find a few things in one show.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.600]   There were videos from just about every one of the people that we all know and adore.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.240]   And it's got a lot of the features that people have been waiting for in a Sony camera,
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.280]   and any blogging camera for years now, including a flip around screen, which is something that,
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.440]   you know, Sony had been hesitant to do, but it's light.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.560]   It's, you know, it goes for a while.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.960]   It has a few like, I wouldn't call them deal breakers, but a few flaws, like it only goes
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.680]   to 4k 30.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.800]   So you can't do 4k 60 and then slow it down.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.720]   It also has micro USB on it.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.480]   Like we're still in the 70s, but those things aside, you, it's got like a little dead cat
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]   you can put on the microphone.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.480]   It's so cute.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:13.120]   It's got an optional blogger handle that you can put on it to, to carry it around with.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.920]   It can also become a tripod and is a remote control.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.920]   It's really small.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920]   It is a fixed lens.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:25.720]   It starts off at, I think, F1.8, but it rapidly goes to F1.8 when you start, you know, zooming
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.520]   in at all on anything, but still it's, Sony's got really good image science, really good
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.520]   color science.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.360]   It's got a button on it that will change the focal depth so you'll get, it's like a
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.280]   bokeh button, but not computational.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.760]   It's like, okay, you want to see everybody?
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.240]   Okay, you want the background blur so that if you're not really adept at cameras, it'll
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.880]   do it for you.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:48.160]   You can reprogram that if you are adept at cameras and you don't want to waste a button
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.480]   on that, which is really nice.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.960]   The picture quality looks really, really good.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.600]   I forget the name HGL.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:00.560]   It can shoot in the profile that gives you the higher dynamic range and it's just, it's
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.640]   700 bucks plus, you know, extra if you want the, if you want the, the vlogger grip, but
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.160]   if you're just starting out or you want an extra camera or a B cam or one day, again,
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:14.360]   a travel cam that you can go out with, it does have beauty modes for people like me who,
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.600]   you know, don't look as fresh as we, as we used to.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:22.240]   So you can, you can have zero light medium or heavy beautification on it.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.960]   It's got a bunch of different color profiles.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.400]   So it, there's always seems like every camera has a one flaw that you can't really tell
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.880]   why they did it, but you know, this, this is really well around it.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.080]   And I think it's a great camera for anybody who wants to be in, who wants to get in on
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.040]   sort of not the tiktokie video.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.480]   That's your phone is still better for that, but anyone who wants to get into the vlogger,
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.480]   the vlogger life.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.720]   ZV one, the vlog camera, the sunny ZV or ZV one.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.880]   So the grip is a, is it looks like the grip is also, it's a gimbal.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:55.880]   Is that right?
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.120]   Or no, it's not a gimbal.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.120]   It will be a tripod.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.720]   It's Bluetooth, but you have to actually hold it.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.880]   Like I don't believe it does any.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.880]   There's no robotic.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:03.680]   They have some steady, steady features.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.840]   They have image stabilization on the camera.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:07.840]   Okay.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.840]   Wow.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.840]   And the focus is instant.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.560]   Like they have, they have like an unboxing mode where you can go from like, here's, here's
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.560]   the phone.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.560]   Here's me.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.560]   Here's the phone.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.560]   And it just instantly sharpens.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.720]   It's, it's, it's, it focuses on it.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.600]   It's really just shows you how big this category is that Sony would make a camera just for
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   vloggers.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.040]   Well, just, just the fact that it's an unboxing mode.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040]   Okay.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:36.440]   I'm, I'm glad that people who need this feature have this feature.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.600]   I weep that this feature is big enough.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.200]   I think they call it showcase mode.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.200]   I don't think they call it.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.040]   Everyone who did a video on it immediately called it unboxing mode.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.040]   That's hysterical.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:51.160]   Well, you know, I'm not going to buy this one because I already have a lot of equipment.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:56.160]   We're all waiting for the, for the Canon R5, our US R5.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.160]   Very, very wireless.
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160]   So this will.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.120]   So it's $750.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.060]   Is it a, it's a must be a one inch sensor.
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.280]   Is it, is it, it's like the RX100?
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.280]   Yes.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.280]   Almost.
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.480]   And the RX100 is that, is more expensive, I think.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.480]   So that's pretty cool with those features.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.840]   It's built a vlog, Leo.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.000]   It's built a vlog.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.320]   Just like you, Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.960]   Yes, YouTube's Renee Richie.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:29.720]   I'm going to just do a quick pick just because they deserve a little credit.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:36.720]   And then, the final error is back baby and file maker 19 just came out the biggest update
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.720]   in 15 years.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   Yes.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.440]   This file maker has been around forever.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.080]   I've done a lot of file maker apps.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.400]   It really is.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.400]   You know what?
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.800]   I'm glad they're updating it because it's a great low code solution.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.820]   It's been around forever, three decades now.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.240]   You can even now use JavaScript.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.960]   They've got a bunch of new add-ons.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960]   It supports Siri shortcuts.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.120]   What?
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.240]   And Apple's Core ML.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:06.440]   You can use NFC to read tags.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:09.760]   This is a pretty amazing thing.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.360]   And for me, the kind of the thing that put me over the top is you can host your apps
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:16.680]   on Linux, which is a great place to.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:22.800]   I've always wanted to redo our sales app, which was written in a fairly janky fashion
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.080]   and breaks all the time.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:27.280]   And I always thought this would be the way to do it as a file maker.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.240]   And if we could host it on Linux, have our clients all over, that would be really great.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.040]   So Claris, they're back.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:41.200]   File maker 19 just came out the biggest update in 15 years.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.480]   And the way they do this, much like Adobe, you don't buy it outright.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.360]   You subscribe per user per month.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.280]   But I think it's well worth it if you're a business and you need some.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.680]   It's kind of like a, I don't know, it's a database that's focused on presentation.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.280]   Is that a good way to put it?
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.600]   I really love file maker.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.840]   So I'm glad to see it's around.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.800]   Well, we have completed our assignment for today, which is to entertain the troops for
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:10.480]   one hour, 46 minutes and 15 seconds.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.160]   So I thank you.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.520]   You know, when I saw that Joe Rogan got sold to Spotify or went exclusive to Spotify for
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.440]   the guests is $100 million.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.360]   And I saw that his shows are often longer than three hours.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   It vindicated me.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.760]   It made me feel like, oh, I guess our shows aren't that long.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.560]   They're not that bad.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.960]   And he only talks to one person the whole time.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:33.960]   So come on.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960]   That was one show.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.960]   He's lazy.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960]   He's lazy.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.840]   Although you guys almost 2000 Joe Rogan experiences in the can.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.160]   So congratulations, Joe.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160]   Wow.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.440]   That success is really great.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.480]   Thank you, Lori Gill.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.280]   She's the executive, I'm sorry, managing editor at I.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.640]   You could make me an executive.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.640]   She's an executive at imore.com.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.640]   She's a founder of the company.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.640]   She's a founder of the company, and she's a founder of the company.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.400]   She's a founder of the company, and she's a founder of the company.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.400]   And she's a founder of the company.
