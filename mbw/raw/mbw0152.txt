[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   With me today in studio, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Hello.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Pixelcore.com and Pixelcore.tv.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Thank you, Alex, for being here.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Vaya Skype from across the continent, Mr. Andy and Notco of the Chicago
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Just the three of us today, Scott Bourne has recused himself
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   for the next few weeks.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   He's become very busy, you know, with his photography.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   He's a busy guy.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   He's a busy, busy, busy guy.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   He's always a busy guy.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He also says, I don't think he's recused himself.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   He makes himself homeless though.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He met one of the people, one of the panelists in the lobby of the hotel earlier,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   so he cannot be guessing what our mystery guest line is.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I have a pre-existing relationship.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Recused is not the right word then.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Excused.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   How about excused?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Reverses X.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I had complained, I had complained, but then again, you're talking to the guy who missed
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   three in a row, so.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We had to turn over all the cards for Andy and Notco.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So the big story of the week, and we talked a lot about it on Twitch, is Apple rejecting
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   the Google Voice application.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.200]   There'll be some repercussions, Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, has resigned from the Apple
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   board.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   Do we think that that's all connected?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.720]   Well, of course, the FTC was investigating, what do they call it, crossing the beams?
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.000]   Crossing directorships or something like that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Direct directors.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Directorates.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And there still is.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.760]   There is still somebody on the Apple board who's on the Google board.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   For now.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   For now.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   He's going to have to choose.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   But I don't think that's why Eric resigned.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.360]   I think Eric resigned because of this Google Voice thing.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.280]   And the heating up battle, the FCC, sent a letter to Google, AT&T, and Apple saying,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.720]   "We want to know what's going on."
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.360]   Yeah, what's the deal?
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120]   So what is the deal?
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   Why does Apple reject the Google Voice application?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.280]   Well, I think that technically, they also pulled a third party GV application.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   Right.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.800]   And I think that technically, Apple has done this before.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   Anything that, or many applications that overlap what the core functions of the phone
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.520]   are have been removed.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   This isn't something that's new.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   But it's the first time they've done it.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   That's always so big as Google.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.160]   And I have to admit, this is the first one where I've gone, "Oh my gosh."
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.880]   We had one of the guys in the office got it before it was pulled down.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.680]   And the third party Google Voice went in, "It's awesome."
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   Is it?
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   Yeah, I wish I'd bought it.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.080]   Yeah, I wish I had two.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   So there's two of them.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   There's a third party app.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   And by the way, the guy, the developers being told, "You're responsible for any refunds."
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.200]   Yeah, that wasn't...
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   That's cool, man.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.520]   See, not only that, not only is he responsible for any refunds, but he's responsible for
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.360]   100% of the refunds.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   So Apple gets...
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   He only got 70%.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah, so Apple gets to keep their 30% cut, but he has to...
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   He's going to be like deeply 30% in the hole.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   Actually, I'm sorry, 50% in the hole almost for every sale.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   Sucks.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.920]   Apple's got to fix that.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.720]   I mean, of all the things that they're doing, they have to make that right.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.640]   I mean, to pull something off and then require someone to pay it back, plus the 30% that
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.600]   they took after they allowed it to be in the store for...
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   I love this in the store.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   I think two or three months.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.320]   So they allowed it to be in the store, then they pulled it out.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   I mean, that's...
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   Can you explain to me why the Skype app is okay and the Google Voice app is not okay?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I believe it's because the Skype...
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   The Skype app is only Wi-Fi.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Why is it?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I only.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Was the Google App 3G as well?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Actually...
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   No, you know the Google App.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Let me tell you.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.440]   I'm not sure, but I believe the Google App works as Google Voice does.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.880]   It's a good app by an incoming call.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.520]   You use phone minutes to use the Google App.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.560]   So you can place a free long-distance call, but you are using phone minutes or cheap long-distance
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   call.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   But it also...
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   I was just going to say, I think the distinction is that we're as Skype as an application that
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.840]   you use as an alternative means of communication.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.720]   The Google App is essentially you're taking the phone features out of your AT&T phone
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.200]   and replacing them with Google phone features, so to speak.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.880]   It's such a natural way of using your phone and placing and receiving phone calls that
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.280]   I think that that's what triggered the, "Okay, time to go into Death Star mode.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   Let's just shut them down."
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.040]   Well, and one of the things that was a big deal in our office, our office is like a
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.120]   fair day cage.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   And so most of our iPhones do not work more than 10 feet from the windows and your Wi-Fi
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   does.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   But the Wi-Fi does.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.360]   And one of the things, especially with text messaging, he was getting the text messaging
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   straight in and out of the office without any trouble once.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.120]   And we're a very SMS-centric company.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   And so it was very easy for him to work in the office.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   And that's one of my big problems.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.120]   I get into some of the studios there and I can't use my SMS.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   Free SMS.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.680]   Maybe that's part of the problem, although there are other free SMS applications.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   But I think the fact that it's so seamless, I think, is the real issue that I think.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I think it's more of an AT&T thing than an Apple thing.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   Well, and then of course the question the FCC really wants answered is did AT&T collude
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   with Apple on this?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   And AT&T says, "No, we didn't ask."
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   What did you tell them?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   We didn't say anything.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.000]   All we did was point that page 48, section three, sub clause three of our contract.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.840]   If that's saying something to them, I don't know.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   I don't know.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.320]   We didn't actually open our mouth.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.360]   We simply forwarded that little section to them.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   You know?
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.680]   Just say, "Rrrr!"
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.160]   Just one word, section four, three, three.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   Yes.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.120]   An answered counselor move on.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.080]   In some ways I think the FCC could, it would be to Apple's advantage to have the FCC apply
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.440]   pressure to force this back in because I think if any, I still think it's an, I think it's
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.520]   an AT&T thing, not an Apple thing.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.880]   And I think that the FCC pressing on them may force it back in, which I think is to Apple's
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   advantage.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   You think Apple wants this?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.560]   I don't think they necessarily want it, but I don't think it's necessarily bad for them.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.720]   I think when the turning points of the iPhone's development is going to be when Apple enters
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.920]   an agreement with Verizon or some other carrier, that's when Apple will have the opportunity
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.840]   to not announce something, but simply prove by action that no, almost every time we pull
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.800]   the total move on our developers was us having to honor terms of an AT&T contract that we
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.560]   really came to regret.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Really?
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.120]   I don't think it's as Apple.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.600]   The Death Star's AT&T and Apple's the good guy here.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.240]   No, I don't think they're the good guy.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   I think that a good guy indicates that they actively care about the user and they want
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.760]   to do the right thing.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.960]   There's a difference between that and simply not caring.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.360]   I don't care.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.160]   If our users want to make phone calls without the carrier, we don't care.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   Please don't.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.000]   We have so much to do during the day.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.360]   Why is this even coming to my desk?
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.160]   I think it's screaming these calls.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.040]   I think it's increasingly and supremely annoying to Apple that they have to start, they have
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.120]   to keep dealing with these customer service issues.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.760]   I do think that there's going to be a total overhaul of how applications are reviewed
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   and disavowed from a Russian out of the App Store.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.320]   It's not going to be because, well, we've decided that we're not doing right by our
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   consumers.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.800]   It's just that it's becoming way too much of a headache to keep screening these apps
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.520]   the way they're doing it right now and also of dealing with the backlash when somebody
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.200]   realizes that, hey, I just put $12,000 into this application and not only am I not going
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.520]   to recover any of that money, but I have to hand back the $1,000 that I made off of those
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.120]   few sales that I was able to make in the two days that it was available.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.880]   It is starting to be a huge headache for Apple, but they make money on this.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.640]   Presumably, it's, well, this is the old debate we had about iTunes too.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.680]   Is this profitable or is it just a way of selling iPhones for Apple?
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.320]   Well, I think it's about iPhones for Apple.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.480]   I think they're in their core, Apple is still a hardware company that is empowered by
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   software.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   They've got to stop thinking that way, don't you think?
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   I don't think so.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   It's done.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   We're pretty well for them.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.200]   In fact, I would say that they should go further down that path.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.640]   I mean, I think that we saw a little bit of that with a new final cut update.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   One of the things we didn't cover last week was the upgrade price, which was only $2.99
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.480]   for the, you know, for that lower than usual?
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.400]   Normally, you would see a six, like a software only company would do an upgrade of, you know,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.520]   $6.99 or so, you know, $5.99.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.080]   I think that's about the upgrade for the CS4 production suite, which is not selling as
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   well as 20% off your target.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.640]   Maybe it's $2.99, yeah.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.720]   You know, but you know, Apple coming in at $2.99 is that's something you do when you're
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   a hardware company that is empowering your hardware sales with software.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.040]   You know, iMovie is something you do when you're a hardware company, you know, free, you know,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   iMovie garage band.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   I think it's a really small thing to do when you're a hardware company that isn't powered
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   by software.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   But as John C. Devorek famously said, many moons ago, I'd rather have Bill Gates wallet
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   than Steve Jobs wallet.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   Yeah, but I think that I still, I still strongly believe that that was largely a 1986 to 1996
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   problem.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   Well, that's, I guess kind of what I'm thinking is that being a hardware company is such a
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   2000.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.180]   No, no, no, I guess I strongly believe that Apple, you know, just started after Steve
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.240]   Jobs for all of his, you know, ups and downs after Steve Jobs left Apple or was forced out
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   of Apple.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.800]   I think Apple coasted on the trajectory that he had derived for them and almost coasted
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.000]   to a standstill until he came back in and literally just went right back to where he
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.520]   started with the iMac and started doing it again.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   So the thing, I think that trying to figure out whether windows would have been as successful
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.440]   as they, as they were, you know, they, in the most critical time of Apple's development,
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.360]   they didn't have, you know, anyone at the stick, in my opinion.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.440]   I mean, the guys that were after Steve Jobs were for the most part useless.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840]   You know, that's, that's pretty obvious.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.200]   Hair spindler and guillameal.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.800]   They're all useless.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.400]   John Scully is a list of characters.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.440]   They were just typical management that you can't run a, you can't run a company like
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   Apple with.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.520]   What about, did you see Christmas seen as a blog post on his blog, factory Joe.com?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.640]   Steve Jobs hates the App Store.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.160]   Now I know this is a little much, but, but there's a certain kind of clarity to this
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.000]   conspiracy theory, but, but, but here's the deal.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.240]   For the sake of argument, to make a point says Chris, let's say for a moment that Steve
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.360]   Jobs really did hate the App Store and everything it stands for.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.200]   What if deep in his gut, he'd realized he'd been wrong to give in to developer demand.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Let's not forget that when the iPhone first came out, there was no App Store you were
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   supposed to do.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.280]   A browser based applications.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.640]   What if his illness was caused by the guilty felt over what he'd wrought by launching the
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   App Store?
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.960]   What if every ounce of his gaunt figure yearned for the demise of the App Store?
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   What would he do?
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.360]   Well, he'd start by, says factory Joe capriciously and indiscriminately rejecting applications,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.880]   raising the ire of developers as well as famous rock stars far and wide.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.520]   Any label, any app that connected to third party servers of the web with the equivalent
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.320]   of an NC 17 rating cutting off anyone whose phone is locked down by parental controls?
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.840]   Parental controls block all of that.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.600]   To make matters even more interesting, he'd put the entire control of the rating system
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.800]   in the hand of monkeys and people's on the mechanical Turk.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   Then he'd go and produce a new hardware device in response to years of speculation and change
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.720]   up the form factor and screen real estate for apps, forcing developers to port their
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.920]   apps to this new resolution, resulting in even more headaches.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.000]   Oh, and the price of an app would be perpetually driven down towards zero as reuse trails off
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.120]   after mere days of use, while only a few breakthrough successes would make any money
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.320]   whatsoever.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   Back and to the left.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.320]   Back and to the left.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.040]   Once again, back and to the left.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.000]   So does that seem reasonable?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It's true that if you think of it this way, Apple has done everything possible to make
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.920]   the App Store a nightmare for not only for its customers, but for Apple itself.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   You just said it.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.600]   They'd love to get out of this business of picking apps.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.960]   I think that they know how important the App Store is.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.760]   The iPhone achieved much greater velocity after the App Store arrived than before when
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.200]   everything was web based.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.080]   I think they want to make so much sense for them to essentially outsource the rating and
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.000]   the operation of the App Store only because again, it's produced.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.040]   They want the money that it want the headaches.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.640]   Outsourcing that operation will give them what they want on both sides.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.280]   I think it's pretty obvious when you read the blog post that's more of a what if it's
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   more.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   It's a tongue and cheek.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   I understand.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   Exactly.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   It's funny.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.000]   It's like, you know, just like the Irish, probably, I think should not be eating their
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.160]   babies as the famous poet said.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.280]   Some people might freak out and think of it.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.600]   It's funny because there's some truth in it.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   It feels like it.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   But I think that, you know, I think Apple, I mean, I think we've seen what happens on
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   the other end of that when you don't have enough control with the Amazon, the Kindle
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   issue that happened that's turned into, you know, a lawsuit now.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.880]   Well, kind of late my homework, man.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   Well, but no, but I guess what I'd say though is that is that you, you know, Apple is still
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   trying to figure it out.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.960]   I think everyone's trying to figure out what the right method is, you know, to control
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.760]   your brand, you know, because there are, you know, and be able to get people the freedom
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   that they want.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.880]   Has Apple strayed too far in the side of control and fascism?
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.320]   For me, the Google one was the first one where I really went.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.480]   They really, yeah, they really, that was too far.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.680]   Andy, you think they've gone too far?
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.640]   I, again, I need to know exactly the reasons why they did it.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   I would be some.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   Well, what does that mean?
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   They will never tell you.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   What does that mean?
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.720]   I'm saying that I'm inclined or maybe a better word would be prejudiced to believe that anytime
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.120]   that there is an app that's been rejected that could be blamed on a network issue.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.320]   I think it, I think I really have to be open to the possibility that this is an AT&T contract
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.280]   issue as opposed to Apple just being jerks.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.680]   I mean, Apple was quote being jerks and quote for not allowing turn by turn directions and
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.240]   then turns out that, well, no, it's because they licensed certain, they licensed certain
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   map info.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.360]   Rather, their deal with Google says that they cannot use the map data that they're getting
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.200]   from Google for turn by turn.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.440]   Google can't Google.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.200]   I mean, for me, exactly right.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.520]   But so I mean, which, which, and then suddenly those blog posts is, oh, well, Apple doesn't
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.320]   want the Apple doesn't want the $9 application to compete with AT&T's $10 per month turn by
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   turn navigation service.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.080]   I know it turns out to be something very simple.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.240]   Now, again, I'll say it again, I think that Apple was not prepared for what it would take
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   for them to get an app store up and running.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.360]   I don't think that they foresaw that a simple guy making maybe five bucks over minimum wage
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.880]   or simply clicks a yes or a no button on every application that comes in, that that could
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.800]   have incredible repercussions a week or two weeks after he clicks that button.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.040]   And again, I would be very, very shocked if this time next year there was not some other
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.360]   sort of system in place.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.120]   Either again, some sort of outsourced ranking system or some sort of set into stone written
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.000]   down on actual paper in ink, black and white.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.040]   Here are the reasons why we will approve your app.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.360]   Here are reasons why we will not approve.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.720]   We will not approve your app.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.400]   And if we ever, and though we reserved the right to turn down your app for any reason,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.880]   if we use a reason that is not on this piece of paper, we will in some way compensate you
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.640]   for the losses that you incurred after we approved it and then pulled it.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.520]   People do itself a hell of a lot of good if they explained that all of this is AT&T's
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   fault.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   They're not.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.880]   They're just, they're just eating it.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.520]   You think they can't?
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   I think they can.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.480]   You know, you think they can.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.480]   I don't think they can.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.320]   I think that's part of the, they just have to suck it up.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.000]   Again, I've had conversations with people at Apple like fairly high up and you talked
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.480]   them about AT&T and even in these situations, you know that their questions they can't answer.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.320]   But you get, I don't know.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:08.920]   I was about to say something that was based on my reading body language and intonations
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.000]   where I suppose I shouldn't say that.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.200]   But as I said, it's one of the reasons why I am inclined to extend some benefit of the
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.640]   doubt to Apple when again, it could be an AT&T partnership problem as opposed to Apple
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.760]   just being shortsighted or Apple being jerks.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.840]   All right.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.560]   We'll give them the benefit of that.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.840]   Again, that's not necessarily given the benefit of the doubt.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.720]   That's one of the possibilities.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.160]   Of all the reasons in front of us, I don't want to jump to again.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.880]   You get to 10 or 12 hours.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   Yeah, you know, when Apple, Apple put DRM on the music, we blame the record industry.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.080]   When Apple was the record industry.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.640]   Apple didn't gain anything from the DRM.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.000]   I mean, they didn't care because half the stuff people were putting on there didn't
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   have any DRM.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   It wasn't, it wasn't a matter of them buying all that stuff.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I mean, it didn't help Apple at all.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.840]   You know, they had to do that because that was the only way they could persuade the music
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.600]   industry to let them sell.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   And the first one.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.120]   This log jam breaks when Apple goes to Verizon.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.800]   It doesn't though because Verizon will have equally draconian restrictions on what people
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   can do with the phone.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.520]   Yeah, really breaks if Apple decided that they open it.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.440]   Well, or they build their own cell network because all the people with the iPhone, I
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.520]   mean, I think they're the biggest issue that these companies have is that, you know,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.720]   Apple, all these people with an iPhone, almost all these people on iPhone, if Apple opened
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.160]   its own competitive cell network, I know I'd just switch over.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.760]   You know, if I just, you know, I'd be like, you know, the heck with the, you know, I'd
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   just move over to it completely.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.560]   Yeah, I mean, it takes me back to the when the iPhone was released and I said, Apple,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.720]   why, why, why, why, why, why don't you just make an open phone like Nokia makes an unlocked
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.160]   phone and let us choose and then subsequent, of course, their reasons why.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.640]   But then subsequently, you know, ask the same question.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:50.200]   You know, Apple, you know, sometimes you think that they could make choices that are more
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.920]   consumer friendly, but they make the right business choice.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.040]   And so I guess that that's the point, right?
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   It's what you said.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   They don't care.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Right.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.120]   They don't have to.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.880]   But as a consumer, I wish they would.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.840]   Well, I think that I think that they, but they make deals that I think oftentimes that
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.000]   you couldn't make otherwise.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.920]   I mean, when they made the deal, well, the record company deal ended up working out
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   well.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.800]   They got such dominance in the music industry.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.480]   They were able to then strong arm the record companies and say, okay, no more DRM.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   Right.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   So that worked.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.920]   Well, and they, and no one was really effectively selling music before that.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.880]   The only way they got the deal of being able to sell these without subscriptions, you know,
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.600]   song by song in mass, you know, with all, with all of those songs available was to agree
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.320]   to these DRM, you know, restrictions.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.920]   What about people like Gina Trapani and our Google show, Mike Arrington of TechCrunch,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.920]   who said, I'm not going to, I'm giving up the iPhone.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.400]   I'm not going to use it until it becomes a more open platform.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.360]   I couldn't, you know, I'd like to.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.760]   I really would.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.440]   But I've got just one more level on I dig it to get to.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.400]   And if I, you know, I give it up now.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   Well, I'm going for level 200 on field runners, you know.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:02.200]   So I'm still killing myself and I spent six months on my poker dice game.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.480]   And then when I moved to a new phone, I lost my high scores.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.560]   I mean, that's definitely their prerogative.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.120]   And you got to use the phone that works best for you for whatever reason.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.200]   I would never make a decision on what technology I use based on dogma and based on philosophy.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.920]   It always has to be, I don't care.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   This is a locked up system.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   I don't care that this is copyrighted and patented up the wazoo.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.040]   I care the fact that when I'm in Beijing and I'm trying to find out where I'm going and
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.880]   I'm trying to get, you know, get, get worked on and get jobs done, that this is the quickest
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.440]   point for the quickest trip from A to B is through my iPhone.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:41.240]   Every time I do have an absolutely totally open source phone that came on about a year
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.320]   and a half, two years ago.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.400]   And the only satisfaction that you get in operating it is knowing that, hey, I'm sticking
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   it to the man.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.000]   This is all over your political satisfaction only.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.600]   It only goes so far.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.240]   It's like, wow, so I bet your contact manager is great.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.760]   Well, no, it stores 10 numbers.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.960]   Oh, well, I can put some of these in hotkeys.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.920]   Well, no, but hey, it's open source.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.360]   If you want to learn C plus plus and learn how our compiler works and learn how our APIs
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.520]   work, you can add your own phone book.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.120]   I really would rather just get that free with the phone.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.480]   Yeah, but not by giving your contacts to a big corporation, man.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.200]   I do think that the one thing that the first chink in the armor for me to start looking
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.280]   at, I mean, and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, but if Apple continued to block Google
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.720]   Voice, I have to say that I'm, you know, I've started on my business card as my Google
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   Voice number, not my, not my, my cell number.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.840]   You know, I'm moving as many things to Google Voice as possible.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.280]   And I could see a year or two down the road picking a palm pre or something else because
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.120]   I want to have direct access.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.720]   I want to have my phone operate as a Google Voice platform rather than a, you know, rather
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   than a hernical.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.320]   So this is a, I think that this is not right now, but a year or two down the road if Apple
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   is not so non-sportable.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.400]   That could be a critical form of functionality that you might be willing to change.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.320]   Yeah, that would be, that would be the thing that, that I would, that I could see myself
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   tempted to move from.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.200]   Let's not forget that we also have now the Google G2 phone that the Android operating
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.640]   system is there, they haven't forgotten about it.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.720]   They keep updating, keep making it stronger and better.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.240]   And that, you know, that's where, by the way, both these people have abandoned the iPhone
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.840]   4s. Exactly. And it is, it is one of the best phones out there.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.880]   If I, if, if again, if, if Steve Jobs ever said something horrible about my mother, then
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.480]   I would say, and then I could look at that Apple logo without vomiting, then that would
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.360]   probably almost certainly be the phone that I would switch to because it's an awesome
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   phone.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.920]   And my only concern is that I don't, again, I don't care about the principle of open source.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.600]   I don't care about the principle of freedom as long as I have the freedom to do what I
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.000]   personally want.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.600]   But if Apple really wants to hold on to this market share they have, they're going to have
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.400]   to look, they, they have to skip ahead to the end of the book there and see what happens
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:54.760]   in two years from now when, again, Google phones and, and, and Palm, Palm are also making
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.560]   these inroads, picking up all these people that Apple is alienating with all these policies.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.640]   So again, it should be an Apple's best interest to realize this is going to be a big problem
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   soon.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.400]   Yeah, they need, they need to go open a little bit.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.280]   Another story just came in actually that Apple has been has kicked 900 applications from
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.800]   the Apple store in mass in mass, but don't get too upset.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.880]   The programs like top sexy ladies or soapers stars update.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:32.480]   This is a developer Khalid Sheik or shake has his had his Apple store license withdrawn
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.520]   and over 900 applications removed Apple told the developer this is because of multiple complaints
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.720]   that his applications infringed other people's intellectual property.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.120]   The persistent natures of such complaints has led us to conclude that you are entering
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.400]   into the representations and warranties in the IDP agreement and bad faith by misrepresenting
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.360]   that you have all the necessary rights for your submissions.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.440]   Most of his applications cost 4.99.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.680]   They tend to be aggregation applications which gather articles and images from websites.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.920]   So not much of a loss yet.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   26 people working for him, 900 applications seems like he found a gold mine in the store.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   But where?
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.760]   Where were they working for him?
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   Well, 900 people.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.720]   I mean, I was 26, I'm sorry, 26 people, you know, it depends on you.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.840]   I'm sure they were cheap workers somewhere, which means he made all the more money.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   This is something that I think that's not unreasonable.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.160]   People forget that we have this fantasy of two guys on a kitchen table hand crafting software
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.360]   then making their way in the world that oftentimes it's no, these are offices with marketing plans
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.880]   and business plans and large staffs and that there can be thousands and tens of thousands
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.240]   of dollars invested in building each one of these apps.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.680]   So when Apple dis arbitrarily says, nah, then that's a huge hit for a company to absorb.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:00.600]   And it can destroy a company, it can also destroy another company's plans to even make
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.520]   that kind of a risk in porting a really good app to the iPhone.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.960]   Ivan says in our chat room, no, the point here, Leo, is the arbitrary BS that is Apple's
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.400]   criteria to entry into the app store.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.520]   It's all of his apps were approved at one point.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520]   But I think that that's not the point.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.960]   Ivan, if they were approved because Apple wasn't aware of the IP violations or thought
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.920]   this was okay, and then started receiving multiple complaints is the same thing as a
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   video, you know, has been approved and put on YouTube, but then gets a DMCA takedown.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   YouTube takes it down.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.320]   I don't think that that's unreasonable.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.920]   Well, it's it is different because when YouTube takes a video down because some guy like me
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.520]   took a clip from last night's TV show, last night's Big Bang Theory and put it all on
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.760]   with it sounds like that's what this guy kind of was doing, aggregating other people's
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760]   content.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.640]   Okay, then I then then I correct myself.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.600]   What I was responding to is the idea of just the basic idea of Apple approving something
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.720]   and then saying, no, I'm going to undo that.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.560]   I'm not going to I'm going to do you prove your application.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.240]   I would like to think that they should be more careful that when they the approval process
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.160]   should be more than a yes or no, click one button.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.600]   You have 10 seconds to look at the screen before you look at the next screen and approve
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600]   the next step.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.760]   Because I think that as soon as as soon as they approve an application, Apple has a responsibility
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.680]   to the developer, maybe not to keep that in the store forever, but at least to say, okay,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.120]   I acknowledge that I'm kind of screwed you up by letting you sell this for a certain time
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.560]   and then simply pulling it.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.800]   Look, if they if if if these complaints didn't come to surf to come to light originally, the
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.240]   guy asserted he owned the rights turns out he didn't, you know, look at nobody's saying
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.560]   that the approval process is perfect is clearly not right.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.840]   And this guy, I mean, the guy's upset because he invested a lot of money in a company to
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.400]   make apps, but perhaps I guess is, you know, the I'm not as sympathetic perhaps as I finish.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:50.160]   You know, I I, you know, we develop applications for Apple in general and and the we are working
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.200]   on applications for the iPhone.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.560]   And I have to admit that we are finding a niche that that we think is really good for us,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.840]   but we're also not experimenting with the boundaries.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.040]   And I get that that there's something, you know, I think that a lot of people who are
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.880]   getting themselves, um, uh, the law and you won't be in problem.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.640]   Well, I'm just saying I'm just saying that that if you're going to if I was going to
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.600]   build a company with 26 people, I would not be basing that entire company on things that
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.960]   might be in a what I would call a gray area.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   You know, that's all.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.840]   Well, I just I think from just some business sense.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   You know, yeah, that's all.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.280]   Well, you know, look, if you're doing apps for Facebook, if you're doing apps for the
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.000]   iPhone store, you're doing a deal with the devil.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.320]   You're saying, I, I think I'm going to make a lot of money here because of the platform,
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.160]   but I understand that the rug could be pulled out from under me.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.040]   I mean, I, I have with our company.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.280]   I'm constantly sure.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.600]   I mean, I'm doing production and we, we know that the rug could be pulled out from us any
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   moment.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.360]   You know, we were all kind of.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.960]   You're always kind of, you're kind of in that.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.280]   I mean, when you start a company and, but when you, but when you start going up against
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.680]   things where you see that Apple can be capricious about how it handles it, you know, dealing,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.000]   you know, putting a lot of people, you know, that tens of thousands of people have gotten
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.360]   their, their apps approved and not had them pulled down.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   So we're talking about exceptions.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.000]   And most of those apps, whether they're good or bad are, you know, they 900's a lot.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.520]   That's a lot of apps to get.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.800]   Well, it'd be interesting to see what those, those apps are.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400]   Well, are they all, are they all apparently, I don't know.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.160]   I mean, adult oriented.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.320]   Not adult aggregating a content.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:26.760]   So the soap stars is aggregating stories from other websites about the soap stars.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.280]   And I, you know, this actually comes down to this bigger issue of the link economy and
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.840]   whether, you know, how far you can go cross linking.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.080]   And if you're aggregating, is that just a news reader with a particular topic?
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.920]   How is that different from that news wire?
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   Right.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   You know, and so they're larger questions there, which I'm afraid I don't have enough
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.680]   information about his applications to really be able to talk about.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   The fiery iPod are topic in a moment.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.960]   The case of the fiery iPod and a firmware hack that makes Apple keyboards.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.240]   Well, the property of somebody else.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.920]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   But right now I want to mention our friends at go to meeting.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.400]   It's time for a Citrix commercial, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm happy to do these
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.520]   because I've known these guys for a long time.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.160]   They make great software, very useful stuff.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.720]   And I'm really pleased that go to meeting is now Mac compatible.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.360]   You want to applaud them for making their software.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.800]   You know, the original Citrix stuff was Windows based because they were one of, you
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.400]   know, the guy who started Citrix was one of the key developers.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.440]   He worked for IBM, but he's in the key developers on Windows NT's kernel.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.080]   He knew remote access.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.560]   So their first products were unapologetically Windows based.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.360]   But I just love it that they have said, well, we've got a great platform here.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.600]   Let's extend it to the Mac and now go to meeting is compatible Mac and PC.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.040]   This is great meeting software.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.720]   We use it now on some of our shows so that we can show you screenshots remotely can
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.360]   be used that way.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:00.280]   The idea is instead of having those meetings in person on the phone, driving into, you
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:06.840]   know, cross, not in person on the phone in person instead of on the phone, driving across
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.120]   town or flying across country for those meetings, you could do a conference call, I guess.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.960]   But the problem is they're just not very visual.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   You can't really see the key note or the PowerPoint presentation.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.080]   You can't see the drawings, the website you're talking about.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.920]   It's kind of difficult to get that across in a conference call.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.120]   And so that's where Godam meeting really kind of takes the conference call to the next level.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.720]   It makes it visual.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   You set it up.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Take just a couple of minutes.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.880]   In fact, you can do it now for free for 30 days.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.160]   Go to Godam meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.320]   Once you sign up for the 30 day trial and press the download button, literally it's two minutes
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   to install.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.680]   And now you're ready.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.000]   You can set it up so that the meeting invites are set out ahead of time via email.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.080]   Or if you're on the phone with somebody, right, you know, we do this all the time.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.280]   Ray will say, okay, here's the meeting ID and he'll whisper the meeting ID to me.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.560]   I just go to go to meeting.com, press join a meeting and in the meeting ID.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.720]   And there I'm seeing raised desktop.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.880]   I could see all the drawings, everything he's doing.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.480]   He usually does a PowerPoint presentation or I'm sure if he's using PowerPoint or keynote.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.440]   But sometimes it could be pictures, product demos.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.160]   You can even use it for training, collaboration as well.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.440]   And I'll tell you, you know, when you look at the cost of flying across the country or
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.360]   driving across town, $49 a month for unlimited meetings as long as you want is a real deal.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.880]   But it's free for the next 30 days.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.600]   This includes phone and voice over IP conferencing, by the way.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.440]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.880]   G-O-T-O meeting.com/macbreak and try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.560]   I know, I know you're going to love it.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.640]   So the case of the burning iPod.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   It's hot.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   He he.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.320]   Had to say it.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.720]   So here's the deal.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.280]   A guy buys an iPod for his teenage daughter.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.120]   In fact, there's a picture of her on the Daily Tech website if you want to see her in the
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:02.960]   fiery, the flaming iPod, which he's holding with a rubber glove, probably because she
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.040]   doesn't want to get contaminated.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.160]   So Ken Stanborough bought an iPod touch for his 11 year old daughter.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.480]   When holding the iPod one warm day last month, it began to overheat.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.920]   He says, quote, it made a hissing noise.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.160]   I could feel it getting hotter in my hand.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.800]   I thought I could see vapor.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.720]   So he's flipping it back and forth hand to hand.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.080]   And then he finally goes, it's hot and throws it out the window.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.280]   He reports within 30 seconds, there was a pop, a big puff of smoke, and it went flying
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.880]   10 feet in the air.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   It's good thing he didn't have in his pocket.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.200]   Was he listening to the theme for mission impossible and that happened?
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   Exactly.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   So I bought a little self-destruct.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.080]   He contacted Apple, hoping for an apology or a refund anyway.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.160]   He spoke to several departments, spoke to an Apple executive on the phone.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.840]   They didn't promise him a refund.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.800]   Seems like the refund since his brand new would be like, yeah, like automatic.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   That's why I'm puzzled.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   According to the Times Online, instead he got an offer saying a letter saying, we'll give
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.560]   you a refund, but you have to agree to a gag order.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.720]   You will keep the terms and existence of this settlement agreement completely confidential.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.580]   Violation may result in Apple seeking injunctive relief damages and legal costs against the
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.280]   defaulting parisons or parties.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.680]   He says, look, I just want a refund on which he is.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.200]   I absolutely entitled to, I don't know what British law says, but certainly in the States,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.080]   absolutely entitled to a refund for a defective product that explodes in his hands.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.840]   And he said, I wasn't looking for damages.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.840]   I can understand this must have just gone to the wrong legal department.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.320]   Apple should give by now.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.800]   They must have given him a refund.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.560]   He says, I didn't sign the agreement because I didn't want to get sued.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:48.040]   If by accident, my daughter or somebody mentions this to somebody, I think he's right not to
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   sign it.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.560]   Apple spokesperson says they could not comment on their cases.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.960]   They had not yet seen the iPod.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:02.480]   But did the story say that the reason it started doing that after he dropped it?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.720]   Yeah, I guess that's what happened.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.840]   So I can see this being sort of one of these automatic where customer service doesn't really
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.400]   like listen to the whole story where they heard the phrase, well, I dropped the iPod.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.000]   And at that point, they just sort of started filling out the forms for we can give you a
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.800]   10% discount on replacing it, but we don't replace damages caused by dropping it.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.560]   I threw it in a bucket of water before it burned my ass down.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.080]   If you look at the picture of the iPod, it clearly wasn't a case of being dropped.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.520]   It was a case of bursting into a fiery ball of flame.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.280]   Unless he took a blowtorch to it.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   No, no, I mean, that I mean that dropped, it broke something cause one cause the battery
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   to contact something else.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.160]   And that was the cause of the ignite.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.240]   Although I think this is your right.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.280]   I think this is a bookkeeping error.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   Somebody said.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.000]   It would be like corporate policy when I started developing personal electronics that when something
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.120]   with my logo on it ignites, you get bumped up to supervisor.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.440]   You get a free one.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.640]   Well, no, no, let's let's let's not lose our heads here.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.680]   You're definitely you're definitely getting a free hat.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   We'll give you a discount.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   Free hat.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.840]   We'll give you 10% off.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.440]   I guess I guess Leo doesn't want a free hat then.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.800]   No, no, no, I think this guy quite reasonably wants a replacement.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.200]   I'm kind of curious what the computer companies what the lat like Sony did.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.080]   And their laptops were catching fire because all this is connected to these batteries,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   right?
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.560]   50 my own batteries, which are explosive if probably if they get shorter, right?
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.640]   You know, they get shorter.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.000]   They, they, you know, it's a chemical reaction.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Yep.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.920]   And they, they'd accelerate the chemical reaction.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   He'd sit up and it happens from time to time.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.160]   My advice, if you start feeling a warm sensation in your pocket is to remove the iPod and
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   stand away from it.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.480]   If you're in a plane, that would be bad.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.080]   And then they'll say, then they won't let us take the iPhone after that whole fire thing.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.040]   It was always like, you know, you can't some airlines did in fact prevent, prevent people
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.120]   from bringing lithium ion batteries on, on board that you could take your laptop, but
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   it couldn't have a battery.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.440]   They said, it's had an Apple laptop and I say, yes, you can't open that.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   It couldn't turn it on.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.840]   It was like for like a month.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.800]   And then, and then the other thing that now, now they're saying, you know, you, you have
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.200]   to turn your phone off and airport airplane mode doesn't count.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   What?
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   That was the new one.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.840]   That was the new one on, on United.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   Is that for the whole flight?
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.760]   In Chicago or just the takeoff and landing?
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.240]   No, for takeoff and landing.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.560]   Oh, yeah, because that's a, they say, Oh, look, you have to turn your iPod off for takeoff
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.720]   and landing.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.640]   I just put it on airplane airplane mode.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   No, no, no, you have to turn it off.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.120]   You're that guy next in the next seat that I hate because he's not following the rules.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   Exactly.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.720]   This is the pictures with my iPhone on the way out.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   You're not allowed to.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.840]   Like, see, this is, see people, you see a lot of people like in message groups saying,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.040]   well, you know, there's no, there's part of the fascism of like, of corporate mentality
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.800]   that there's no technical reason why you shouldn't, you should have to turn off because
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   turn off these devices.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.640]   There's no way they could possibly interfere with the avionics or the communication system.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.920]   And then, but you have to like be anthropological and realize that if they say, please turn
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.440]   off the falling list of devices, if this, if you think it's going to interfere, they're
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.680]   going to get everybody like me, like Alex saying, excuse me, flight attendant, you're
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.200]   obviously not aware of this.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.400]   Does not, this uses the Rockwell chipset, not the Adam chipset.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.840]   That's like, I don't, see, I don't, I don't argue with them.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   I don't do anything.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   I just wait until they pass.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.440]   I think, I think, I think the next, okay, Alex, you, you, you provide the capital, I'll
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.160]   provide the engineering and the marketing.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   We'll sell a line of it's, it looks like a series of screen protectors, same technology.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.580]   But what it is is it's like a little sheet of absolute matte black plastic over your
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.580]   screen.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.280]   They'll make it look like it's turned off, but after the stewardess comes by, you simply
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.480]   pale, peel it away and you're back playing.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.840]   Can you just do me a favor?
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.400]   Just turn the damn thing off.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.880]   Please.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.560]   If the plane goes down, cause of you, you don't want to be that guy.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.640]   You know what, you know, you don't, you don't want to be that guy.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   Just turn it off.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.840]   It's 10 minutes.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   I could see if they said you can't use it for the whole flight.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   Okay, then I understand.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   I just don't want to deal with the start at the time again.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.000]   Oh, see what, what, what, what's that little bing when it goes thing?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.240]   Oh, I don't turn it all the way off.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.480]   I just press the off button.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.800]   No, I turn that off.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.480]   But they say they're telling you that you have to turn it all the way off.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.440]   Oh, yeah, I understand that.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.480]   And my whole thing is, is that I'm not going to turn it all the way off.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   I'll put it.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   I'll put it.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   I'll put it all the way off.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.000]   You put it, put it back in my pocket and I read the economist until we get to 10,000.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.080]   Again, you realize that like you're the next, the next time you fly, you're playing could
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.360]   get hit by an inbound missile.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.240]   But that's all it's going to be an MSNBC in the Today show.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.720]   Say, we have, we have recording of one of the passengers insisting with just a day before
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:37.160]   that he did, he was never going to turn off any of his in flight things and strict denying
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.120]   the orders of the flight attendants.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.760]   Of course, I have his picture right here.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.080]   I was talking to, I was talking to, there was an aircraft engineer next to me and I asked
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   him.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   I was like, so what's the deal with this whole like turn of the phone off?
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   No, what are you reason this?
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.680]   Well, he said, he said, oh, it doesn't, he does, he said it, it may affect older planes,
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.480]   audio systems, because you hear the clicking, you know, the clicking, you know, like, you
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.800]   know, the, the, the communication systems, it may affect that.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.160]   He goes, it won't affect the avionics.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.560]   He said, but the biggest reason you turn your phone off is he goes, because when your phone
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.200]   is searching, it is at full power radiation.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.680]   And he goes, and, and he goes, you do not want, I mean, he goes, basically for five hours,
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.040]   and goes, number one, is it, if you're worried about, if you have any worry about getting
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.280]   cancer from a phone, that's the time to worry because you, it's on full power for four hours
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   or five hours, and there's about a three foot radius that it's radiating.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   Right.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   And then he said, the second thing though, is that, you know, the most important thing
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.320]   that he pointed out was, it'll crisp your back, it'll just burn your battery down.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.080]   So when you get off the plane, you won't have any battery power.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Right.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.680]   That one, well, it's probably not good for the cell towers either as, as, as you get these
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.080]   rapid handoffs and I mean, yeah, I could see turning your phone off.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   Yeah, I don't have any problem with that.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   Yeah, turn your phone.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   It doesn't work.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   I try.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   I try.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.880]   Such a jerk.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.400]   You don't, you're not the guy who stays on the phone till they close the door talking
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.240]   loudly about business deals, are you?
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   I do not talk on the phone in a plane.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   Thank you.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   I, I, thank you.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   I take it personally.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.480]   Yeah, I ask the Mass Hall until they go back.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   That's fine.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   To be tapped all you want.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.360]   Oh man, people who talk, oh, they have loud conversations and the door's not closed.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.480]   And on the bus back from, from this, in a public space, basically, I don't really like,
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.640]   no, no, I'm in fact, I don't need to make a call on the, on the airport.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.040]   We have, there's an airport or bus for the SFO for the intake.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   But I'll talk like this.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   I'm on the bus.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   Can you pick me up?
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   Because I don't, yeah, that's annoying.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.760]   And there's people, there's always people behind me.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.440]   And then I says to him, I says, you never, so I have this with the edomotics are great
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.600]   for your shoes and be good for you.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.040]   Get this in here, sealing those headphones off and they can't hear a thing.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.720]   Air Canada makes you take your buds out of your, I think everybody does for take off
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   on landing.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   Yeah, I think everybody's.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   Even when you're getting on the plane, they don't want you.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   Oh, I think the big problem is I've, I've actually landed a couple of times, not knowing
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.560]   where we're going to land because I have my, my, my in ear, my, my in ear and I don't
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.160]   hear any of their announcements, anything else.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.400]   I mean, I don't hear anything with any.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   No, that's the problem with this.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.920]   And so I'm just sitting there, you know, happily going along and suddenly we're, you
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.440]   know, there, boom.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   I like to look at the window.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.080]   So I know when that bump, because that's scary.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.920]   Otherwise, when I like to lean forward on the bump, I've had a couple of bad bumps that
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920]   haven't been so good for my back.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.680]   So I got into when I see it coming, I put your head between your legs, like in the, I just,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.920]   no, I just lean forward a little bit.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.840]   I just make sure that I'm not straight up, like leaning back when it hits.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.960]   That's all funny to see Alex on a plane, me braces when we land.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   He just braces.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.280]   Well, you just, you just gave me an idea for like the, if I ever, if we ever like charter
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.360]   a flight, like a special trip or something, there are 20 people on board.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.800]   If we notice like there's one person who's fast asleep as we make final approach, you
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   understand, we'll be okay.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   Just don't say anything, just like assume the crash positions.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.600]   And then lower the gas masks because we, we just like, have you guys seen the New Zealand,
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600]   the New Zealand air?
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   Isn't that weird?
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.600]   That was fantastic.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   They're, they're safety.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.800]   Yeah, they're, they're painted.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.000]   They're naked, but they're painted.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.600]   I thought they did that very well.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   Did it very well.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.200]   And of course, they, you never see any naughty bits.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   Right.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   I've not seen it.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.320]   It's a, well, you know, the whole point is how do we get people to watch the air safety
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   announcements?
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   And that was a good way.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.720]   And so what they did is they had, the funny thing is the ad takes, because obviously these
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.840]   are not professional people.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.680]   And so they're, they're stewardesses or whatever, flight attendants.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.600]   So they're, they're body painted with their uniforms, but they're naked and they can't
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   stop.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   They can't deliver a line.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   They can't, they can't say a thing.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   Right.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   It's pretty funny.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   And it's compelling.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.640]   You keep, but you know why you're watching it.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.400]   You're watching to see if any naughty bits show, which they don't.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.480]   Well, I was, I was reading a memoir from a flight attendant who said that that was one
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.960]   of the tricks that like they used to use, uh, when they're just when they're trying
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.800]   to get a sense because they know they're going to be dealing with 200 total strangers
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.600]   for the next three hours in a, in a sealed tube that can't escape from that.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.520]   One of the things that keeping out for us, who, who is watching the stay safety video?
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   Great.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.520]   Those are people we don't don't worry about.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.520]   They're going to be great.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.320]   They're going to be really good to take care of.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   Uh, also on the other end of the scale was who do we have to remind to please turn off
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   that phone right now?
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.320]   Those are the people, those are the guys who you will not get away with anything with
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.920]   a person because she is watching you every step of the way.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.160]   Cause you are, you are the person who will disable the smoke detector in the lab.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.160]   Yes.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.160]   There's always one.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.160]   Excuse me.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.160]   I am a masters of engineering for MIT.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.760]   I know how to disconnect this and make sure it's reconnected properly.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.920]   See now, see now, I, I've, I've come to the opinion that they should, you know, for the
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:16.480]   escape, you know, the, uh, um, just to be on the, uh, uh, whatever the escape route.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   Escape out.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.240]   I like to call it the escape route.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.720]   So the exit rope, I think that if, if you take a like a $500 one day course on how to
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.600]   use the door and how to get off the, you should always get it.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   No, you should be out.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   You should have priority.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.100]   So if no one else has it, you should always be able to get it.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   I'm trained.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   I'm trained in escape artists.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.140]   I have a certificate that says, I know how to open that door and I, I would pay $500
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.080]   just to get on, just to get on that slide.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.440]   You know, put the arms across.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.080]   Steve Brill, paging, Steve Brill, another bad business idea.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.480]   It would be great.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.160]   I'm just picturing it like standing up the middle of the hotel.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.880]   So everybody, don't worry.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.840]   I've been certified in the car and exit opening.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.480]   So, so, of course the only reason I would do it is so that I have priority for ball
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   kid.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   Right.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.040]   You know, I just want to, you know, you're paying 500.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   It's like clear.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.680]   You're paying $500 for the, for access to leg room.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   And I would do it in a second.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.080]   I would pay $50 to sit next to somebody who's been certified and not putting 85 frickin
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.560]   pounds for the stuff in the overhead and both budget get right against the door.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to let you know we have officially entered this week in travel.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Give the rat.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   Hey, what about those guys?
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   I mean, that's all right.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   What's the deal?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   Hey, yeah.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.280]   Actually in the rattle zone.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.960]   I guess I was.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.360]   I guess I could talk about this.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.000]   We got, we got tired of saying such mean and ugly things about Apple, you know, we're
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.120]   not here to be seen toward Apple.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   Are we?
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   It's 80D day.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.080]   It is keyboards, Apple keyboards, vulnerable to firmware.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.480]   Heck.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.440]   This from OS news.com.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.760]   keyboards like all, you know, I think probably all PC keyboards have the same thing.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   They have flash memory.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   They have RAM.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   They have firmware.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.960]   Uh, K Chan, a security researcher, reporting his findings at the black hat conference.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.800]   He's found a way to easily install keystroke loggers and other malicious code right inside
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.320]   the keyboard in the existing RAM.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.480]   Uh, very easy to do this.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.400]   Thanks to apples.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:19.040]   HID firmware updater tool, which comes with every apple computer.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.520]   The tools run a breakpoint set.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.200]   You simply cut and paste the new code of the firmware image and memory.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.600]   That's it.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   Nothing is encrypted.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   Nothing decrypted.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   Simple to do.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.360]   And here's the key.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   You could do it remotely.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.320]   A malformed website.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   No problem.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.200]   And by the way, rebooting doesn't help.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.560]   You can't pull any batteries.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.800]   It's impossible to detect.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:44.960]   And with the one kilobyte of free space left inside the keyboard, that's quite a few keystrokes,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.320]   thousand keystrokes you can, you can store.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.040]   Uh, so just a word of warning.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.720]   I don't know what you do.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.400]   Stay away from malicious websites.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   My advice.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.480]   I think that these are always the best weeks out of the year, uh, when a black hat conference
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   is going on.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.800]   Uh, because this is the week when everybody's get everyone who comes up, everybody's whose
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.880]   job it is and whose hobby it is to come up with the most insanely wonderful and interesting
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.800]   ways of compromising a computer, guess together in one hotel, one hotel, uh, for about three
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   or four days.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.640]   And that's when all these stories come out.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.680]   Uh, and so usually it's sort of like a distant early warning system.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:23.240]   It's the, it's the, the thunder heads you see on the horizon that the fact that people
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.600]   are discovered, they have discovered this and are talking about it publicly.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.520]   It doesn't mean that this exploit is out there, but just that it's possible.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.720]   That gives everybody sort of a three or four month head start to sort of fix it before
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.880]   someone finds out a way to actually exploit it.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.680]   It's in the lab, but not in the wild.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.320]   It's a, it's a time when, yeah, this is a time when, uh, I mean, for the past, uh, for
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.720]   the past week, I can't tell you how many times I've been in conversations with editors and
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.440]   producers saying, is this a story?
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   I'm saying, well, probably not.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.720]   It's, it's, it's a story that you would run at the end of the week highlighting all the
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.160]   different things that have been discovered.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.320]   But no, this is not bump your bump, uh, the secretary of States interview on, on Monday
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   morning at eight AM to talk about this wonderful wildfire virus is going to be taking over
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   everybody's computer.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.480]   As, as we know anybody who's, who's actually been attacked by these in the, in like, I
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:13.040]   don't, well, this was just announced last week, but I'm saying with any of these, I haven't,
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.880]   I haven't had an apple.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   Uh, you might not know.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.280]   I mean, I, I mean, this particularly wanted, you wouldn't, there's no way of knowing you've
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   been hacked.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.320]   But I think there's been, we were talking about other hacks and other firmware hacks and
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.880]   other quick time hacks and SMS hacks and there's a, and there's always the case at Black Hat.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.880]   There's a lot of stuff announced.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.880]   Right.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.960]   I mean, I, I think we, we haven't gotten to it yet, but the big story about the SMS hack
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   on, uh, on the iPhone, I didn't hear about it, but thank God apple put that, I didn't
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.720]   hear about anybody getting hacked, but thank God apple put that at patch out because they
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.320]   would have been right.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.640]   I mean, that was, that's a, that's a huge one and there's a lot of money to be made and
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.920]   there are a lot of iPhones out there.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   Right.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.680]   The problem with the keyboard hack is, you know, so it's not so easy to get the information
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   out of the keyboard.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   Right.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   Uh, you know, you, you could do this, but there's, you know, to be perfectly honest,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.320]   you can do this on a PC keyboard too.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.720]   And there's a lot more of them out there.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   Right.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.360]   A lot of these, a lot of these hacks, they do take the form of urban legends almost.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.520]   They, they are real, but it's, it's more like you don't hear about, oh, well, a friend
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.920]   of mine, okay, or a friend of a friend, he was hiking to the Amazon.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.840]   He got bit by a mosquito and it really ish for like four days and he had to like put
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.120]   something topical on it for the wealth meltdown.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.680]   That's not, and that's not a good urban legend.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.000]   It's, while there was an earwig that totaled into his ear canal and laid these eggs beyond
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.160]   the eardrum and took over his brain.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.120]   I said that on that gallery, man.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   So I mean, literally it's the same thing.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.480]   Well, there is this sort of a quick time exploit that if you have an unpashed version of,
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.280]   of quick time embedded player, then if they properly malformed website can blah, blah,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   blah, that isn't a really great thing to report a black hat, but there is a way to put a,
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.200]   put a virus inside your keyboard.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   Right.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.320]   That where you can't antivirus program, can't find it.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   You can't reflash.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   You have to throw away your keyboard.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.680]   Well, I would point out that all PC keyboards have firmware as well.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.160]   And this is not an unusual thing.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.000]   And this, you know, this is not a strange hack.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.320]   It's, it's the, it's the meme.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.880]   It's like the ones that are more compelling and make more much better.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   It's fashionable.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.480]   One of these guys to be out there doing that because that it, well, thank goodness.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.600]   I hope Apple will, it's great that they're showing all of the stuff and they're telling
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.360]   people that this is possible because, you know, it'll be fixed by the time someone actually
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   gets around to using it.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   Newell in our friend feed chat room says he had a first generation iPod touch.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.520]   So it was out of, out of warranty, grossly overheated in his pocket by bicycling, enormously
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   hot and dangerous.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.800]   He stopped or moved it, let it cool down.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.360]   It didn't explode, but Apple replaced it.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   No problem.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.000]   And I think that that's probably them again.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.920]   That's the case in most of the, so what happens is these outliers, whether it's a firmware
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:41.800]   of hacks on the keyboard or the, or the iPod that explodes or the, they make newsworthy
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   stories.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   Right.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.480]   What you don't hear is the 100,000 people who did have overheating batteries have got
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   them replaced.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.680]   Or I had a problem with my headphone jack and they replaced my iPhone.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.080]   That's, that's what I haven't had.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   Really?
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.760]   It wasn't, it couldn't see the headphone anymore.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   This was, this was my first generation.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.560]   And then they handed me another one and then I went about my, my business breaks.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   Not, not to diminish the importance of this story.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.720]   I mean, that's not a good thing if you could go to a bad guy's website and you could flash
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.800]   your keyboard.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.960]   It doesn't talk about how you would retrieve that data.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   Right.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   It's more of a proof of it.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   It's, it's exactly what we said.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   We're just going to have a concept.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.760]   Well, you know, I, I would hope that Apple would somehow modify the keyboard, the HID
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.280]   firmware, a theater to not do that.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.160]   I'm probably seeing an update in the next couple of weeks.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.280]   I would hope so weeks, months, most keyboards are not secured.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   You know, the encryption on a keyboards is, is terrible.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.920]   You have a wireless keyboard.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.600]   Anybody across the room can see what you're typing.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   You don't need a keystroke locker.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   It's not anybody else.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.960]   You can also see what you're typing by turning around in their chair.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:47.240]   There's actually a very, a great start we talked about on security now, about a consultant
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:52.480]   who sat across the street, was able to monitor a wireless keyboard across the street, get
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.120]   a ton of business information, go back to the company saying, I know this, I know this,
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   I know this, I know this, all because your, you know, Logitech keyboard is broadcasting.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   Right.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.200]   You know, a Bluetooth keyboard is a huge danger.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.000]   Well, and I think also that, you know, they have software now that just looks at the pattern
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.040]   of your typing and it can be very accurate.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.200]   You know, it's a whole other, yeah.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.960]   It can actually calculate it just by just by knowing how, what, you know, the cadence
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.360]   in which you're typing their, their accuracy.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.480]   I think it was, I think it was like over 80%.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.840]   And there are and have been for a long time, keystroke loggers, chips you can embed in keyboards,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   you could bring a hundred keyboards to a business.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.000]   You could put them all in there.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.320]   No, keyboard sanitation service, get the keyboard back.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   And I mean, this has been around for ages.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.480]   You know, in fact, I know, I would be very careful about using public computers because
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.560]   just assume they have a keystroke longer on them.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   Right.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.880]   You know, many of them do.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.920]   So this is not, I mean, let's just put this in perspective.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.440]   However, we're reporting on it because we care.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   We want you to know.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   We report, you decide.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   No, we decide.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   We do it all.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.440]   That's what we're here for.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.440]   Let's see.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.240]   What else that we have on the agenda.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   Someone said they've tested the tablet.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:17.440]   Yes, an analyst said, wouldn't say anything more that merely that he tested the tablet.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.520]   Do you now credit the financial times?
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.000]   Do you think next month this is Apple insider says it's going to be next month?
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.360]   No, Apple, did Apple was, did they publish that today or earlier today?
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.440]   Did they publish something specifically saying that they, Apple and cider has been holding
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   that's going to be 2010.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.360]   Oh, they're saying 2010.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.360]   Yes.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   Yesterday.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.160]   This is a mashable mashable.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.040]   Yeah, insider, you're right.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.800]   Last week, insider was the one who said, no, no, we think it's 2010 financial times think
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.040]   it's at September.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.080]   But now the list is saying it's close.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   It's close.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.880]   It's, I still really doubt that it.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.200]   If the only way that I think they could ship it in September, if is if it's real purpose
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.640]   is as a media player, as a music device, as a book reader device and as an HD movie device,
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   because as we've been saying, I really think that the way to get people to spend $500,
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.120]   $600, $700 for this is to make it into something better than just a media player.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:20.560]   But if they were to simply say, release it in September, sell a lot of them for Christmas
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.760]   and promise that they're going to be apps for it next year.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.120]   Oh, no, by the way, developers.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.320]   There's a new kit for software.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.400]   Here's here's lessons here.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.000]   Some videos for how to do it.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.720]   That's the only way I could possibly see them shipping it in September.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.680]   This is what the analyst says.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.560]   September launch or announcement November launch.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.480]   He says they're going to have a final design in the next six weeks to the device to be
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.400]   then announced to September manufactured and shipped November.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:51.160]   He says, Mr. analyst, whoever this guy is, 699 to 799.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.240]   But one of the things this guy saw was high definition video.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.400]   And he said, knock this socks off.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.120]   That's an interesting market, the high definition video player.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.520]   I think it's very probable.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.760]   I think that it's, I don't really have a strong opinion about when it'll happen.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   I do think it'll happen before March of next year, but I don't know.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.560]   I think it makes a great Christmas gift for me if anyone's watching.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   Me too.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.560]   I'd love it.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.000]   I'll be buying it for myself.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.920]   But it isn't interesting though.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.560]   Have you made up a list now of everybody who's going to be coming out with a tablet device
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.400]   in the next probable or release or announced in the next four to six months?
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.880]   We already have the Kindle DX.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   We have the Crunchpad that's going to be coming out.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   We have two different devices from two different publishers, including one that's being sponsored
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.520]   by Barnes and Noble.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.000]   We have something I can't talk about.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.280]   We also have Apple that's almost certainly going to be released in something soon.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.960]   And I'm wondering how many of these competitors are part of their plan is first Apple release
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.920]   is their tablet and then we react to it.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.160]   That's when we lock down our feature set.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.640]   Because I think the one big winner unquestionably is going to be the ebook market because we're
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.880]   finally going to have a situation in which there are going to be enough of these cheap
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.320]   tablets in play all the way from a really affordable Kindle all the way up to a super
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:12.240]   exclusive wonderful Apple tablet that now it's going to really make sense for everybody
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.120]   to simply by default publish everything as ebook along with the print titles.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.640]   So I think the tablet could be the real one of the big winners could be Adobe actually.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.040]   When you look at being able to use the PDF the way it was meant to be used.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:32.480]   I mean it's the PDF has so many features 3D, video embedding, hyperlink, all of that.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.040]   Nobody uses this stuff.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   Adobe doesn't use it.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.480]   What's crazy is they don't you get their PR stuff they could be adding.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   Would Apple support it you think?
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.240]   There's no reason why that's why you need something more than a Kindle.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.840]   You need something more than an ebook reader.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.440]   You really need something with some horsepower.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:52.440]   I mean if I could get manuals like for my application on my video I mean animation.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.200]   Yeah I mean it you know that it would be quite a thing.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.560]   I mean Apple would much rather have all that being done with HTML5.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.520]   I think they want PDF to standard for static text image or is that document imaging and
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.600]   not for anything interactive.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:11.640]   Maybe I you know I love my Kindle but I think that you're right Alex that would be a killer
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.840]   product if you could play that.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.840]   It just just color images.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.640]   But what's amazing is how much is in PDF and it just never gets used to it.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.880]   You know you always talked about Alex the idea that somebody should start you wanted
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.440]   to do this and he said companies should do this.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.000]   We start making video with embeddable links.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Quick time was able to do this.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   Right.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.440]   And then the kind of I don't know if it still can nobody does.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.880]   Well the way we did it with Macbreak when we were doing the R&D was we were using flash
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.920]   tracks within Quick Time to make it work and then Apple disabled them all for us.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:45.280]   So you know they slowly you know first they turn flash off by default and then they just
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.080]   took the flash.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.160]   So our old stuff doesn't work.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.360]   So then we had to move to and the problem is that there are quick time there are ways
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:57.480]   to do it in Quick Time but the applications required to do it are so archaic you know
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.880]   that it's very painful you know to add that interactivity.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:08.360]   And I think that's a big it's a huge thing that Apple has missed is not moving Quick Time
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:13.760]   into the future which is interactive video and I think Adobe is way ahead way ahead when
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.720]   it comes to flash you know you know that they are when it talks to interactivity.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.680]   Well it doesn't like flash right.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.080]   Well and I and I think that Apple has you know I was I was in an airport talking to a
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.040]   guy that said they're changing their whole website because one of the executives bought
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.840]   an iPhone and couldn't get to their own website with his iPhone and he just came in he walked
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.440]   into the office this is a big company and said I just want to read the flash.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.800]   We need to rebuild the entire website because I can't see it.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.560]   I'm on canvas and SVG and HTML.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.680]   He didn't care what it was he didn't care if it was he just what they're gonna have
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.680]   to do.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.120]   He's like I can't get to it on if I can't get to it on my own iPhone I'm not you know
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.640]   on my own phone you know this is where people are coming to our website and we're gonna have
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   to and that's I think that's part of Apple's you know trajectory is it slows that development
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.420]   down it has companies rethink whether they want to put flash in their site when every
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.560]   time someone with an iPhone gets to it you know in that crowd you're not going to be
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.040]   able to see it.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.160]   So the proof of concept is this Chris Brown song forever in the wedding dance video.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.320]   We were talking about that on Twitter yesterday.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.680]   Yeah so fantastic two weeks ago I mean this this is how fast this stuff happens this this
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.120]   video is coming gone this meme is over right but you probably all saw it I'd like to do
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:30.600]   my Tumblr log very early on I might have before that today show aired it in the first
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:35.360]   million in the first I was the first million views the you know it's the it's the I was
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.520]   in this YouTube video before it sold out.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.720]   It was all about getting hit in the crotch by a grapefruit.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   It still is.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.240]   There's actually well never mind.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:51.040]   This video is for those who haven't seen it for some reason maybe because you were out
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.080]   of the country or something is a wedding procession on which everybody dances right and there's
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.000]   a Chris Brown song playing in the background.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.200]   Now YouTube gave Chris Brown and his publishers the choice they said you can we can pull
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:09.520]   it down we can take out the audio or we can put an ad up for forever on the video he chose
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.440]   the latter smartly put the a lot of money with that it's back in the iTunes top 10 one
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.640]   year after the song came out.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:21.960]   Yeah the the the company and the and the artist have reaped a big benefit because in
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.920]   effect there's a clickable link right it's it proves your idea.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.440]   Yeah yeah I mean and now I think that we're going to see more of that I think that that
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.160]   was that's really the way to handle a lot of this.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.760]   So you could give away a template that had this kind of functionality and have it supported
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.280]   by this kind of revenue and but in Apple would know that they wouldn't need to give it away
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.840]   but they could they could give away an iPhone they make so much you know they you know the
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.400]   amount of money I spend on my on my AT&T bill and and the apps and the music and everything
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.320]   else you know they're definitely making way more money on that than they are from the
[00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:01.040]   the actual hardware but I think that you know this clickable I think that's the beginning
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.120]   I mean you know we've been we've been I love this idea I mean I read it so you see it really
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.560]   is a media device more than anything else.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.000]   I see it as this I mean I see it as an interface to everything we're doing when you look at
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.760]   augmented reality you know the augmented reality they're doing in New York with the subways.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.400]   That's where you have a browser you hold it up because the thing has GPS and a compass
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.440]   in it you hold it up and it could say that building you're looking at right now here's
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.160]   you know a directory or here's some information about it.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.400]   I mean I see that this is an interface to that I also think it's going to put an immense
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.160]   amount of pressure on companies who haven't adopted video you know for interacting with
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.240]   people it's going to put a lot of pressure on them to produce a lot of video because
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.360]   it's going to be you know people are going to expect it they're going to be you know
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.440]   when I get when I buy my stuff from a Kia I'm going to expect a video on how to put that
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.760]   darn thing together because it's you know that that that cryptic little piece of paper
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.200]   that they hand me with with my shelving is not sufficient.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.080]   Yeah you know and and it could be you know I like that idea you've got a new a key thing
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.960]   you just hold this up and say oh you see that piece put that piece or you can do that or
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.840]   even if you could just even if all I had was a 3d video and I just set my eye set this
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.760]   media pad up next to you know in my living room and sit there and or if I want to like
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.600]   have a if I want to learn how to make chicken court on blue I get to there and in piece
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.400]   by piece and this is something I can move around you maybe put a little cover over it
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.040]   when I'm in the kitchen but but set it down somewhere and be able to you know go through
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.520]   the step by step to put it together.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.840]   There are so many opportunities with you know with this device the iPhone is just a little
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.360]   too small because you can't see it from a distance you can't you know like when you're
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.000]   working on something right you can't you have to look too closely and it's not quite bigger
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.960]   so it's 10 and a half inches enough I think it is I think that's I mean we were when we
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.280]   were looking at building one a year ago you know over a year ago and we were talking to
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:50.880]   Korean company and everything else about the development of it and I miss I felt like
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   Apple was going to release one that last summer yeah and so I just felt like we weren't getting
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.200]   enough traction and drop the project and you know Tech crunch did not so there's going
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.520]   to be a crunch pad and there'll be some competition and now by the way we're seeing stories at
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.600]   Dell HP gateway and others are going to make tablets Mike this is so interesting because
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.960]   Microsoft tried to push this whole thing yeah five four years ago five years ago six years
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:19.440]   ago never had and it and it didn't go anywhere it didn't take off for a variety of reasons
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.480]   well the Internet Apple says let's do it Apple Apple doesn't even say let's do it the
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.840]   rumors of Apple maybe doing it are enough to get the other manufacturers yeah that's
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.720]   a good idea but I think Apple is good at waiting for things to become so pregnant that they
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.360]   have to happen like we were waiting for the I've we knew Apple is going to do a phone for
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.040]   what a year and a half two years we were talking about a phone I mean I held on to my little
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.220]   trio for a long time to waiting for Apple to finally release it you know and and so I
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.760]   think that you know we knew we were just frustrated that it hadn't come out and I think we're
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.320]   kind of and they do that very well you know where they wait until the market is really
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:03:00.400]   ready Apple though ever said they were going to do a tablet no no it's it's just it's just
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.360]   vaporware the difference is that Apple always thinks about what what about the context of
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:12.520]   a tablet needs to make sense we're God I'm sorry that was a I just realized that would
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   be a very good Sarah Palin comment that's that sound like technological commentary no
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.160]   what Apple does is that they don't just simply say let's build a tablet let's put the guts
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.800]   that we have in the software we have inside this form factor but let's figure out how
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.440]   the humans would use a tablet and what would make sense for that shape the reason why Microsoft's
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.840]   tablet OS failed is because it wasn't tablet OS it was Windows right with a couple of
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.200]   10 extensions and again I had one for about a month and I spent a lot of time closely peering
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.600]   at the screen with a little stylist trying to make that little stylist hit the little
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.680]   close box on the standard windows window but Alex has a point in that this is it's starting
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.760]   to reach the point where everybody's familiar enough and welcoming enough of these sort
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.280]   of portable media technologies that they could really start to see make a case for paying
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.240]   300 to 700 dollars for a tablet again their books everywhere there's media everywhere
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.600]   there's movies everywhere it's time and if you have a web browser you have 70% of all
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.360]   the software that you need but yeah that's the other that's the other key isn't it well
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:20.200]   that works yeah yeah that's the other key is a is a browser is is really the opposite
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.520]   and you have thousands of of app developers that now I mean there's a lot of those that
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.600]   no matter how much we talk about the app store there is all of those iPhone app developers
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.080]   are going to you open up a media pad and a thousand of them will be a thousand apps
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.160]   will be out 2000 apps will be out in a week maybe two you know I mean especially if they
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   get a two month warning if they've if they announce it in September and are going to
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.040]   release it in November they'll be 10,000 applications the day that the that the media
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.400]   pad ships you know I mean that's the I mean and you think the bulk of mobile media focused
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.920]   no I think they'll be everything they'll be the same thing that we saw I think they'll
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.320]   be the same thing that we saw for the iPhone just simply for the tablet with more stuff
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:05.120]   field runners be pretty good I don't like I gotta say oh poor Alex but how do you quietly
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:11.040]   never gonna get anything done ever again man I might actually have to do it when I'm
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.280]   not standing in line and that would be the yeah you can't bring that thing in line no
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.600]   no you're not doing it's the only way to deal with Starbucks in the morning is field
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:27.400]   runners let's see any other stories you kind of had an interesting thought Alex Lindsey
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.880]   oh Amazon has taken it started taking pre-orders this week for snow leopard Apple still says
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.720]   on their web page now I want to parse what Apple saying because you're of the opinion
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.040]   that you may we may see snow leopards sooner than September I think so I think of Amazon
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   my guess is if Amazon Apple Amazon may do things pre-order but Apple doesn't do pre-orders
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.960]   for very long and so you know I think of Amazon is doing a pre-order I think we're gonna see
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.080]   it in weeks not so let me parse the language because it does say on the web page Mac OS
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:05.480]   10 snow leopard coming September 2009 with every new Mac right so so you could be shipping
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.520]   it earlier you could ship the upgrade sooner yeah so that's that's the no that's the September
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:19.320]   is with the new Macs upgrade from echo is 10 leopard for just $29 so that's a separate
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:24.080]   sentence so if we parse right but definitely if it's by September I think that the latest
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.520]   it would be this the first week of September I mean I think they're gonna come right out
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   with it I must be September one I mean yeah you know I could see Amazon taking orders a
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.440]   month early yeah yeah but I think it's I definitely think is that I don't think snow leopard
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.120]   is behind schedule I don't think it's gonna slip I don't think it's gonna be done I think
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.600]   it's done yeah you don't take pre-orders or something it's not done yeah well unless you're
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.800]   Microsoft no you should you don't take pre-orders you ship it now are you gonna buy the five
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:53.680]   licensed family pack and you're a good citizen I'll probably buy a couple of those wow that's
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.280]   a really good citizen you know I've just I don't know why but it sort of made me think of
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.520]   like the Kellogg's variety pack where you get three copies of snow leopard you get one copy
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.680]   of 10.2 and you get two copies of Linux and it's like there's always that who get okay
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:18.960]   who gets the all brand the family pack is is a $99 is that right no $49 for five $49 for
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.400]   five I just I just ordered it yeah I'll at least get that did I say five the reason we'll
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.160]   get a couple is because I want to I need more than one installer disc we find that $10 a
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.640]   computer right and we need the my biggest problem is we lose the install it is so one
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.560]   gets scratched or something like that so I'll get a couple just so I have more install
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.280]   now of course got to remember you got to have a leopard on this system you can't all
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.840]   afraid of anything else yeah that's one of the best piece of advice when you get it when
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.480]   you get a new copy of your OS installer disc immediately go into disk utility and build
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.800]   a disk image of it and put it on one of you one of those big like one terabyte hard
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.200]   right you know we've got trouble with that really we've had trouble with the installers
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.960]   I you know I don't know if it's been with OS 10 but we've I we've we we back up we try
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.560]   to back up all of our install discs for that reason and I know that we can't do that with
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:09.520]   vinyl can you use one of the EFI utilities to make a USB key that is the same as an apple
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.120]   boot disk that's what you want that's what you know I do you don't actually need a utility
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.760]   that's actually just three four simple steps you can do it all throughout the US excuse me
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.720]   oh throughout the OS super duper would do it right um no because you still have to do
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.880]   a couple there there's basically what comes what comes down to is that when you create
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.520]   the volume you have to initially you have to form format the US the the the key drive
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.160]   as Mac OS you have to basically make sure it has GUID partitioning you also have to go
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.440]   do a get info in the finder and ordinarily the permissions of that volume will be set
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.600]   so that the OS cannot run on it I rather the installer will not recognize it as an installable
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.400]   drive unless you adjust the permissions correctly it were I mean it works I was having as my
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.480]   effect on the Mac many crews I was having a discussion with somebody about how practical
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.440]   this is and his his idea being that well look what if I just take a 16 gigabyte memory
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.080]   card have that have that as my emergency boot disk and just keep it in my wallet and if
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.760]   I get into troubles like on the road or if I'm a friend's house and they can trouble
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:16.400]   I can simply use that to boot off of I'm saying okay so long as you can get get a USB the
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.800]   USB card reader hooked up to it I don't know if you're gonna get that in your wallet too
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.840]   it's it's interesting it's it's it's it's cool it's a cool parlor trick and it might be
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.920]   useful for some people I think carrying around a you know a USB key with your installer I
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.280]   probably will do that for my you know the day that I now get snow leopard and I have
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.560]   to install it on all of these machines right right see I'm I don't qualify for that because
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.640]   I usually travel with an external drive anyway just for like I have a couple of different
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.760]   computers and I usually just image one of my desktops onto that drive so that I can
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.440]   boot off of it if I need to to get access to certain applications and usually simple enough
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.760]   to have a second boot volume or second set of utilities though again if I wanted to
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.320]   spend you can go on to Amazon and buy a 16 gigabyte key drive for something like 22 23
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.720]   bucks so if you worry if you're worried about that that's that's fine I think the other
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.240]   argument that I made is that I can't think of the last time that I had a problem with
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.400]   my problem with starting up my machine that had to do with a boot problem that could easily
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.840]   be solved by booting off of an external volume this the OS is stable enough these days that
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.960]   when I do have that problem it's because it's physically broken or there's something that's
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.400]   beyond the reach of software and then we should mention I guess that there's also that Mac
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:37.280]   Box set that they announced at WWDC which is so if you if you if you don't have leopard
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:44.120]   for 169 bucks you get them on Amazon you get the max box set which has iWork iLife and
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.760]   a full leopard I believe well and that's that's a great deal again that's that's a hardware
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.120]   company that is augmented by software yeah you know that's ended and powered by software
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.320]   and that's what you do when you do that you get aggressive about making sure that it's
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.600]   really cheap to have the great software that makes sure it makes that hardware sing that's
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:05.440]   that's that's you know because I work is 79 bucks iLife is 79 bucks and you get snow leopard
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.680]   for less than the two of them that's that's a hell of a I love IWork by the way I don't
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.280]   know I do I use it to I don't use I haven't we got rid of word yeah we got rid of all
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.440]   them Microsoft Office stuff a while ago I open everything in pages all my word docs
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:22.440]   come and they open fine in pages all my excel for the most part excel spread she's working
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.160]   on formatting issues numbers is an issue sometimes oh I love numbers but I have some
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.160]   formatting issues with pages with word documents you know ones that have like two columns oh
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.840]   okay well that would make sense to be a few things you can't do yeah that evidently is
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.320]   one of them you found the one I got a shooting script from a from a broadcast company and
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.440]   every time I brought into pages it just came in one long crazy thing by the way do not
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:52.760]   jailbreak your iPhone because then the terrorists win terrorists yeah terrorists win according
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:57.960]   to Apple electronic frontier foundation has made a request to the copyright office to
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:04.120]   make a statement saying it's okay to jailbreak your iPhone I'm not talking about unlocking
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.880]   it I'm talking about just jailbreaking it so you can run third party applications on
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.800]   it something that is easy to do is harmless to do but Apple says not only does Apple say
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   it's illegal but in their response to this EFF request Apple explained that jailbreaking
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:29.000]   could allow hackers to DDoS cell towers a local or international hacker could potentially
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   initiate commands that could crash the tower software rendering the tower entirely inoperable
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.720]   to process calls taking control of the baseband processor software would be the equivalent
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.400]   of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer to potentially catastrophic results
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:54.160]   evidently I didn't realize that my iPhone had near nuclear capacity I just didn't know
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.760]   I'd if I had known I would have been more careful in a mass destruction yes yeah Fred
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.920]   von Lohman the EFF attorney said these are preposterous claims he says there are as
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.560]   many as a million unauthorized jailbroken iPhones and so far no one has yet destroyed
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.880]   a mobile phone tower although they've dream dreamt of it so folks not only do the angels
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.320]   cry when you break your iPhone I'm planning to jailbreak my old one are you yeah I'm gonna
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.000]   the only reason is because I want to be able to do screen captures sorry not that I'm bitter
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.960]   but I just want to be able to do good screen captures for my from my iPhone for our iPhone
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.400]   show I know there's no one you can screen capture no I video oh video I want to get the
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.840]   video output of it I want you know I'm you know and you know you can only do it with that
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:49.080]   demo God stuff I know I know please how hard how hard is that anyways and Apple can do
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.040]   it that's what makes me really bitter as I watch them up there doing their little presentations
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.200]   for the thing and they have an application that's doing it and they just won't give you
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:01.480]   another reason to jailbreak it so Alex your philosophy is if they let Steve Jobs do something
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.960]   then you should have the same rights as you're essentially Steve Jobs is what you're saying
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:12.160]   he's like the CHP the CHP can speed a hundred miles an hour he says I want to be able to
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.080]   speed a hundred miles an hour they're allowed so anyway so I'm not I'm not I'm not getting
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.640]   mad I'm getting even well there's another reason that GV the Google voice app not the
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.960]   official one but the third party is available on CD a yeah it's available for jailbroken
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.320]   iPhones yeah we're gonna do it just after right now it's right I'm running it through a survival
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:35.440]   test with my son also Apple says that people who jailbreak could be drug dealers because
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.960]   then you can alter the exclusive chip identification number which could a label call an out able
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.000]   customate be made anonymously so if a drug dealer doesn't want to go out and buy a burner
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.280]   phone he could actually use an iPhone you know I really think they should have they should
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.200]   have not use drug dealer and really should have stuck with terrorists they're the same
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.320]   thing I mean you know well you know I mean drug dealers nowadays I mean I think that I
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.400]   think the presses get people are like eh drug dealer you know we really need to make
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.080]   a silly wire you know you know you know it's like whatever and then but terrorists this
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.840]   still got some for the moment still has a little bit more flair I think terrorists would
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.160]   have been better yeah well see the problem is that terrorists is being used like Hitler
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.960]   these days it's like they just lose their traumatic punch you know that someone is just
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.240]   overreaching just for dramatic effect and who cares about drug dealers a drug addict
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.960]   does we can't find one well there's that there's that you know yeah there you go it
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.720]   is kind of ironic that a company that allows a program called cannabis on its phone that
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.800]   lets you find pot dealers legal pot dealers but fine pot dealers and a lawyer should you
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.280]   get arrested is worried about drug dealers hacking the phone in such a way that they could
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.120]   use it like a burner you know you know what you could really do is a drug dealer you could
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.800]   develop an app for the Google for the development app for the jailbroken phone so that it would
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:58.320]   give away your GPS location I guess I wouldn't be very good what I think so people could find
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.160]   you to buy cannabis from you but not so good I am I'm right here I'm right here I'm walking
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:10.640]   around I got it for me I got a key though next year after they legalize it next year
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.240]   so we're gonna take a break and come back with your picks of the week gentlemen start
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.960]   your thinking caps start finding your your application I've got one that's just I've
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.320]   been using it for the last five days and just I'm so excited it's so good before we do that
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:30.160]   I want to mention our friends at audible.com yeah the great library of online audio books
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:37.200]   that you can download within seconds and have on your iPhone iPod Kindle zoom even many GPS
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.520]   devices the iRiver the Sansa I love listening to audio books if you're listening to a podcast
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.440]   you're already kind of conditioned to listening and I'll tell you in the car at the gym I was
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.680]   listening the gym today I was learning about classical music he said he told me he said
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:59.240]   in this book they said never say you I just listened to box concerto number three in C major
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:06.080]   he said always say we listened I was relistening to box could much more effective when you say
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.000]   I re-listened he said when you when you say I read I read I was reading good no no say I'm
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.040]   re-reading good much much more impressive.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.560]   Oh see your reaction if your first reaction was to slap him and you do and you discarded
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:29.120]   that your second should have been you know I feel as though every time I hear Bach I try
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.880]   to adjust myself as though I'm listening to it for the first time for me it never gets
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.880]   boring or repetitive I don't know about you.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.440]   I'm sorry good well done well done see he's a master of one upmanship these are the kinds
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.680]   of things you learn you see this is the kind of education we've received from our good friends
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:53.120]   at audible.com I invite you to go to audible.com/macbreak that is where you get your first book
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.360]   free you sign up for that the gold account Andy Anaco have you a recommendation today
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.680]   for a book you've been re-reading.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.840]   Actually not a book I've been re-reading but an author that I've been re-reading there
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.600]   is a there it seems as though there was a genre in British writing for a while known
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:20.640]   as the wacky bet or the wacky adventure nonfiction wacky travel adventure book which would start
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.160]   out with chapter one author gets drunk with somebody a chapter two at the end of the chapter
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.000]   a drunken wager is made chapter two the person and the person he made the wager with realizes
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.720]   that there's not they've now tied a lot of their ego with this drunken bet and although
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.400]   neither of them wants to actually do this they now realize that well we're going to have
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.000]   to actually go through this or else I'll look like a total was and then chapters three
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.720]   to twenty two they have to come through with this really stupid weird bet the classic of
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:55.800]   this genre would be are you Dave Gorman by which two friends have day of man names Dave
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.080]   Dave Gorman has to cross the entire planet trying to meet fifty two people also named
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.760]   Dave Gorman and doesn't count unless he shakes their hand and gets a polaroid taken
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.080]   while that's so also in this unfortunate that's not available in audio an audible or else
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.800]   that would have been one of my first picks two years ago because it's such a wonderful
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.000]   book you will you will not believe how you will not believe it's a true story to right
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.200]   it's it's an absolutely true story and the hell let's talk about this book for a minute
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:29.000]   anyway it's a it's co-written between the two people involved Dave Gorman and his friend
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.920]   Danny Wallace and they keep alternating chapters where first Danny Danny Wallace takes a chapter
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:38.560]   then Dave Gorman takes a chapter chapter or I'm sorry rather they pick up the narrative
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:43.400]   like switching it off every few paragraphs to keep seeing this from each person's perspective
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:49.120]   and the the highlight of the book is that point at which you know they're they're in the they're
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.000]   in that they're they're in the bar they're drunk on tequila they've basically challenged
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.160]   oh no there is not there is not a soccer coach in Ireland by the name of Dave Gorman I know
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.760]   that you think there is I know you believe someone who told you but there isn't one and
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.360]   then there's imagine like like a brilliant like eight page scene in which all right well
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.480]   fine I'm gonna go get a cab right now you're good to cab right now but cab arrives and
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.680]   both for that okay well clearly clearly I'm not gonna give the satisfaction what's gonna
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.560]   happen is that I'm gonna get in the cab and then we're gonna go to the train station
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.440]   then he's gonna say okay you're right we're not going to Ireland the next chapter my god
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.960]   he got into the cab I can't back down so we're going we're we so I had to take him into the
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.440]   station we bought the ticket figure that he would say okay we're obviously we're not going
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.960]   to Ireland well damn it he bought the tickets okay well we're gonna get on the train and
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.960]   then he's gonna tell us to get out or then remind me not to get drunk with you Andy and
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.400]   I'll just I see I know I'm that's doubly the good thing because I'm the person who does
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.160]   not get drunk I'm the person who wants to watch other people get drunk and you never
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.520]   and you would never enter a cab knowing that that could end up you could end up in Ireland
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.480]   well exactly Ireland is very I was very pleasant I wouldn't you know not want to go to Ireland
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   wouldn't be the end of the world but this is unfortunately this is all by way of introducing
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.000]   the actual audible book that I'm picking the guy my name of Tony Hawks is also a member
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.920]   part of this genre he create he wrote a book called round Ireland with a fridge in which
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:11.200]   now this this is where I start to wonder if these aren't really just hi Dave can you
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.920]   can you like go to the bar with me and challenge me to walk around Ireland with a refrigerator
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.240]   because I've got an idea of Ireland always figure so I'm large in these stories because
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:27.640]   that's where the whiskey is so so so so so so he wrote this wonderful book about just
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:33.440]   the adventure of he had he had a hitchhike around the entire circumference of of Ireland
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.640]   with a like a dorm fridge and so that's the event that's the eventually he wrote about
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.840]   there he has another book that came much much later this is this is the audible pic basically
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.240]   I bought it because I enjoyed that other book so much it's called a piano in the Pyrenees
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.760]   and I'm thinking that oh so now he has to carry a piano through the Pyrenees no it's
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:59.320]   it's about him like buying a buying a small like little house in rural France and sort
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.720]   of getting adjusted to the idea of being this this London city guy who has to get used to
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.040]   small town ways and also the idea of his friends who are also like drinkers a little
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.200]   bit rowdy getting used to like integrating when they come to visit and that sort of thing
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.200]   there's some books where it's the premise that's incredibly compelling and incredibly
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:21.240]   promising again like some guy has to meet 52 people are all all across word named David
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.200]   Gorman but then there's some people where I just like the guy the way this guy tells
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.880]   a story and so the actual events the actual story is not as important as the way Tony
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.400]   Hawks tells it and he's he's a really wonderful storyteller so I'm only about couple chapters
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:40.040]   I'm this is a nine hour 21 minute unembraged book I'm about maybe 45 minutes to an hour
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.800]   into it and already it's just it's like reading a really cool blog about someone who's making
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.440]   some changes in his life that he's maybe coming to regret which is always the best best thing
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:54.720]   to read as safe and sound and at home with a nice cup of nice cup of tea and and something
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.040]   else at your shoulder yeah I like the idea of a of an adventure that you don't have to
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:03.160]   leave the house for exactly a piano in the Pyrenees the ups and downs of an Englishman
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:11.040]   in the French mountains no pianos were involved in the at least not carried around the Pyrenees
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:18.400]   but this sounds good by Tony Hawks HAWKS now the point of this whole exercise here is

[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.280]   of this fellow I've never I don't even really know the genre you're speaking of I see I
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:55.880]   don't think there's an actual section for it on Amazon dot com dot uk it's just I read
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.640]   R.U. Dave Gorman and then I wrote then I read Dave Gorman's Google whack adventure
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:04.520]   and then his friend is by the way on audible you the Google whack adventure oh it is yeah
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.120]   well there you go that's my paper next week then you just say my social time and then
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.480]   then then Danny Wallace started writing his own books he did it as matter of fact one
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.360]   of his books got turned into a movie where you decide to spend an entire year saying
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.160]   yes to everything and became a movie. Oh that's the estimate yeah right and so again another
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.760]   one of those things from wondering okay no Danny Danny no no I believe you I believe
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.800]   you when you say that you came up with this idea spontaneously and I don't know I also
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.360]   believe you I want to believe you when you say that you did all the things in this book
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.480]   I'm saying that it's it's an intended to entertaining book and that's all I wanted out of it Danny
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.360]   so let's let's not discuss whether or not you really did every time like you were offered
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.120]   a credit card or a load. Yes I signed up that load. Yes. Let's not even get into that. Let's
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.600]   just say it wasn't really just imagine what would what life would be like if you said
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.280]   yes to everything. Yes. I want to try saying no to everything for a year. Yeah exactly.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.760]   That's going to that would be a hard thing for me to do but I'd like to do. I like to
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.880]   say no often. Screw you learning. Yes. Screw you. I'm just going to say screw you to everything.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:14.120]   Would you like to supersize that for 39 cents more? Scroll you. Alright sure. Seven dollars
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   everybody says please pull up. I like that idea. Hey let's get to our picks of the week.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:28.240]   Mr. Alex Lindsay you can begin our pickathon if you will. So I have not as much a pick but
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.560]   a discussion. A discussion. Discussion of of headsets for my iPhone. I've been I've been
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.120]   talking about what the requirements were on Twitter. I'll tell you what I use in love
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.480]   but go ahead. Okay and and so I've got a couple of them now that I've been now people
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.240]   have been asking me what do I use after all those discussions. So the one that I probably
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.200]   use the most is this this is the ultimate ears but it's the it's the iPhone version
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.720]   so that you can actually change. That's a fun microphone. You know the ultimate ears
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.960]   don't come with these little these little ear things. They come with I don't like the
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:02.320]   ultimate ears insert. So what I do is I buy the sure flange the sure flanges and then
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.720]   I force them over the ultimate ear ones and they work great. So anyway that's what I
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.160]   use most because you know I can listen what I love is the fact that I'm listening to music
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.800]   it's really good sound and when someone calls I can you know it goes away. Problem with that
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.360]   one is is that the audio can be you know from the little microphone here is just okay and
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.720]   I kind of wanted to have a Bluetooth version and so I put it up there and people actually
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.600]   sent this in on Twitter and this is the Edomotic. Yeah I have that. This is the Bluetooth.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.000]   I have a different Bluetooth one. So it's in ear. Yeah. Bluetooth now it'll work like
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.680]   this. Oh that's cool. But it also has a and this is what I wanted this is one of my requirements.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:44.080]   That's neat. So now it has a little bendy boom. Let me give it to me. I'll show them a close
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.360]   up while you're talking about it. It's got a little bendy boom. So this this is
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.800]   and it's like a standard Bluetooth little small Bluetooth thing on your ear. It's got the
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.440]   and it has the Edomotix. Is the audio quality like Edomotix? The audio quality is very high.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.600]   But it's not stereo. It's not a 2D piece. It's not stereo. This is really for I'm talking on the phone.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.080]   Right. But then this is an optional boom. Yeah. You can pull the boom out and use it without the
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.920]   boom. It's got two different mics. So you can use it without the boom or with the boom.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.960]   It is Bluetooth. Here's the thing is it has the same problem that I think every Bluetooth that I've
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:18.640]   ever used has which is that you get a little clicking here and there. You know if you get too
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.360]   close to stuff. I don't like Bluetooth. If I have it in my front shirt pocket when I'm driving it
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.520]   works great. You know when I'm you know when I'm at the house if I put it in my gene phone.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.480]   The not the earpiece. The earpiece. I'm saying no that you don't put the earpiece in your pocket.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.800]   You put the phone in your pocket. When the phone's in my pocket. But when it gets further away than
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.720]   that I have to say that when I'm in ear a lot of metal or I'm the ear a lot of things I can hear
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.440]   a little bit of clicking going on. So I got this is the other one that I got as a test. We're testing
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.200]   these for the company right now. So I'm this is the other etymotix. That's what I use. This is the
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.720]   wired version. Love it. You have this is the one you have. I use the wired etymotix. Now did you
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   have to get the little so you got the little adapter for it? No it came it's for the iPhone. It came
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.240]   with the appropriate. You didn't see that. Well it didn't come with it. So it's not two and a half.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.960]   It fits in the three GS. I don't end the three. I know that. And it's 100. It's expensive. It's
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.920]   179 bucks. But it's wired. But it's wired. It has a microphone. Well this one's 39. So it was a
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.960]   lot cheaper. Oh I don't know. That's just for Bluetooth audio. That's just for a single ear.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   I'm talking I use etymotix headphones. Is there a boom? Is it a boom? No. It just has
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:28.000]   a hand. You don't need the boom. I'm big in the boom. No. It's right here. Well I should go get
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.920]   it. It's right here. It's closer to your mouth than a boom would be. It's like your Adam's apple.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:42.000]   See the boom? Boom right there. Okay so that what you got there is a lot cheaper. But it's not for
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.480]   listening stereo music. It's just for the phone. This is for when I'm having meetings or whatever.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:50.640]   If I'm gonna if I'm gonna do that I use the the I just wear my etymotix headphones all the time
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.480]   because they have a microphone and that's what he wants to make a call to me. I press pick up
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.840]   and then I can talk about it. And that's what these have. Yeah. You know but but I find that the
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.560]   audio quality is much higher with the boom. Really? Yeah. Less less surround stuff. People
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.600]   complain less about being able to hear me when I get bad wind noise on the other style. Oh and
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.200]   these come with little um has a Vinschutz. Yeah it's got the little uh little puff. Little puff daddy.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.520]   Okay I might have to get that then. It's kind of nice. I like the idea though of my
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.920]   iPhone headphones. Well and that's doing double duty. So this is just a replacement for the
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.960]   iPhone pod. That's what I use. And that's what you have the ultimate years for. And this is what
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.800]   I use day and day out. But when I'm having meetings I see. You know and I really want people to hear
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.640]   me or for working on something and I really you know you think it sounds that much better.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.800]   Yeah. People have told me that it sounds much much better. We should do some recordings.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.920]   Yes we should. And then we can compare. Yes. I've been very happy with the quality of the etymotix.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.880]   Yeah. But those are very pricey there. How does 79. Well this yeah this the Bluetooth one is about
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:53.360]   129. And then this is this one is cheap 39. This was cheap. And you get this great in ear. Because
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.840]   the one thing is is that I had to have something that goes in half the flange. Um yeah this is in
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.600]   ear modeler. Yeah. And um and the thing I will not I do not get headphones without three flanges.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.760]   That's all I'm saying. You know not one not two it has to have three flanges.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.520]   If it doesn't make you gag when you insert it it's really not doing its job. After all I get used to
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:19.200]   it. Thanks me gag. But you're right you get used to it. Yeah. So you don't really have a
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.720]   recommendation you that was a survey more. It's more of a survey of the of the stuff we're going
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.240]   through. But they're definitely worth looking at it. The big thing that was is that I was excited
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:32.240]   to find I guess more of the recommendation is great in ear with boom. My requirement was
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.920]   had to be in here with flanged in ear. But it's not and have a boom. It's mon I don't care about that.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.440]   You know all I cared about was that I really wanted something good for meetings where I
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.320]   get a boom where I'm going to get the best audio quality I can get. And I'm going to have a um
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.040]   you know a flanged in ear where I can really hear what the person's talking about and I don't
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.600]   have to force it. I don't have to because I find that a lot of times I get my hand evidently over
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.320]   the mic you know here when I'm talking. And so just holding my iPhone up I've kind of given up on
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.160]   and in California one of the reasons I really got into this is of course in California it's illegal
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:08.880]   to have your iPhone be holding your iPhone while you're talking. Although we've now found out
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.560]   that it's 20 you're 23 times more likely to die even if you have a hands-free unit when you're
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:23.360]   talking on the phone. So just stop. Well 23 times more likely to die. Wow. I know you're talking
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.520]   to someone who doesn't even turn the phone off on the plane. Yeah I know I can do it. I'm the
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.800]   I'm like the pilot I know I know. But what how many times if you're talking on the phone and eating
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:45.200]   sunflower seeds that's going to kill you. So I I will recommend what I would I use which is the
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:52.880]   HF2 those are the edomodix 179 bucks high phone headphones slash microphone but you think from the
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:00.640]   same company and I don't know what they call it. It's E. T. Y. M. O. T. I. C. edomotic.com
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:06.000]   you you like the one with the boom. I like I like the boom. What is that called? And there's two
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.560]   of them. There's one with that's wired and one with Bluetooth and I like them both for different
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.960]   reasons. But I like the boom. I'm a big in ear and boom or the two requirements for me. And there's
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:22.000]   only like you know there's another company that makes them but the the little I do find that this
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.720]   little head this little this is optional this little this little earpiece but without it it
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.640]   just feels like it's going to fall off. But when you get this thing tightened and it's it's a very
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.960]   really incredible engineering design because you can just kind of push it in and out. When you get
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.080]   it tightened it just feels like it's part of your head. I know there's a joke here somewhere something
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.840]   about boom goes the edomotic something like that but I can't one and my my brother just made the
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.720]   one requirement when I got the Bluetooth you're not going to walk around the office with that
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:52.480]   when you're not on the phone. Do not do it. That's like so boom goes a dynamite. Boom.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   All right I'm going to make my recommendation then we'll let you do yours Andy in Otco and this
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:04.080]   this is something that a doctor mom in our chat room told me about and it turns out I'm just way
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.040]   behind because this has been out for a long time although new versions have come out and proving
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.040]   it over and over again. It's a to-do list for the iPhone you know I've been using remember the milk
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.920]   or and I like remember the milk and the application's great you have to pay for a pro account remember
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:22.400]   the milk but you know it gets the job done syncs with the web you can add to the on the web you can
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.440]   add on your desktop you can do it on the iPhone and and then for a long time they remember jot
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.120]   jot t where you'd you could call up jot and you could you could call jot and you could give it
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.400]   to-do list items and then it would send it to remember the milk which would send it to your
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:45.840]   iPhone. Well here's a company called Recall r-e-q-a-l-l.com they make a blackberry version they make an
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:52.640]   iPhone version and there is a web-based version but this combines the best in my mind of jot
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.960]   and remember the milk I can press a button and speak into the iPhone we've not even making a call I
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:10.160]   can tap the iPhone and say remind me to call Alex on Thursday it then saves it transcribes it I
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.360]   think it's being almost positive it's being transcribed by a human unlike jot because you know
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.440]   there's punctuation and it seems to understand quite a bit it'll take a little while to get that
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.640]   in there it also notices that I said Thursday it will add it to my Google calendar automatically
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:30.160]   for Thursday if you put a date or time in there if you use some special words like at work or at
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.760]   home it assigns it to that location and uses the iPhone's location ability to tell you so there's a
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:39.600]   little front page that says oh I see you're at work now these are some of the things you said you
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:46.960]   needed to do at work it will it will also interpret things like share so I can share with other people
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.320]   on my contact list I can send them to do lists it has a number of words it understands actually
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.120]   and fortunately when you press the add button it gives you a few of those it understands meet
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:03.040]   it understands so I could say meet with Alex how about flamingo doesn't understand that kind of
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:10.560]   meat you can add notes so you can have a reminder or a note and it will remind you via SMS or email
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:17.280]   it has a variety of choices it's a very flexible really powerful to do list manager you can also
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:23.440]   phone it it has a phone number just like jot did so I can call recall it's on my I have it on my
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.800]   quick dial list as a web service it's web based so this the syncing is done over the web it's for
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:35.200]   the iPhones it's our EQ a l l dot com it's 30 bucks for a pro account per year but you get most of
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.240]   these features for free you don't have to get the pro account but if you call recall you can also
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.120]   send many it says many of the same things to it over the phone and it has an I am client a jabber
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.240]   based I think it's a google talk based actually I am client so you can have it open and I am so
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:58.560]   I like on a to-do list lots of ways to get stuff into the to-do list and this you know gives me the
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.680]   best way of all which is to merely tell my phone hey don't forget this remind me to do this the
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.000]   transcriptions excellent because as I said I think it's mechanical sturk turk style it's done by a
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.680]   a human it has location based capabilities so you can say you know here's here's where I am and
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:22.480]   it'll tell you what you can do at that location it has sharing with people it it has some interesting
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   features called memory jogger and memory boost that I really don't quite understand periodically
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.080]   it'll text me and say hey don't forget you were going to call the dentist things like that
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:39.280]   I'm really impressed with this thing the application is free the service is free r-e-q-a-l-l.com but
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.080]   I paid the 30 bucks a year to get the pro version because it adds a few additional features
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.560]   so this is you know I have a terrible time remembering what to do bought it
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:54.880]   I have a terrible time remembering what to do and this is the first to-do list that's really
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.400]   integrated nicely did you look at the website I'm I'm signing up yeah it's it's really cool I've
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.320]   been very pleased with how effective it is you know I just love the idea that I can pull out
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.960]   it's that old note to self chocolate pizza it's that old idea of that you have the little
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.960]   memo recorder and you don't forget things but this is so much better because it's being
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.640]   transcribed it's being put on the web it's being synced with your phone it's being the Google
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.880]   calendar integration is really nice you can you know somebody says you need to make an appointment
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:30.720]   you just say December 3rd 2 a.m. don't forget to get up and watch you know sunny and share
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   and it will and it will remind you to do that it can even put off an alarm on your phone so
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.600]   that's a very nice feature we'll put into your iCal it does it you can subscribe to it in iCal
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.680]   it has google calendar I use google calendar but yeah you could subscribe to it in iCal as well
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.400]   all right I'm you know I love it I already downloaded it I'm just getting excited yeah I think
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.400]   I'm going pro let me know yeah well you know you get the pro account for free for two weeks see if
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.200]   you see if you like it but you know what I thought and they don't start billing you after the two
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.160]   weeks are up I thought oh I'm gonna be good this time I'm not gonna buy it right away one day later
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.400]   I'm saying yeah this is it I bought it it uses voice email instant messaging text messaging
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:13.840]   uses your phone works on blackberry as well as iphone which is a nice feature very impressive
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:22.240]   to do list manager r E Q A L L dot com and on the iPhone it's uh it's it's the it's r E Q A L L the
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:29.040]   iPhone app that's my pick and now ladies gentle but it's time for mr and a dot co at his pick of
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.320]   the week okay well thank you very much you've been a five-plus for fabulous vlogs we'll have
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:40.960]   another big hand for oxlings leave yeah have you had you heard of recall and ears I have I do not
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.560]   recall uh it's my fact I have well I'm not see this this is the difference between the
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.880]   financial status of Alex and myself Alex went and bought it I just wrote down like recall
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.880]   my book that here that's something that I should probably I still use ever know and I still use
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:58.720]   all those other things but this is like the you know get it in there quickly thing well it's
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.160]   probably see that's probably that's probably another statement that I'm making about like it I
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.480]   have my iPhone right here but did I make a note like in any the any information managers know
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.320]   I just wrote it down on a scrap of paper that I have here on my desk um speaking of paper
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.760]   and how we should be eliminating it and all possible ebooks are going to be huge next year we
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:22.560]   are poised to basically see this for the first year when it's going to stop being a freak uh sort
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.160]   of way of reading things and it's going to be really part of the mainstream we we spent so much
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.960]   time earlier talking about uh what uh what uh the uh the apple tap was going to do and also all
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.920]   these other companies are coming out with tablet like computers so chiefly as ebook readers so I'm
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.640]   actually for the past two or three months I've been sort of in the process of learning more about
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.840]   building ebooks both things uh I write that I want to publish as ebooks but also as taking some of
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.680]   those favorite books that you have that you read over and over and over again because you love them
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.560]   so much and converting them into any book format now it's not good enough uh that the tools that
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.880]   are that exist right now for converting paper text into an ebook aren't good enough that you wouldn't
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.880]   that you would just do it like ripping ripping a CD they're still uh it's still uh complicated and
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.960]   fussy enough that you would only do it for again those books that you that are out of print that you
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.320]   can't buy uh at on amazon or any other format uh that you have to basically convert yourself
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.320]   uh but I'm glad to see this they're finally starting to be some tools for building books
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:25.200]   themselves uh and so just two days ago what I think the the very first wizzy wig ebook creator
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.560]   and ebook editor was released on google code it's called sigil s-i-g-i-l and but it looks now it
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:38.240]   it's deceptive now there's only version point one so it's not hugely feature-riffic but what it does
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.080]   is what an e-book editor needs to do it allows you to open a text file an html file or or
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.200]   uh or uh not a text file or an html file and it will allow you to open it and edit it
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.800]   using all the markup terms of the e-pub format which I think is going to be the the html of
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.240]   electronic books it's a very very simple format it looks very very simple to html it's an xml based
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.200]   data structure so it's extensible it's very very visible and it's very very easy to mess around
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.440]   with the difference is that uh there's uh I'm sure that a lot of people listening have been
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.040]   converting stuff into iphone books using stanza uh the desktop version will read almost any file
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.000]   that has text in it and turn it into something that the the iphone stanza reader can deal with
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.400]   the problem is that you're sort of stuck with whatever formatting and whatever structure
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.720]   stanza decides to impose upon it whereas sigil will let you make all the decisions if you want to
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.760]   have a nice title page with that that's an a graphical sort of different font you can do that
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.680]   if you want to insert tables of contents if you want to insert section breaks if you want
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.840]   images to be to the left to the right to the middle you can do that the difference is that you can
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.360]   build this e-book not as just sort of uh okay that's interesting I can actually read this book on my
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.280]   Kindle and my iphone that doesn't really work that well but I can read that book and still have an
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.680]   experience you can take long text and turn them into real polish professional looking e-pub books
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.600]   that will look great on your Kindle it will look great on your iphone and it will look great even
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.120]   if you just format it that way and then open it and stanza and then save it into another e-book
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:14.160]   format now again this is version point one it is free but it is a version point one one of the
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:20.000]   things that I'm hoping that point one point one uh offers is uh rtf format because when you're
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.560]   using uh ocr applications the easiest program to use the easiest format to use to retain
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.000]   interesting formatting like italics and and differences and font sizes is rtf the way to use it for
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.560]   now is to export it as html and you'll get uh and you'll get close to what you what you want
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:41.840]   finally uh but the idea is that once again you can produce a very very slick e-book that has
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.920]   just about every feature that you would have if you purchase this through the app store or if you
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.560]   purchase this through the Kindle book store and then you just put it on your phone and then it just
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:55.040]   becomes an e-pub format file and your phone rate that or do you what do you use to read it on the
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:01.920]   phone uh stanza is is one of the stanza uses e-pub not only that but it's such a simple
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.160]   flexible format that if you're using an application that converts books to other formats
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.800]   it will be able to take all the formatting and every single thing that all the features of this
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.240]   e-pub book that you created in sigil and transmogrified interest destination for instance stanza will
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:22.960]   also transmogrify e-pub books into Kindle book format so it's so not so as when I convert a book
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.400]   using using e-pub I did my first one with sigil yesterday and so what you do is you wind I wind
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.440]   up burning two copies of it in an e-pub format which is the which is probably going to be the most
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:39.360]   universal format no matter what device that you hold in your hand that has a screen and a touch
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.680]   and a touch screen will probably be able to read an e-pub e-pub book and that's probably the format
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.840]   you're going to want but then when I want to actually also be able to read it on my Kindle I'll
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.960]   use stanza to convert it into a Kindle book and then the Kindle book will have all the formatting all
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.080]   the fancy fonts everything that I put into the original e-pub format I expect really great things
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.720]   out of sigil the version point one is again not of not filled with every feature that I would want
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:08.240]   but it has those core 75 percent of the list of features that you would want in an e-pub form
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:14.800]   e-pub editor and the fact the matter is it's the first really good solution that's out there and
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   again I can't wait till I hope they keep building upon this I hope they keep improving it and I
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.760]   hope it becomes sort of like the the CD ripper that we have for music that will sigil will be the
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.680]   thing we use to take documents we have on our desktop and prepare them for electronic publishing
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:31.600]   can you see it publishing your own books this way oh absolutely as a matter of fact that's
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.760]   something that I I'm probably going to be doing sometime in the next two or three months I have a
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:42.080]   collection of short fiction that I'm using as my text as my test bed on how can I publish this how
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.200]   can I make this look good for the reader also how can I make money off of this as opposed to simply
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:55.280]   giving everything away and that is I'm almost certain that by 2010 I will be still publishing
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.560]   most of my textbooks through traditional publishers but for those projects where I don't want to have
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.800]   to spend two months convincing somebody that a collection of fiction by Andy Nocko is something
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.000]   that you should be putting tens of thousands of dollars into Mr. Publisher because we will make
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.480]   a profit off of it I promise please please make me think that I'll sell enough these to cover your
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:17.200]   costs but again for those interesting little ideas I just want to put it up there and even if I just
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.840]   sell if I sell 80 books that's great if I sell a thousand books even better but that's where
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.440]   publishing is going and so yes you will be seeing me publishing books and I think sigil is going to
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.000]   be probably part almost certainly going to be part of my workflow when I start selling the stuff
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:38.640]   I have to take a look at it that's cool very interesting it's sigil.co.google.com/gil.com/gil.com
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.480]   basically go to code.google.com look for sigil and it'll take you right to the download page
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:49.520]   and the other cool thing is that it's available for Mac and Windows so it really has the possibility
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:54.480]   to become one of those exactly one of those it's the program that people are going to rally behind
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.280]   and use because for now it's the only solution like this out there and the fact that we can
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.920]   contribute to one code base that makes a great tool that everybody can use could really be one
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:09.040]   of those five or six factors that the ePub format needs to become the standard for
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.840]   electronic publishing. Well thank you Andy. I'm a huge fan of ePub. Yeah yeah no that's exciting
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:19.760]   that's really exciting. I'll look into the future. Ladies and gentlemen we have concluded this
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.200]   episode of Mac Break Weekly. I thank our friend Andy Inaco. He is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:32.720]   Also his own website is cwob.com somebody in the chair and said I went to cwop.com
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:38.320]   and it's it's there's nothing there it's for sale. No it's B as in as in somebody's in the
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:46.800]   chair B as in television. C w o B because the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:53.360]   I stand by that title. Yes yes you can't go wrong with a celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.720]   If you go to pixelcore.com you'll find Alex Lindsey's wonderful
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:05.200]   Guild of 3D and 2D Artisans graphic designers and more and pixelcore.tv is the place to go for
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:11.280]   us podcasts. We have a ton of new Mac Break studios coming out that are all based on the new Final Cut
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.520]   Studio. So gosh I got to watch that. Yeah yeah so we're talking about all the new features we brought
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:20.640]   in the guys who have been building the training for it and and been working with it you know deeply
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:26.000]   and so they're really really really great stuff. So definitely check that out. I think the first
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.640]   one comes out this week. Very good and of course you can watch this show we produce at live at 2 p.m.
