[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and our dear friend,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   the late departed Alex Lindsey, would have loved to have been part of this show.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I don't know what that means. He's not dead.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh, he's just gone.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Gone but not forgotten. He'll be back next week.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Talk to a Hooters Girl.com.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Which is going to be coming soon to a Hooters Bar near you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   He has a concept for this show that I don't think we'll ever use.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   But we do want to say that we're feeling a little constrained by the clean tag.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So we're going to remove the clean tag and let our freak flag fly,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   so to speak, speaking of which, being a freak flags.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yes, you knew. It was Merlin Man.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hey, Merlin!
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Ladyflies.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I'm going to pull out all my best red fox now.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We're going to go into the red fox all the time on Mac Break.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Also, one of our -- you know, it's funny.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I don't think I've ever done a show with John Foster, except for their live one at Mac World,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   because he's usually the guy who fills in for me, but I'm so glad we could get together.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   He's filling in for Alex Lindsey today.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   John Foster, how are you?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Very good. Nice to be here, everybody.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Ah, he's sounding so clean and crisp and beautiful.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And speaking of beautiful, the man in the hat, the world's --
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   the last actually man in the world to be wearing mutton chub.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Whiskers Mr. Andy and Notko from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Hey, Andy.

[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thank you.

[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, I love this -- we had this little pre-show conversation.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   We're just going to go light blue, and I thought to myself.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Light blue.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It started blue already.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   New stories.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Well, I woke up this morning, and that's a news story in itself, but iTunes 7.1 was waiting
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   for me on my hard drive.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Anybody -- I haven't installed it yet.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Is this just another one of those updates to fix a hole in the DRM, or is there more?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   No.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's mostly a colorful one that's basically to support Apple TV.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Plus, that feature you don't use a flipping through albums.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Cover-fully.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You can now use it full screen.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You can now not use it full screen.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You can.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yes, you can.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If you don't use it --
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   All right, excuse me, exactly.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You can now not use it in a full screen mode.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's only four in the afternoon in the East Coast.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I've only been up for like three hours.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Go easy on me.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I've only had four coats and not really caffeinated yet.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Get your coffee.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So, Scott, you've been using it, and I like cover flow, but you're right.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It isn't the best way to browse your music.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's pretty.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's all.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   No, but it is pretty, and I use it all the time.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   But what was really exciting to me, because I've really been enjoying the Apple games on
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   my iPod, is there's all sorts of little hidden text links in there, which lead us to believe
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   that when the Apple TV finally shipped sometime around Vista 2.0, we're going to actually be
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   able to do games on Apple TV.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You're sounding a little bitter about the slippage.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   They said March 15th, right?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It should be out any day now.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yes, well, you know what?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I want them to get all that out of their system because the iPhone by God is going to ship
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   on time.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You're beyond time.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.840]   John Foster is our resident hacker.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.000]   Have you looked into the resource fork yet of iTunes 7.1?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   No, just downloaded it just prior to being on the show, and I thought I might have a bit
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.760]   of time to look, but I did have the stuff in front of me.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.000]   I opened it and it was like, "Huh, it's iTunes."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Right.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.840]   So, what are you looking at, Andy?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.520]   I say, I'm on Appleinsider.com because that's where I found the strings.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.000]   It has wonderful things like, "Are you sure?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You want to sync games, all existing games on the Apple TV?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Will be replaced with games from this excellent library?"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I could finally play Bejeweled on my Apple TV.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   What is it?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Has anybody, I have Bejeweled on my iPod.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That's the only one I spent the money on to download.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   They're not that expensive, but it's hard with the click wheel.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Are there any great games for the iPod?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Hold them.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Texas, hold them.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Really?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Oh, God.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It is great.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's a wonderful game.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.840]   Oh, it's a wonderful game, but you want to be the nth person of our generation to play
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.000]   Texas, hold them, who after just singing on TV, or you're a real--
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.360]   I'm waiting for baseball to make a real recurrence.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   You know, I think more--
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   It's a little different generation.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.280]   So, Andy, I've been playing poker longer than you've been alive.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   Really?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.920]   Are you-- and have you been playing hold them all that time, Scott?
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   I've been playing hold them since I was four.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   Really?
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.440]   No, no, we're talking about a card game.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   I believe your elementary school switched to a credit system.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720]   You won up there with 75 cents.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.840]   I've been speaking in hyperbulous since I was two.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   I've got Sudoku, and I never play it.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   It's the inner space.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   That's a terrible idea that I don't know why I bought it.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.520]   I don't know how I ever thought a click wheel and a do button would be fun.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   That's the problem.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   I love Sudoku.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   Well, you know what's good?
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520]   It's good for that is paper.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   Yeah, but I mean, even on my trio, I got three different versions for the trio.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.400]   I mean, it's like pulling teeth.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   You've got to be able to write little numbers.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.560]   And it actually works well.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   Which doesn't be perfect.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   Hang man.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   Hang man.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.080]   Because they don't use the scroll wheel.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.000]   You can just tap up, down, left, right.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.200]   Because it has the world's simplest user interface.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   Right, I love that patterns work.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.120]   If they could use two iPods and you could play Robotron.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.480]   Did you say the patterns still work, Andy?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.200]   Yes, the patterns that I learned in junior high school still work.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.480]   Now that's important to know.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   That's valuable information.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   Exactly.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   I dropped a lot of quarters into Pac-Man, but I never got any patterns.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.760]   I must have been the white Russians I was drinking at the same time.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   I kept the patterns out.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   Please, Mr. Lepore, keep your drink off of the game.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.400]   It helps if you're not trying to pick up bowling alley blue women while you're playing.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   Bowling alley.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   Did you play the cocktail?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   The cocktail version?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   Yeah, the table version.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Nice.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   You got your white Russian right there.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   Your joystick in your right hand, your white Russian in your left.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.880]   You're really, it's kind of made for that.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.120]   Sounds like a lot of Scots weekends.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   White Russian joystick in your hand.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   I don't know.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.200]   The young lady sitting on the table.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   For me, it was Tempest.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.200]   Tempest took a lot of money.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.360]   Tempest and Defender later Stargate.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.200]   Those are the games that really took off.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.520]   I think it's funny.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   You could always tell, at least I could always tell, what age cohort.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.200]   Within a couple of years, anybody was from what TV shows they still love.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   Brady Bunch 30s.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.800]   I mean, they just was obvious, right?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.640]   And now I think you probably could do that with arcade games.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.800]   For instance, I've figured out all the patterns in battle zone.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.440]   Do you guys ever play battle zone?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.680]   Oh, yeah, the tank game, the Atari tank game.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   That was an awesome game.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   Wasn't that fun?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   And Red Baron.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680]   Oh, the other one.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   Remember with the planes?
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.360]   Yeah, but battle zone was vector graphics.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.320]   So it wasn't pretty, you know.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   And that will see that.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   Those games were great.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   And I even asked for rights.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.840]   I mean, it was such a perfect use of the available technology.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   You know, they...
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   Is that Space Invaders?
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   I don't know what it is.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   There you go.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   You're exactly right.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:19.680]   There's a generation who, like, all their cultural touchstones from childhood are based
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   on movies.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.720]   They're the generation that's all based on cars, all based on music.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.360]   For like, now there's a whole generation that's all based on video games, which is
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   why MAME was like such a huge impact on at least my life.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   And the first anyhow.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.160]   Oh my God, they've got Tapper.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.000]   Not even like the Mountain Dew version, but the actual Budweiser version.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.440]   Because I used to play Tapper like every single day.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.720]   Never occurring to me that, my God, Budweiser is putting their logo in front of an 11-year-old
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   kid.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   And I'm paying for the privilege.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   Something is evil about this.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   You don't want to give Mountain Dew to 11-years-olds either.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.320]   Frankly, I'd rather give him Bud.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   Have you seen the results of that?
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   No.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   No.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   You pay it play faster.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   Diabetes.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   Type 2.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   So, and a caffeine addiction that just won't quit.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   You know what I say?
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   It's actually a sponsored by the pleasure.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960]   It's actually a sponsored by the pleasure.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.560]   As I listen to this conversation, it just marvels me that any of us have ever actually been
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   able to date.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   Who's dating?
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   Yes, I've been dating lots of the women's.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   You know, at any point in time in our life.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.200]   I believe early because I've got three of them lined up outside.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.640]   The fact that we were able to actually date a woman at any point in time of our life is
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   a freaking miracle.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.080]   Is my wife actually listened to anything I ever did?
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.840]   I never have a chance.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.240]   The good news is this isn't really a magster, but Commodore is back and they're going to
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.720]   be making gaming machines.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   No way.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   Well, somebody bought the name.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   I doubt it's the actual Commodore.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.320]   No, they got some engineers who are really, really hot about that.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.200]   There's a, you know how popular those joysticks with integrated like game.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   Yes, they're huge.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   That's awesome.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.840]   They produce one for the Commodore 64 and the team of engineers that produce it were
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   such fans that there is actually a Commodore 64 full emulation mode that apparently you
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.600]   can essentially, you can like clip one diode and you will get a Commodore 64 prompt and
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.200]   you can load binary files.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   Really?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Wow.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   It becomes a full Commodore 64 computer.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   You can attach devices to it.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   But it's actually ironically my Mac software pick this week is going to be an Atari emulator.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.560]   Atari 400, 800 and I guess it's an FX emulator.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   That's just great.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   Those are the good old days.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   I love those.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.480]   Did you see the Lisa emulator that was floating around?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.800]   Oh, that's what I want.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   I could never afford it.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   We have to at least in my time, but.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.200]   I don't like enter a year between 1983 and 1995.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.320]   I just caught this on on the ultimate Apple web lock this week, but it's so, and there's
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   something really kind of refreshing about a computer that says, man, you're not going
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.120]   to need this after a few years.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   95.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120]   We're gone.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   We're history.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.920]   I'm not going to blow a couple spots for that.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   95.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   It wasn't.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   It was 10 grand that computer.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   $10,000.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.000]   I knew someone who had one of those and it was it looked almost like a K-Pro, right?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.640]   It had kind of had that kind of weird form.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.480]   It was like a tall K-Pro because it had a bigger screen.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   It had sort of didn't have it.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.000]   It didn't have a handle.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.320]   It didn't have a handle on it.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.720]   You wouldn't carry it around.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   No.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   There were some bad design decisions.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.920]   For instance, the Twiggy Drive that it used, the you know how these floppy disks would have
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.800]   an opening where you the readhead would be.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.960]   It was right where you put your thumb as you inserted the floppy.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   Not a good design.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   Right.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.560]   As a matter of fact, the Apple shareholders successfully sued Apple largely about the
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.600]   Lisa fiasco chiefly because they kept saying that the Twiggy Drive's worked when actually
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   not quite so much.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.520]   Not at all, depending on where you put your thumb.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.920]   Well, the original Mac.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   They're decorative.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.400]   The original Mac 128, if you look at the metal and the case, it was designed for a Twiggy
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   Drive.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Oh, interesting.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   I actually saw a picture of a Twiggy Drive prototype Mac.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   Thank God.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   I didn't put that in there.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.040]   Fortunately, they got wise and said three and a half is the way to go.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   Well you actually made the point earlier, John, in our email exchange that this is the 20th
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.120]   anniversary of the Mac 2 and the Mac SC and you make the very excellent point is that they
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.320]   were the first real, well the Mac 2 really was the first real Mac.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   This is where the Mac got really interesting because A, there were slots.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.520]   You didn't have to unsaughter ram sticks to make it work.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.480]   You could put large screens on and there was 256 colors that you could play with in the
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   video card.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.880]   It was a big deal.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.080]   My first one was an SE.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.560]   SE with two 800k floppies was my first note.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   No hard drive.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   No hard drive in it.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560]   That was the big deal.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.120]   Oh my gosh, you grabbed one of those Jasmine backpacks.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   That's one of those 10 or 20 make Jasmine backpacks and you're good to go.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   He's saying, kids, he's saying, Meg, not gig Meg.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.600]   Meg, it's smaller than your thumb drive is what he's saying.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.840]   The SE was a really cool computer because back in the day when I was selling computers
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.000]   through a computer store, we would buy the SEs with two flops, take the second flop out
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.440]   and put a hard drive in in its place.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.840]   And we would save the customer five or six hundred bucks on buying a SE with the hard
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   drive in it.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.920]   People still buy an apple with no ram and they put their own ram in because apple was
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.800]   still over charges for components.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.000]   Basically, buy the smallest thing that you can get away with that has the fastest CPU
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.760]   and then build it up from there.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.560]   I paid 800 bucks for my five megabyte hard disk for my SE.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   Geez.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.720]   I'm sitting in front of the two FX motherboard.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.880]   I have it framed hanging on the wall because the two FX frankly stand for two frickin'
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   expensive.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.720]   Well, that was their big, that was the big graphics.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   Like if you're a desktop publishing graphics person, that was THE machine to have back then.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.920]   Yeah, and it was super fast.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   What was it?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   20 megahertz?
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   I don't remember.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   It was, ooh, this thing.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.080]   I don't know if I'll ever be able to max this sucker out.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   Do you guys remember that?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.920]   Actually, I'll bet almost all of you guys remember this.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.480]   Do you remember that famous article in the whatever January '85 issue of Macworld or
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480]   Macuser?
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   It said, "Well, you know the Apple 10 megabyte hard drive is steep at its $1,000 price,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.200]   but we're confident this will probably be all this storage space that you'll have in
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   me."
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Yeah, 10 meg.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   You wouldn't...
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   You were $1,000.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.280]   You could get a free thumb drive in a cereal box with 10 times that storage.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.760]   If I were not last to my computer right now, I would be going into my library and pulling
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.920]   out ye old computer catalog.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.240]   That is the actual title.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.720]   It's one of my most prized relics in my collection.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.560]   It is a 1977 catalog of all the peripherals you could get for every computer out there.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.800]   I always turn to the middle page where they have all the fixed disk storage, a 5 megabyte
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.200]   Winchester for $5,000.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   We bought that.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.080]   I talked to my boss into buying that.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.040]   That was one of my first real computers.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.200]   It was a North Star Advantage running CPM.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.000]   We got a 5 meg hard drive.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   You could get a C compiler because there's enough room for a C compiler, but it would
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   come uncompiled.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.000]   You could actually bootstrap the compiler up bit by bit.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.200]   I'm looking to specs on lowenmac.com which John thoughtfully sent out to us for the two
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.280]   FX.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.000]   It was 40 megahertz, a 40 megahertz processor, four megs of RAM.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.800]   It could go all the way up to 128 megabytes of RAM, which at the time really was amazing.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.280]   This was system six.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   Get ready for this.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.040]   You ready for the price?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040]   $9,900.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   $9,900.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.560]   Unbelievable.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.080]   Six new bus slots.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.440]   Actually now I'm looking at this.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.960]   I only have three new bus slots.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.880]   Maybe this isn't a two FX motherboard.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   This one.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.400]   The new bus slots were kind of a big deal.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.600]   This might be another Apple II of another.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.560]   Yeah, I mean, that was a big deal.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   That was a pass button.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   That was a pass button.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   That was a pass button.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.920]   Well, it went the way of a firewire iPods.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.840]   Do you remember John the Dark Foster?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.000]   It was a bus that actually came out of Texas Instruments.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.840]   The problem was that it was only designed to go, I believe 30 megahertz is its fastest
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.400]   transfer.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:09.120]   By the time PCI came out with the first power PCs, the bus had ended up life.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   They just ran out of room.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.440]   They needed more pins for address space and they needed more speed.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.040]   It was, although I have to say, given that it was competing at the time against the
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.280]   ICIP bus on the PC, at least it didn't have things like interrupt conflicts and things.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.320]   I mean, at least it was intelligent for crying out.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.800]   Well, it was a modern bus.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.880]   I mean, the idea was is that you could just put a card in and then it would self-configure
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   and it would work.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   Amazing.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.880]   And I know the thing with the Mac 2, when it first opened, when it first shipped, it
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.120]   was the first computer that you could put in multiple video cards and it would span correctly.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   Right.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.320]   That was a big deal for people who work around multiple libraries.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.520]   And it's still a big deal because, you know, if you have some versions of video cards
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.680]   on Windows, you might draw, it might draw the dialogue in the middle of the two screens.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   Right.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Not a good one.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.840]   You know, this is 2007 and it draws its smack in the middle between spanning across the
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   screen.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   Right.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   That's why you want him.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   And we got more coming up on this episode of Mac and Tush Memories.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.680]   Whatever this is.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   Let's get back to the future.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   Seven more.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   Two USB onions on our belts.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.080]   That was the style at the time.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.160]   Wait, can we talk about HyperCard next week?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.760]   That was my first favorite program.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.760]   I would love to talk about HyperCard.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   That was a revolution.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   You know what we should do.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   HyperCard was the ultimate procrastination tool in my life because I got my SE or my second
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.200]   year of college and I said, yeah, this is such a classic Merlin.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   I just, I spent like two weeks trying to come up with this system where I could like store
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520]   everything in HyperCard.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.960]   I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.840]   Even before getting things done, he was desperately trying to get something done by kicking around
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.320]   with his computer more.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.360]   HyperCard was such a time sink.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.880]   I remember it came with the clip art so that you could, you could draw your own buttons
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   and you could make all this.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.200]   And I was convinced that I was going to be able to make this like entire like integrated
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.120]   system that would have all of my notes for everything in my application.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   I missed HyperCard.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   I missed.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   I want one now.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   I want HyperCard right now.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   I used HyperCard.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   I'm always like the card.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.920]   My, one of my big HyperCard projects was when my wife was pregnant with our first child
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   back in 92 or actually late 91.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.560]   I was, I wrote a HyperCard stack to time the contractions.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.320]   Oh my God.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.360]   Thinking, you know, I think it was handling anxiety, but thinking, oh well, you know,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   the best way I could use a stopwatch, but the best way would be every time I pressed
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.920]   a space bar, it would start the timer and it would, it would make a log and do a graph.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.280]   And then when it got to a certain point, we call the doctor very orderly.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.800]   Let me tell you, Merlin, someday you're going to know this pain.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.400]   Leo, get away from the computer.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:53.760]   Has anybody, has any enterprising developer out there with, with, with, with a mad Ajax
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.360]   skills ever done in emulator?
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.520]   Oh, would be great.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.120]   It'd be pretty, it'd be pretty fun.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.520]   And like you could, I mean, like it's not like it did that many different things, but
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   it seems like a good developer could go out there.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.000]   And you could say like that with, I might invest in that product if it exists.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.400]   Well, I think make the dream happen.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.640]   There's a lot of stacks out there.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.120]   You know, my dad did a whole geology stack for it on about a Simpsons, a, or no, a Darwin's
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   journey of the Beagle.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.040]   I mean, there are a lot of, a lot of educational stacks that are kind of more abundant now,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.360]   kind of a lesson for us all in file.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:28.040]   Well, there's a, there's a tool called Revolution from the company called Revolution and their
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   URL is run rev.com and they make essentially what is hypercard today.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.920]   But I think we need, I agree with Merlin, we need a web based Ajax free version and I
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.040]   bet it wouldn't be that hard to do.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.480]   What I really want to see is a dashboard widget that runs hypercard stacks that would actually
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   make dashboard useful to me for the first time in a year.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.280]   There's one use.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.080]   I got a, I got a dashboard widget just the other day that I thought was really good.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.800]   You're going to, maybe I'll save this for my free file.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.360]   I think it's a clock.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.200]   You bring it out and it tells you what time it is.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.720]   And three dimensions though.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.640]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   Let me finish.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.000]   Cause then you can say if you want it to be an analog clock or one of two different kinds
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.800]   of a digital clock.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.360]   Cause I think a lot of people.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.680]   A lot of people today feel there's a dearth of clocks in their life.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   Luckily there's a key that will bring that right up and you can see the time.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   Okay.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   Never mind.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   There goes another file.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.080]   I love that that's like the hello world for everybody.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.400]   Like, Hey, we have this exciting new paradigm breaking technology and we're just going to
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   be a clock.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.280]   It's like a Christ.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.640]   And this, this from a man who uses his computer to put himself to sleep.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   I know.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   Geez, Louise.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   Cue the choir.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   Don't forget.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   I had a great pizziz yesterday.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   I mentioned the twit code when you were.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   You're 25% off.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.800]   I had a 20 minute, I had a 20 minute pizziz yesterday that was awesome.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.640]   Pizziz is basically paying our bandwidth bills every month.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.560]   I get a check from 800 bucks from Pizziz.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.160]   So please use that coupon code twit and keep buying pizziz because it works.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.080]   You know, I had a pizziz yesterday at the restroom at the Metreon.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   Oh, no.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.920]   God, you can rock me to sleep tonight.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.320]   Steve Jobs, Spymaster, a judge ordered Apple last January to pay $700,000 in legal fees
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:28.800]   for websites that Apple sued because the websites had released information about a product
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.400]   code named Asteroid.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.560]   Apple sued looking for the identities of the leakers, lost the case.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.920]   Not only lost the case, but the judge said, you're going to pay the legal fees.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.360]   But here's the most interesting thing.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.160]   Asteroid according to this column, this is Leander Kehaney's a column.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.240]   He's the cult of Matt columnist and wire news.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.600]   Asteroid was invented, made up.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.800]   It was a trap that Jobs made up.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.320]   Alex has said that Jobs is known to do this.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:05.440]   Release this information about a non-existent product and then you to a very small limited
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.920]   number of people.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.840]   And then when the information leaks out, you know who your leakers are.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   Those Sally have a size 48, bro.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   46.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   That's a good job.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.000]   Are you a baby Scott or is there something?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Absolutely.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.920]   I think it's clever and I think it's brilliant because on the one hand, it's great because
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.200]   it is a great way to track down.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   Lix Parris Hilton did a similar thing with her friends to find out who was telling stories
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.680]   and tracked it down to Nicole that way.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.280]   Is that how they broke up?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   Yeah, that's how they broke up.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.240]   But there's the funny part about it.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.840]   It's like, you know, we've talked about this half dozen times.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.840]   We're talking to somebody from Apple and they just get this stricken look.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   I can't tell.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   You're like, do you know anything about Phu Barbat?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.120]   And you're like, I love my family.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   I love my job.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   No, I think that's the fun.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.160]   It seems like it must be kind of crazy making to have all this like to know that you're
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.480]   being fed weird information occasionally just to find out if you're a stoolie.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.680]   Kehaney points out the obvious flaw to this argument, which is that if that's the case,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.160]   why did Apple have to sue to get the names of these people?
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.480]   But Steve has done this.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   This is called a Canary Trap.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.000]   Steve has done this before, according to inside sources.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.840]   Nope, I have been told that I've been a target of the Canary Trap myself like years
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.560]   ago when they were trying to get at Seal the Leaks inside Mac Week.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.400]   Fortunately, I'm too lazy to do to write about things in a timely manner.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.320]   So I was actually bulletproof against these sort of things.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.520]   That's for breaking an embargo?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.080]   Not just for breaking an embargo.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.960]   There are two things that threw me off.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.200]   Number one, because it really smelled fishy to begin with.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.680]   Number two, the three things.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   Number three.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   Three things that threw me off of this.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.840]   Also, the information didn't really jive with what I was hearing from other people about
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.000]   the technologies.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.440]   And third, now this is not sure if I should talk about this, but hey, we're only on podcast
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   who's listening.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.520]   The couple at some point had mistakenly been of the opinion that Andy at AppleLink.com
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.040]   was one of their European vice presidents, not Andy and not go.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.600]   And so I used to get all kinds of really, really intensely insider for your eyes and
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   only status documents on everything they were doing.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   Oh my gosh.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.400]   I got on Rhapsody, on everything they were doing on OSWISE, on all the reasons that I
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.760]   get one official press release from Apple saying, "Oh, well, we're on track to release
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.160]   Rhapsody in the next quarter, then the next day I'd get an email intended for the vice
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.700]   president saying, 'Oh, well, here are the eight reasons why there's no way in hell this
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.160]   thing will ever ship.'
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.800]   In detail, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.240]   And the third time that I told Apple, "Look, you guys got your wires crossed.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.600]   I'm not that guy."
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.200]   The third time I emailed it and then knowing I was not going to get a response, I printed
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.240]   out a hard copy, mailed it to myself by a registered mail, and kept it in a very safe
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.000]   place in case I ever find myself telling a judge that, "Really, I told Apple, please
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.800]   don't tell me your top secret information."
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   That's amazing.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.600]   So you can do all your canary traps as far as you want, but if you don't pay the guy
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.400]   at the loading dock a fair wage, you're not going to keep any of your secrets.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.480]   According to Leander, Apple itself does the same thing.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.200]   He says Phil Schiller says he's not allowed to tell his wife or kids what he's working
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   on.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.320]   His teenage son, who was an avid iPod fan, was desperate to know what dad was cooking
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.880]   up at work, but Schiller couldn't say a word.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.920]   He took an iPod boom box home for testing, but kept it covered with a black cloth and
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.480]   listened to it only when no one else was around.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.760]   Steve set it up so that in case he talks in his sleep, he can beat himself on the back
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.000]   later for punishment.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.520]   He told himself disinformation just to see if he was doing that.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   He wanted to know if he was going to...
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.320]   Can I just point out that we probably violated some rule of the universe when Merlin mentioned
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.480]   the words brilliant and Paris Hilton in the same sentence?
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.000]   Well I've never met Paris Hilton.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.240]   I don't know what she's like, but she's I think when it comes to conniving probably,
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   she probably has mad skills.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   There you go.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.400]   Mad skills I can live with, brilliant stuff.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.760]   She's at least as good as Steve Jobs.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.720]   It's amazing.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.560]   It's pretty amazing though how long this stuff can stay under wraps.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.280]   Even with the iPhone, I mean to this day, I'm still pretty amazed that they've been
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   looking at the event.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.400]   So if we take it as red, that's some of the things that we saw whereas Alex likes to say
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.960]   JPEGs.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:43.360]   I mean still the fact that a functioning unit that he could go show to Mr. Index Card and
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.000]   play with for three hours in December is mind blowing to me.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.560]   That would be the president of Singular Foes.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.320]   How do they get that?
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.040]   That's a lot of hands that still have to be touching that.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   It's amazing.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.960]   That's a culture of very scared people.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:04.560]   When I was at Mac World two years ago, I got my press credentials and every time I got
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.480]   within five feet of the Apple booth, there were like Storm, Trooper, Jack booted thugs
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.320]   that would get between me and anybody else.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.120]   So this year, I didn't use my press credentials bad.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.400]   I used my speaker's badge and they would talk to me.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.840]   But boy, when I had the press credentials badge, if I just said how you do it, I said
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.560]   I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to disclose any information to the press of any kind.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   I was really surprised.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.760]   A friend of mine was working the booth.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   I took a picture of her.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.920]   So like, hey, you're in the Apple booth.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.000]   And about a minute later, she approached me very, very timidly saying, I've just been
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.440]   told that we're not really allowed to have her pictures taken.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.280]   And you could just make sure you don't publish it.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.440]   And I deleted it right then and there because she was a good friend.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   I'm like, what the hell?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.840]   Are they going to be disappearing her next week?
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.520]   She's going to be on the lost island.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.120]   They don't want any proof that she existed.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.920]   Hey, there's my friend.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.880]   She's on lost.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.000]   You must really like working for Apple, though.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.640]   You want to keep your job.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.880]   And if it's going to take that, then I guess you do it.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   We have a feature.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.160]   Oh, should we should we let me just before I go to the feature.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.640]   Any other stories of interest that some anybody wants to cover?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   We really didn't finish 7.1.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.040]   I guess there's not that much to say.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   We talked about the features.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.440]   We hit the main points.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.080]   Will Apple TV be out soon?
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.160]   I mean, they release finally release an update that supports it.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.800]   Does that mean we're going to see Apple TV this week?
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.320]   Not this week, next week.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.320]   I'm guessing.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.600]   I'm hoping maybe by WWDC.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.160]   I'm hoping I'm going to go home tonight and there'll be a UPS package.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.720]   Oh, wait and for me.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.080]   I told you breath till that happens, Leo.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.640]   At least, you know, they got--
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.080]   Whoa, whoa.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   Holy shit.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.040]   Well, Leo's holding his breath.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.440]   Let's talk about Paris Hilton's mark.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.080]   Oh, no, don't make me laugh.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.400]   And a cold Smith.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.760]   Now, the thing is we're heard.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.040]   We're caught in the same starlight cloth.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.560]   She is.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.360]   Oh, Dan, everyone.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.280]   Yeah, you did it.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.000]   Brilliant, brilliant person.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.480]   It's a brilliant Anthony Goldsmith.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:05.360]   Tonight is on Inside the Actors Studio, a star of actress of fine, fine compulsion
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.040]   for her days in Hawaii.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.520]   And in 1992, you're so good as to blast us with the guest advertising campaign.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.040]   The fossil--
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.720]   I would love the second.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.360]   It's too bad she never got to be on Lipton.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.840]   That would have been if she had-- she could have been on the actress.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.080]   I would have been learning better.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.160]   Honored beyond measure, welcome.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.120]   To grace our stage today.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   Stu--
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.320]   I'd you'll go out and get a tattoo to remember
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.120]   that you were here for the evening in which Anne Nicole Smith came to the new college.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.640]   But you know what?
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   We shall set fire to the building for none shall be allowed to enter.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.960]   None shall be worthy.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.240]   I could just see him now interviewing Merlin after his big hit.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.600]   Now, remember that classic hit, the phone guy.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.800]   I would totally hang with James Lippa.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.160]   I would totally hang with him.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.680]   This must be--
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.600]   He was on the rest of development.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   He's got a sense of humor.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   He was really.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   It's not a big one.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.360]   Not-- oh, yeah.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.280]   He was the warden of the prison that Joe wanted to break out of.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:29:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.000]   There you go.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.440]   This must be what it sounds like in the Saturday Night Live writers room,
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.120]   when they're really on a roll.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.160]   Except ours is funny.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.360]   But did you want to go?
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.600]   Only three of us cooked up.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   You can't switch three.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   It's a new game on Mac Braig Quigley.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   Text your guesses to 1, 4, 4.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.600]   I'm each call will cost you $1.99.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.920]   But you can enter as often as you wish.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.640]   Now, that's what we should be doing to raise comments.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.840]   There you go.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.880]   There you go.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.040]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.160]   He just solved the--
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.640]   cracked the whole podcast puzzle.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.400]   I'm here to serve.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.680]   It's all about text messaging.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.120]   And the thing is, don't even thank me for my generosity,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.640]   because I simply don't know any other way.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.120]   It's my nature, Lou.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.960]   It's my nature, Merlin.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.200]   So who's going to sign up to be a guinea pig
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.120]   for Mac Office?
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.720]   I mean, I have to, because my copy of Word
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.360]   crashed right when I was in Major Deadline for a book.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.160]   I am actually using Word on Windows,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.920]   because the only copy in my entire office is working out.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.160]   Do you have to use templates or something, Andy?
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.360]   You can't type in a text editor or something?
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   Exactly.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.860]   Oh, no.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.080]   I must make this a seash, I mean, are you--
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.680]   Unfortunately, book publishers are notorious
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.880]   for wanting their documents.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.520]   The Riley's a Riley's template.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.360]   You're talking to a man who's--
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.600]   I've been a columnist for the SunTimes for over seven years.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.880]   Now, every single newspaper column I've ever filed
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.800]   has been written using BB edit, a plain text editor.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.600]   That's my word processor of choice.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.320]   That's what I use from all my web blog postings.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.000]   It's clean.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.520]   It's efficient.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.440]   It never-- and unlike Word, it never launches itself.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.760]   And then say, oh, by the way, I decided
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.200]   to strip all the formatting from the eight open chapters
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.520]   that were open the last time I crashed.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.880]   Do you-- I'm just curious now.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.360]   This is-- I know this sounds like a rat hole,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.480]   but the kids care about this.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.240]   So when you're in BB edit and you're typing for production work,
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   are you using Markdown or HTML or what do you use for formatting?
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.640]   I'm using HTML formatting because when--
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.240]   newspapers are such a wonderful amalgamation
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.080]   between Gutenberg type setting and the most high tech,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.360]   the most advanced technology you've ever seen.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.280]   Meaning that if you go into the-- if you go into the press room,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.240]   you will see the most advanced stuff going on.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.440]   But when it comes to the interface between me and my editor,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.760]   I email him text.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.400]   He edits it.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.280]   And he applies whatever mojo he needs
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.920]   to get the press guys to make sure that my italics eyes
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.280]   wears a italicized--
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.160]   John Foster and I do everything in tech, right, John?
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.640]   That's right.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.000]   Yes.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.560]   Good old tech.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.800]   Real layout.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.600]   It's funny when you encounter somebody who's not
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.040]   comfortable with that, though, because--
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.400]   of course, there's a lot of guys who are really just line editors
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.280]   with corner offices.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.360]   And of course, they want to go in and get everything up
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.720]   to house style with the way you're italics.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.880]   It's always italics, of course, is one of the things.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   For me, that's Markdown and a single underscore either style.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.200]   Markdown would be-- I wish somebody
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.040]   would adopt one of these textile or Markdown or something
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.760]   as a more universal system.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.560]   Textile.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.400]   I mean, for me-- and this is just the color of my crystal.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.080]   Textile has a little bit too much firepower for what I need.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.680]   Markdown is, I think as a grouper said, Markdown
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.080]   is John Gruber, who does for daring fireball,
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   actually wrote Markdown.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.760]   Markdown is meant to be easy to read as well as easy to write.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.280]   That's right.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.800]   It looks good as text, but it also
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.160]   can be translated into formatted tools.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.760]   And what's nice is that-- and if you guys don't know about it,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.640]   I'll put in a quick plug.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.560]   Jack, who works over at Obvious, wrote something wonderful
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.040]   called Humane Text.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.560]   Humane Text is a service that you can run on your Mac
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:23.440]   that will turn text into textile and textile back into text.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.720]   And you can hack on it to have it
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.480]   re-point to Markdown rather than textile.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.560]   So basically, it's a long way of saying
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.520]   that I live in Markdown.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.640]   I do everything in Markdown.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.160]   And so for me, Command Shift, greater than,
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.640]   turns a bunch of text into HTML with one click.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.200]   What's that called again?
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.840]   It's called Humane Text.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.760]   If I do a search for Obvious and Humane Text--
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.240]   One word.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.600]   Jack, the man who brought us Twitter, also wrote Humane Text.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   You know, we had to have Williams on net at night last night.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.080]   And that's going to come out at any minute now.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.560]   And yeah, really, Ev is a great guy.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.520]   Isn't he a great, like kind of down to earth humble guy?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   Totally.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.040]   I found out he was drunk afterwards,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.000]   and that really kind of surprised me.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.280]   He had a little wine, yeah.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.480]   No, he's like these.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.560]   I don't think he was wasted.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.960]   No, I'm teasing.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.280]   Seriously, yeah, I just want to say.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.680]   Speaking of wines, 158 Mac wines and counting on 43 folders,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.440]   you started something there, Merlin.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.680]   That's right, Leo.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.280]   I decided to take the idea that we inaugurated on Mac Break
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.800]   Weekly.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   And I said to my readers, you tell me,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.040]   we're always accused of being these unapologetic Mac
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.000]   fanboys, of which I kind of am.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.560]   And I said, you tell me, what is the thing that really
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.640]   grinds your gears about your Mac or OS 10?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.160]   And people were only two happy to tell me.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.640]   Wow.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.320]   158 people so far.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.760]   And there's definitely some threads.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.040]   What is it?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.640]   Dot DS--
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.400]   Oh, the DS underscore store?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.720]   That is so annoying.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.920]   Those files.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.560]   But that's only if you use PCs that you ever see that, I think.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.160]   But still.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.320]   Well, also, if you turn on invisibles, like I do,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.480]   in Pathfinder, you see it.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.920]   It's vexing, though, because it's very confusing
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.240]   when you get people files on it.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.680]   It's very 1980s.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.080]   It's not a good way to handle that.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.640]   I'm surprised.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.120]   Yeah, totally.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.160]   But the other one is Alex's Mac wine, which I have taken up,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.720]   also, is just so many things related to mounted drives,
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.200]   whether that's a thumb drive or a network drive.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.680]   So first of all, the whole--
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.880]   you have files up and you can't close this.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.240]   Also, the whole-- it disappears and you basically
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.160]   get a hang for four minutes until it figures out
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.280]   that a network isn't available.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.920]   That's the one that drives me crazy.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.800]   Remember, I couldn't find a wine until I read your post
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.680]   and I remember, oh my god, you're right,
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.000]   because I frequently will drag files from my Mac
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   to my PC over my network.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.840]   And if that PC is down or not there, forget it.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.760]   I have to reboot.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.720]   The Mac has to be--
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.840]   It's a functional lock up.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.000]   Yeah, it's basically--
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.440]   Finders too.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.120]   I just-- I thought that was kind of funny, though,
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.080]   because you know, we're-- of course, I am.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.680]   I'm a Mac fan.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.040]   I mean, what am I going to do?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.560]   Like, do Kineiform.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.400]   I mean, do it before I buy a PC.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   Or Windows.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.840]   It's a top-form Windows.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.200]   Windows Kineiform.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.920]   At least for Kineiform, we get to play with clay.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   That's true.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.840]   It's like--
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.120]   A lot of people hated the finder.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.400]   A lot of people hated the finder.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.360]   God, the finder.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.040]   Why do people hate the finder?
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.360]   The finder is so Jurassic.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.920]   I mean, first of all, the finder is--
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.480]   it feels slow.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.440]   Well, it's slow because it's not a Cocoa app.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.000]   It's basically the last remaining Mac application
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.080]   that hasn't been modernized.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.640]   Is it carbon at least?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.720]   Yeah, it's carbon, but its roots are in old, old, old code.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.120]   Isn't iTunes carbon, too?
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.920]   iTunes is--
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.000]   A bunch of Apple scripts stuck.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.760]   Because what I always say, because I
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.080]   notice it has the wristwatch whenever it's doing something.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:31.400]   There you go.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.120]   That's how you tell.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.600]   No beach ball.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.360]   But I mean, part of this is-- and everybody
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.200]   has a different reason.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   I want the Anna Karen in a line.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.240]   People who hate the finder hate it in different ways.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.120]   I hate it because, personally, now that I'm on Pathfinder,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.280]   I just see a tremendous functional deficit
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.480]   in for what I would call power user ability
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.840]   to move files around and be able to walk and shoot gum
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.880]   at the same time.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.680]   And just that whole concept, the whole metaphor
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.320]   of all that clicking to get from folder to folder
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.640]   is just maddening.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.840]   And so we route around it with things like Pathfinder
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.920]   and Quicksilver.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.360]   But I mean, I think it's time to really write the finder
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.640]   from the bottom up.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.680]   Well, we got one problem against that.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.520]   When I talk to folks inside Apple,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.440]   and I'm talking like really, really high up,
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.720]   I really get the impression that nobody cares about the finder.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.920]   They wish it would dry up and blow away.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.560]   They wish they didn't have to keep supporting it.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   They wish it were possible to ship a version of the Mac OS
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.600]   that did not include the finder.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.840]   There is not that one bearded man who
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.760]   will jump up on top of people's desks
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.000]   to get people to work and develop on the finder.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.960]   But if it dried up and blew away, what would we replace it with?
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.600]   A C prompt.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.960]   That's good to say, a shell.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.080]   So again, something a lot more like Quicksilver,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.200]   something that basically renders not only the finder,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.320]   but Windows Explorer type applications completely obsolete.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   I mean, this is an old style paradigm.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.080]   I can't remember the last time that I needed to really tunnel
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.920]   down through a folder hierarchy to get it what I wanted to.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.000]   So the only--
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.120]   My entire interface is through smart folders these days.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.400]   And through, again, just tapping the first three digits
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.240]   to get whatever I need.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.040]   So the only interface would be inside of applications.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.320]   Part of it is the hierarchical nature of folders
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.160]   also represents the hierarchical nature
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.480]   of how a Mac is put together.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.400]   It goes back to the HFS file system.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.560]   That's how the developers thought about it, too.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.520]   And so it really would require a basic,
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.800]   a paradigmatic rethinking of how the non-application area
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.680]   of your world happens.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   But it's not with you, Andy.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   Chief of what they should do is the Newton
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.240]   and have the right idea, the Newton operating system,
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.360]   have everything in a soup.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.200]   And if you could do one directory structure
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.400]   that basically emulated that, give us one application
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.640]   called the file mover so that we could have that same really,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.080]   really ego boosting, nerve soothing.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   OK, here's an icon.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.560]   I'm dragging it from one place to another.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.320]   I'm confident the thing has been moved.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.400]   But there's so much of the overhead, mentally,
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.120]   that can be taken off of our hands.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.480]   I would say that the whole paradigm of the Mac
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.280]   needs to be rethought.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.480]   Because as screens get larger and larger,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.560]   you've got menus that are stuck up in the corner.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.880]   Well, if I'm constantly flipping my mouse up there
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.800]   to go get a menu, that's not going to work.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.880]   And the idea is that Photoshop has,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.960]   that are stuck in the tools, are stuck in a palette.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   And they can't be moved around.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.360]   They can't be customized.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.040]   We're pretending that the computer is so 20 years ago,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.000]   where we didn't have the screen resources or the CPU
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.240]   resources to do customization.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.080]   Well, this is exactly my common complaint,
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.840]   that everyone seems to believe as though, my god, 1984,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.160]   we actually, we cracked it.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.040]   We found the perfect combination of user interface elements
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.600]   and human interface design.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.120]   We don't need to keep working on this.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:41.760]   We're done.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.080]   How can you do it?
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.200]   For a ton, for a ton, it was.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.080]   Yeah, it was.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.920]   But things-- well, that's where we're still stuck
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.760]   with windows and icons and menus and amounts.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.880]   We need someone to kick Apple's ass, the way
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.320]   that Apple kicked everybody's--
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.880]   I was asked 20 years ago.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.360]   I don't think you're going to see anything like that.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.520]   It's such a wholesale redesign of the user interface.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.840]   I want to have a window onto my desk here, don't I?
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.280]   Well, imagine how we--
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.440]   imagine time traveling back to 1979
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.360]   and trying to explain to people how a mouse would say,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.560]   but wait a minute.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.280]   If my words are not going--
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   if my words that I type are not going on the screen,
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:16.960]   where are they going?
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.520]   How do I know where it's going?
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.600]   If you can simply explain to them
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.280]   that there's going to be these overlapping windows,
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.680]   that if you click on one, the computer
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.800]   will sort out what it is you mean to be doing inside that window.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.920]   It's hard to explain something that doesn't exist
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   to minds that are not ready to accept it yet.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.560]   But when you see the idea of a blank canvas
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.800]   with no interface on it, that simply
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.080]   tries to figure out what it is that you're up to,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   Douglas Adams had something that was really, really brilliant
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.880]   in one of his keynote speeches, which
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.000]   is that when computing first started,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.920]   the 99% of all computing power was devoted to actually
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.520]   doing the thing you wanted to do.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.320]   Only 1% of the computing power was devoted to figuring out
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.120]   what you wanted to do.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.040]   You press a key, it read the key, and it
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.440]   did the thing it wants to do.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.600]   As computers and operating systems get more sophisticated,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   that starts to inverse.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.280]   Now it spends-- because there's so much power under the hood
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.200]   now, to convert keystrokes to text
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.440]   is maybe one fraction of 1% of a Macintosh's power.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.240]   It can spend 99% trying to figure out that, wait a minute,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.880]   he seems to be trying-- he seems to be--
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   just like Lassie, I'm getting the impression
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.120]   he wants to write a newspaper column.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.720]   What's that?
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.040]   You're running a column about the new airport base station?
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.680]   Yes.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.760]   We'll give you a text document.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   We'll automatically make sure it's addressed to your editor.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.640]   It will invoice people.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.360]   Yes, come on.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.440]   I thought she was just saying there's trouble at the mill.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.160]   So that could be--
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.080]   The other 99% goes to the MDS process.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.240]   It's indexing everything for spotlight.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.520]   NDRM.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.040]   Yes.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.320]   NDRM.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.720]   Well, what about the way the--
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.280]   What about the way the iPhone style interface?
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.560]   An iPhone style interface.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.720]   Well, that's actually one of the rumors that's floating around.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.680]   I've seen in a number of places who knows where it came from,
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.240]   probably Merlin Mann.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.880]   But that this touch screen interface
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.520]   with the two fingers and all of that stuff
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.800]   was actually what's holding up Leopard.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.240]   That's what all of Leopard is about.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.480]   Anybody give credence to that?
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.920]   It's a little bit of the minority report thing with Tom Cruise.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.440]   That's really wishful thinking.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.240]   Can you imagine all the infrastructure that
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   has to be changed around to make that work?
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.480]   Plus, is that really the most efficient way to do things?
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.760]   Every time I get more and more sophisticated
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.400]   with a certain laptop or a certain piece of software,
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.160]   it's never a case of using the graphical interfaces.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.600]   It's always a case of giving myself fewer excuses
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.720]   to take my hands off the keyboard,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.760]   because the more I have to start screwing around with,
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   I have to take my fingers off the home piece when I'm typing.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.000]   I have to start pushing things on the screen after my hands
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.560]   all the way back down.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.040]   The real ninjas are the people who
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.920]   know how to do a command opt and shift till the escape L.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.720]   If you're honest with the very handy--
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.200]   Windows is totally based on that.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.120]   You can do everything.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.880]   A lot of people have that I have to admit increasingly,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:57.560]   because I have to get behind, is just these really vexing
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.920]   differences in interface throughout the Mac.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.880]   When you're first using it, you don't notice it all.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.040]   Everything looks beautiful and shiny and you want to lick it.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.080]   But then the more you use it, the more you realize
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.800]   that the way, for example, I think almost all of us
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.560]   are using universal access to be able to tab through web
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.640]   pages, you can tab through dialogue boxes.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.760]   Tell me about that, because I'm not.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.120]   Are you doing that, Andy?
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   And what about you, John?
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.240]   You're also using these features.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   Sure.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.440]   Command queues all the way.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.040]   I'm an idiot.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.240]   OK, so I go to universal access.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.440]   Is it in seeing, hearing, keyboard, or mouse?
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.640]   It's the first one where you want to enable--
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.400]   I've enabled assistive devices, but that's only because I
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.560]   need it for a text expander.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.520]   Right, exactly.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.880]   And I think-- and then so what do we need to do?
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.240]   Isn't there something you need to do inside of--
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   and then, for example, inside of Safari, you can go in and say--
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.920]   So you can tab-- oh, yeah, you tab from Victor Link.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.880]   But so I mean, I guess what you discover is--
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.400]   I use the--
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.320]   Oh, man.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.240]   Oh, dude.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.440]   Going through forms, for example, it
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.760]   can be so much faster using nothing but your tab
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.520]   and your space bar.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.560]   It's so fast.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.680]   Anyway, I was going to say, it was a drawn out point,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.600]   just to say that it would be nice if similar affordances
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.240]   in different parts of the Mac kind of work together
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.520]   in similar ways.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.480]   And I think that's maybe 80% and 90% there right now.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.520]   But it's just frustrating enough that it can be--
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.560]   it'll stop you in the middle of a flow,
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   because the stuff doesn't always act in the same way.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.880]   The key chain, for example, acts real goofy to me.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.840]   Oh, always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.240]   That's probably what it is.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.800]   What it is?
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.400]   But I'll tell you, for going through forms, actually,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:30.800]   we did a Mac--
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.320]   Advanced General.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   We did a Mac break minute on this.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.640]   To me, I want to tell everybody in the world about the power
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.960]   of the tab and the space bar and the--
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.200]   No, we're on the tab.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.720]   --the power.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.800]   People don't know what you can do with those two things
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.600]   that your space bar is at Dew Bar.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.360]   Whatever you have selected, whatever
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.720]   has turned like blue or gray, you can do that.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.320]   But my bar is connected to the Dew Bar.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.520]   Dew be Dew be Dew Bar.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.480]   Back to the tab bar.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.920]   All right, so let's do our wines.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.880]   So there were obviously plenty of things
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.720]   to wine about, according to your readers at 43 folders,
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.240]   158 different wines.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.800]   But I bet we can find a few more.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.640]   Let's start with John Foster.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.920]   Do you have a wine for us, John?
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.600]   I have a wine, and it's in general just the damn beach ball.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.800]   I have 2 gigahertz times 2 sitting in front of me.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.680]   Yet it's bins for no reason at all.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.480]   And I don't get that.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.720]   I don't understand.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.120]   And if anyone in Apple QA isn't writing up beach ball reports,
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.920]   that's what their job should be.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.240]   It's to find every single instance of where this thing hangs up
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.920]   for no reason.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.040]   You watch the activity viewer, and there's
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.520]   tons of RAM available.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   And there's tons of RAM.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.000]   And there's--
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.500]   There's no--
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.000]   There's no--
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:41.840]   There's nothing's happening.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.280]   There's nothing CPU-wise.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.040]   So it's almost like it's in stealth mode
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.840]   while it's just going, cat.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   Right.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.240]   But particularly Safari, I almost completely stop using Safari
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.520]   because Firefox just gives me the spot.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.960]   Almost like 1/10 as much as often as Safari does.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.480]   I--
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.800]   Pop open five tabs in Safari and just watch that thing go.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.880]   It'll be like 45 seconds.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.680]   I haven't seen it, I guess.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.200]   Like it's no day.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.040]   You get the afternoon off.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.160]   That's why I use Firefox.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.200]   I don't see it in Firefox.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.760]   Although I see beach balls from other--
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.480]   It sounds like it's program specific, not.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.960]   Well, it's just task-- it's just everywhere specific.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.800]   And it'll be in stuff like in iMovie or iPhoto
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.760]   or even the text editor or even in something as simple as,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.840]   I click on a drive to go get a directory of it,
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.960]   and it spins for 30 seconds.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.720]   It's a directory.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.880]   If I went into the command line and typed in Rm---
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:35.160]   No, no, no, no, I mean ls, then it would just show up instantly.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.000]   Now, do you have many meters or something installed?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.520]   So you can see how often it's paged into disk.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:39.960]   You know what?
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.080]   I turned all that stuff off because it was just frustrating
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.640]   to me.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.760]   I actually run centimeters all the time.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.000]   So you think it's paging?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.960]   You think that's the issue?
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.080]   Well, that's probably--
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.040]   I mean, it's fairly-- a lot of this,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.000]   a lot of this for me is a psychological problem
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.880]   where I don't mind when someone's busy,
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.000]   so long as they have a reason to be busy.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   It gets me a lot less frustrating when I see, OK,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.520]   there's a 1K plus indication in how many pages--
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.800]   how many-- how often it's paged in a memory.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.400]   How many pages are active right now?
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.600]   So if it's a little bit kerfuffled right now, OK,
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.200]   I'll give it three seconds to settle itself down.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.720]   It's when you simply copy two files from a keychain drive
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.360]   to a hard drive, and now you're stuck for like 80 seconds.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.000]   You're saying, you know, I paid $2,000 for you, man.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.640]   I'm expecting more from you.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.400]   The issue is this.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.840]   Back in the days when we actually had human interface
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   guidelines as a published document from Apple,
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   we had some rules that said, if you're
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.280]   going to be less than 10 seconds, you can spin the clock.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.760]   If you're going to be more than 10 seconds,
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.920]   you've got to put a dialog box up with the progress bar.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.200]   And if you're going to be really long,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.840]   then you've got to do guesstimates on time.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.640]   And those were rules.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.720]   We had as developers, we had to go and use those things.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.760]   Do you think, though, that I have to say,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.640]   I think it's more like a endless loop or a hang?
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.280]   I think it's maybe they're not putting in timeouts,
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.160]   but I don't think it's an issue of responding properly
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:55.720]   to the user.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.200]   I think they're hung.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   Yeah, well, whatever it is, if it's a system issue,
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.720]   then these things need to be fixed.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.960]   And I hate that it's one more time,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.720]   like, oh, well, we'll fix it in 10.5.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.680]   But because this has been going on continuously
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.840]   for five years now.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.600]   No, I think--
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.960]   You can watch this in the activity monitor.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.880]   And you'll just see these random-- if you're running
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.080]   all processes showing, not just my processes,
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.280]   you'll just watch this little--
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.800]   I don't know-- this little folk dance of processes.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.320]   And it's not clear at all which one of them is the problem.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.080]   Like, kernel task.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.320]   OK, thanks.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.240]   That helps a lot.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:28.680]   Right.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.760]   It's like, well, your car doesn't run
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.560]   because you've got a problem with your car.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.880]   Thanks.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.760]   All right, beach balls.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.400]   That's John Foster's Mac Wine.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.760]   And we wanted you to know that if you're a Windows user,
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.600]   you're not allowed to use these to complain about the Mac.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.400]   Although the beach ball is the number one thing
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.000]   Windows users use against us.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.520]   Annie and not code, do you have a wine?
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.440]   I'm almost past the point of whining about leopard
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.240]   at this point.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.840]   Where is leopard?
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.160]   Exactly.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.320]   Well, this is part of the frustration
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.680]   in the brilliance of Apple when they're not
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.160]   going to announce a date for anything
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.480]   until it actually appears in your doorstep.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.960]   They've said-- the only upgrade they've given
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.400]   on the ship date for leopard is they
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.200]   used to say first half of 2007.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.240]   They changed that to spring of 2007, which really got me excited
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.520]   until I realized-- looked at the calendar
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.880]   and realized that spring ends like two weeks before--
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.040]   2.22.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   Exactly.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.480]   And we still remember Steve Jobs standing
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.240]   front of God in the world in August saying that, well, we're
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   going to be showing you much, much, much, much, much, much more
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   features later on.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.200]   But this is what we're showing you right now.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.800]   And we're the new features that we haven't seen yet.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.320]   If we are three or four months away from shipping,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.720]   you would think that they would at least--
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.120]   the instructors show the rest of their cars right now.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.480]   There have been pictures this week
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.960]   on the net of the latest leopard build.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   Anybody looked at them I have.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.720]   And I don't like to look at stuff I can't get.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.880]   I think it's really interesting.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.440]   I've seen.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.040]   But we get all excited about seeing about this Mac.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.960]   And it's running 10.5.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.320]   And that's not a feature.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.840]   That's not something that helps with my--
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.320]   So that's the only thing the pictures have said.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.800]   They haven't had pictures of features.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.280]   No, they've got pictures of features.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.560]   But I'm just saying that just in general, it's stuff like,
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.920]   here's a configuration screen, or here's a preference screen.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.720]   Who cares?
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   Let's just see the real thing.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.080]   Well, I'm going to be the contrarian on this.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.560]   I think it's great that Apple doesn't pre-announce.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.800]   I wish they hadn't said anything.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.720]   And you guys wouldn't be whining about it.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.240]   I'm not whining about 10.5.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.120]   I'm just saying, let's just see it.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.360]   Yeah, we'll see it when it's done.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:28.880]   What's wrong with that?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.440]   We'll see it when it's done, exactly.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.560]   Not only for our own Marburg Curiosity,
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.160]   but because there are people whose job it
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.960]   is to buy 500 copies of this at a time.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.200]   And they have to make those decisions at least six months
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.400]   before the thing is released.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Every single previous release of OS 10 has come out.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.200]   At least one year in advance, Apple has again laid all their
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.040]   cards to the table saying, we're not ready to really ship
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.760]   this yet or even really show these features.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.360]   We've put out these features in front of developers yet.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.880]   But here's what it will look like.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.480]   Here's 98% of what you got.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.560]   That's legit.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.680]   And so I'm just worried, especially since this is the year
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.760]   that Apple can gain the most ground against Windows,
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.720]   because Vista, my god, it's like putting--
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.120]   it's like a pimped out Volkswagen Golf.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.960]   I mean, it's still a Volkswagen.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.840]   No one really cares about it.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.120]   This is really a good, such good opportunity
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.960]   to pick up new users.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.280]   That's a pretty apt description.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.480]   Now I was going to get one of those from my new limo company,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.400]   a Volkswagen Golf, pimped out one.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.240]   A rear stabilizer, three feet high.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.320]   I would stretch it so two people get fit in it.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.880]   But that underscores the fact that, believe me,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.080]   Apple knows that, Andy.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.760]   And if they could get leopard out,
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.080]   they would get leopard out.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.120]   So obviously something's holding it up.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.440]   Someone's holding it up.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.040]   I don't know.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.800]   Everyone, ICE, I don't know.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   Either they're going to pull the damnness rabbit out
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.320]   of the hat sometime really, really soon,
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.560]   or perhaps we're looking at a leopard that's not
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.160]   going to be as advanced as we hope it to be,
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.280]   or we're going to look at a delay.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.080]   I don't know which one's going to happen at this point.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   Do we have some agreement that leopard will
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.800]   be a very, very important upgrade or not?
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.160]   I don't know.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.880]   Only it comes out in 2008.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.440]   Unless they've missed it.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.240]   I mean, they don't look real important.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.960]   I think it's a very important upgrade.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   Look at all the backgrounds, technologies
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.920]   we're getting in it with core animation,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.520]   the next version of core sound, the next version
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:21.080]   of the display stuff, the resolution independent icons,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.440]   and the rest of the UI.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.960]   I think this is a very exciting OS.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.720]   And even if people don't adopt it immediately,
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.360]   it's still very worthwhile to see.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.080]   Well, what do you ICE changes have you really seen?
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.120]   We don't know.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.200]   I mean, we don't know, do we?
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.560]   Well, I mean, I haven't actually played with it.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.080]   I haven't seen it right here, but I'm not
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.000]   going to install a damn thing.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.040]   Who's to know what it's actually going to do?
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.000]   I mean, the idea of core animation
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.840]   being the foundation for applications in the future
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.720]   makes for--
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.360]   as a developer, it's like, OK, well, what can I do with that?
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.520]   How can I make the user experience much better?
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.120]   And you just have to look at the iPhone
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.080]   to see what core animation will do for software.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.720]   Exactly, for lots of things.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.800]   When you look back, I guess the constellation
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.640]   is that you tend to see that Apple tends
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.440]   to alternate between OS releases that are intent
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.400]   for developers all excited.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.160]   And OS releases are designed to get the users all excited.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.360]   Last year with Tiger, we got an OS
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.120]   that the users could really get excited about.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.960]   Maybe this is just going to be a developer-oriented update.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.160]   Scott Bourne, do you have anything to whine about?
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.920]   I'm probably the least whiny at all when it comes to Macs,
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.760]   because I really do enjoy them.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.040]   And because I also use them with knowledge
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.800]   of the giant blue screen of death is my alternative.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   But lately, in fact, just over the last two days,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.520]   I've had a perplexing problem I would like to whine about
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.680]   primarily, because I'd like somebody to help me fix it.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.440]   And I'm sure our smarter than me audience knows the answer to this.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.120]   But every time I down-load something to my desktop these days,
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.360]   it stacks up on top of itself in the bottom right corner
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.960]   of my screen, instead of neatly filling out
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.040]   the leftover space on the screen.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.080]   I don't have that many things on my desktop.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.880]   But for some reason, it just all stacks up.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.000]   And I get like 25 things piled on top of themselves.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.320]   And I have to drag them one at a time off to find out what's there.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   And I've tried doing everything I can.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.640]   I've run disk warrior.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.160]   I've run all the cool little utilities.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.960]   And it's just started doing it, and I can't get it to stop.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.800]   And it's--
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   Go ahead.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.320]   Go ahead.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.480]   No, you go ahead.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.440]   I was going to say that happens to me a lot, too.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.920]   And usually, the way I fix it is I first of all,
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.200]   to uncover the stuff at the bottom of that pile,
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   I just go into the desktop folder through my home folder.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.440]   That's that way you can just see it has a list of files.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.760]   Also, it seems that when I move that into another folder
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.840]   and then move them back, that tends to de-discombobulate
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   whatever it is that's making the finder upset
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.760]   and want to have a cookie to restore its blood sugar.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.280]   I wish I knew why I was screwing up.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.920]   It's just screwing up.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.120]   And I just know something that way
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.160]   that knocks me sense into it.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.440]   The thing is, Andy, is this just started happening to me.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.120]   It's never happened to me in my life.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.920]   And I don't like being discombobulated or combobulated
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.520]   whichever it is.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.160]   Don't discombobulate the man.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.960]   So if anybody knows how to fix that, send us an email.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.560]   Let me know.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.840]   Marlon.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.440]   I am vexed by the fact that my sound settings get
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.560]   so kerfuffled all the time.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.240]   Ordinarily, day to day, I have my sound settings set
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.440]   so that I don't really use the microphone,
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.000]   except when I'm doing podcasting stuff.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.520]   And it seems to do well enough with putting the sound out
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.160]   to my external speakers or my headphones.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.440]   But it drives me crazy.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.360]   We talked about this a little bit many times in the past.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.760]   But when I want to go use Skype, I've got to go in
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.640]   and I've got to go reinvent the wheel every time.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.360]   I've got to go in and say, no, use it.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.440]   No, no, no, no, Macintosh is the road podcaster
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.160]   that I just plugged in and use that for the headphones too.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.640]   And then I go out and go into Skype.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.720]   And about 50% of the time, I've got to remind Skype
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.360]   what I want to do.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.880]   And what I want is something like the old school system
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.320]   nine location manager.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.800]   I want something that lets me remember a configuration
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.280]   of sound settings so that I can repeat them with one click
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.200]   without having to do a lot.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.880]   And I want applications to honor that.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.280]   I can solve your problem, Merlin.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.400]   What's that, Scott?
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.040]   You need to go to rogameba.com and download a free program
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.520]   called Sound Source.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.600]   They do such great stuff.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.120]   I love roger.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.600]   They do wonderful stuff.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.560]   And all you do is put Sound Source.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.480]   It just becomes one of those little icons in the top right
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.760]   part of the interface.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.320]   And then you can simply click on it
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.360]   and select whatever configuration you want.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.520]   It automatically gives you access to that without having
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.840]   to go in and load all that stuff.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.040]   Good job, Scott.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.040]   Hey, Bob.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.080]   You know, every once in a while, the old guy gets one.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.600]   Totally.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.640]   Well, you know, actually, if I get one more menu extra up there,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.120]   I'm going to do it.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.200]   Well, that's a new one.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.040]   And you'll have to save that for next week's show.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.000]   I just did-- hey, listen to me plugging myself on the Merlin
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:55.200]   show.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.680]   I just did a little screencast on how to use Quicksilver
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.120]   and whatever.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.160]   It's a little quick screencast.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.880]   All every single email I've gotten about it
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.080]   is what's the thing in your menu bar?
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.680]   What's the other thing in your menu bar?
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.760]   I have so much crap in my menu bar.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.920]   It's like ridiculous.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.040]   It will temporarily solve your problem.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.680]   Oh, no, I'm totally going to do this.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.520]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.800]   All right, my wine is answered.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.520]   Leah, what's yours?
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.280]   I got no wines.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:16.680]   I love it.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.920]   I am still a wine fan.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   I am a Mac fan all the way.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   You're the Mary Tyler Moore of the Mac community.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.000]   It's such a--
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.480]   Throwing your hat in the air.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.120]   Turning the world up with your smile.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.640]   Make it after all.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   You can reboot after Colonel Pan is.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.800]   Guys, you're such winers.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.120]   I need to wine.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.120]   You're the one who brought it up, Leah.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.480]   It's not my fault.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   No.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   What about my needs?
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:53.880]   You know, wine-- whining was invented by these guys when I was gone one week.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.040]   I just want to point it out.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:55.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.760]   It was Alex's fault.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.240]   He wanted to do a whole show on him.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.120]   You guys seem to want to, so I'm going to let you--
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.920]   But we can all agree that it's not my fault.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.080]   It's your fault, Andy and I go.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.720]   I blame Andy.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   I'm the bad influence.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.480]   I'm the bad seed.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.320]   I'm the half breed.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   Very good.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   Very good.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   You know the playground?
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.800]   All right, let's move on to--
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.200]   Seriously, I just can't--
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.880]   whenever you guys mention something, I go, oh, yeah, it bugs me.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.400]   But honestly, it's not-- nothing's top of mind in terms of something that's bugging me.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.080]   And I use my Mac day to day.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.800]   And I don't find--
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.960]   I don't have any real names.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.040]   That is so lame, Leo.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.520]   You're on your not all day long.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.360]   And you got nothing that's grinding.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.040]   There's nothing that gets under your seat.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.720]   I just can't get it to talk to my Epson multi-function printer.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.040]   It won't scan images.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.080]   I have to use windows for that.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.320]   But that's about it.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.400]   I don't know if that's Max Vaulter, the Epson's Vaulter.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.840]   But that's not a-- that's not a wine.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.080]   That's a niggling little problem.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.640]   That's a niggle.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.160]   That's a niggle.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.480]   That's a type of guy who snaps one day.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.400]   And then we all find out about it on the news.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.600]   I'm a celebrity now.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.680]   I'm a troubled writer.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   David tonight is asking us.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.360]   We spotted.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.560]   He said, no, he was the--
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.360]   He's real quiet, mostly kept to himself.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.040]   He seemed like a nice guy.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.560]   So nice to his mother.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.200]   Never had a wine.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.480]   The largest collection of FedEx and UPS driver
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.320]   hats in this closet.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.560]   I don't know who.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.160]   I just look good--
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.760]   He's a guy never told to his house.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.560]   What can I say?
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.120]   He looked tremendous.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.400]   Tremendous in brown shorts.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.200]   I have a huge collection now.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.320]   Let's start with-- what order did I do?
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.960]   John Foster first, you have a software pick for us, my friend?
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.680]   I do.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.160]   Once in a while, I have a need to be
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.280]   able to bring down somebody's whole entire web presence.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.680]   OK.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.680]   So I don't know what happens.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.520]   It's a function of one of the jobs that I do.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:45.800]   Someone will say, hey, I need to quote or bid on this web page
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.240]   or this company site.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.320]   So I need to know exactly what they have.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.000]   So the way to-- one way to do it is just to manually download
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.240]   all that stuff and go see it.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:58.920]   Or you can use a program called SiteSucker, which coincidentally
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.480]   sucks the whole entire site from their web server
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.400]   to your hard drive.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.840]   The cool thing about SiteSucker is it doesn't have a cost per say.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.120]   It is shareware.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.840]   So if you use it lots, lots, you should definitely pay for it.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.920]   There's a pay button on the page.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.560]   I've looked at a lot of these things,
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.920]   and I could never remember what they were called.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.480]   And I'm like, you know what I need is something
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.760]   just called the SuckSites.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.840]   You know, like a SiteSucker.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840]   Like a SiteSucker.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.680]   And then there it was.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.000]   Would that work on the Hooters site?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.120]   Oh, Scott, I'm going to leave that to you
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.400]   to report to see if that's going to work.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.120]   And I just--
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.640]   I just wonder--
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.800]   When we said, kind of, settle in you window.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.160]   I don't think you really got the concept.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.800]   We're going for the baggy pants.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.520]   So I'm going to say that this product does suck.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.400]   It does its job very well.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.040]   It does its job very well.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.880]   No, I completely agree with you.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.000]   It is a very good program.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.680]   I've used it before.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.960]   And I think it's open source cross platform, isn't it?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.720]   It's not open source.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.280]   It's basically a shareware program that has--
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.560]   it goes out for free.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.640]   I mean, you can use your thought.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.560]   I think you've another one.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.480]   Oh, there is another one.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.000]   But I don't remember the name of it.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.800]   Because it doesn't suck in the name.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.080]   It doesn't suck as well.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.560]   But the version-- turns out the version that I was using
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.720]   was 1.61.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.280]   And there's a brand new 2.0 version, 2.01.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.760]   Excellent.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.120]   So there you go.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.240]   Let's head over to Andy and Nato and find out what his stuff--
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.480]   we kind of sprung this on.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.040]   I don't know if you were prepared ahead of time.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.160]   But if you've got one, that would be great.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:39.720]   No, that's it.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.680]   No, actually, it's actually very timely.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.800]   Because now that it was the new version of iTunes,
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.720]   and now it's got the full screen cover flow,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.400]   that kind of-- the reason-- I should admit that the reason why
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.920]   I don't use it is because I ripped all my CDs
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.000]   like a year and a half, two years ago, and practically
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.480]   nothing in my 1,000 CD library has cover art on it.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.000]   So I wound up-- now, this is something.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.040]   When a technology columnist says that he actually
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.520]   bought and paid for something, instead
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.680]   of asking for an evaluation copy for press purposes--
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.960]   Wow.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   I know.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.480]   Let's all take a second.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.440]   Tisis.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:12.800]   There you go.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.320]   See?
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.400]   That's the--
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.600]   Equinux has this really great app called Cover Scout,
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.560]   whose job it is to analyze your iTunes library,
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   look for any album that does not have cover art attached to it,
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.160]   and then help you find cover art for it.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.560]   And it will not just look in CD databases.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.000]   It'll look on Amazon.com.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.360]   It'll look on Google Image Search.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.640]   Any place that might actually have cover art on it.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.320]   I like this because I have to say I've
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.600]   been very disappointed at the ability of cover flow
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.480]   to find album art.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.000]   Right, exactly.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.960]   It means the only time that it's really one for one
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.720]   is when you buy stuff off the iTunes store.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.080]   And who's--
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.160]   But I already had cover art if you--
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.040]   Exactly.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.680]   And on top of everything else, if you can't find cover art,
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.600]   you can actually just hold up the physical CD
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.560]   to your eyesight camera, and it will actually
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.960]   take a picture right from there.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.560]   So that's great.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.480]   OK.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.160]   Of course, of course, all my Beatles albums have--
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.240]   if you can see me naked on the side,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.320]   but that's still--
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.960]   Is there a look in nothing in my right, gents?
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.680]   There seems to be a fifth member in Beatles for that pro.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.800]   He best finally makes it back into the band.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.560]   He's barefoot.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.760]   That's not his foot.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.360]   I call that my Steve Sucklift.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.840]   OK.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.120]   Good.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.880]   So what's that name again?
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.240]   It's called Cover Scout.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.600]   It's by Equinox, EQ UI, and you exit like 20 bucks.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.920]   And it's not a one-click solution,
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.000]   but you can process 100 albums in less than 20 minutes.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.120]   And in one night's work, I actually
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.000]   got cover art on 98% of all my stuff.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.200]   Excellent.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.120]   Mr. Scott Born, software please.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.640]   Well, I found something that's 0% of an Alex.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.200]   Cheap.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   At any price.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.880]   That's our unit, by the way, Andy and Otco is the Alex,
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.480]   which is the average price of a product
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.040]   recommended by Alex Lindsey, which what is that, Merlin?
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.080]   It's like $700.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.920]   $700.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   Oh, my god.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.840]   Most of Alex picks are $700.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.400]   This is free.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.440]   It's called Instant Shot.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.840]   And I found this for--
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.560]   There's nothing to do with hooters?
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.440]   Nothing whatsoever.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.960]   Why do you keep bringing that up, Leo?
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.640]   Anyway, Instant Shot is a screen capture utility.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.280]   And I found this for my 88-year-old Aunt Faye,
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.360]   because she doesn't want to pay for anything.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.920]   And she wanted a screen capture utility.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.000]   And this one works pretty well.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.040]   It does, unfortunately, Merlin.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.160]   I want to point this out that it does put an icon on the menu bar.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.840]   But what I like about it--
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.560]   What good is a program if it doesn't?
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.960]   That's what I say.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.360]   But you don't have to memorize any fancy keystrokes.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.040]   It puts the icon on the menu bar,
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.600]   so you click on the icon, tell it what kind of caps you want.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.000]   Like, oh, and you're done.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.120]   It's about as straightforward as it can be.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.320]   So it's called Instant Shot.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.520]   Just Google that, and you'll find it.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.000]   Instant.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.480]   And the icon doesn't appear in the screenshot?
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.440]   Excuse me?
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.240]   I'm sorry, the menu bar icon does not appear in the screenshot?
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:17.320]   Well, see, you can do it so that you get just a portion of the screen.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.200]   This gives you lots of capabilities.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.160]   You don't just do the whole screen.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.480]   You can do just a window.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.240]   We were talking about Snabs Epro, which is the one I use from Andrew Welch,
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.960]   from Ambrosia Software.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.040]   And Merlin, you said that you have something that you use.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:32.720]   Was it you, Merlin?
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   Yeah, my pick, last week, was an amazing program called Skitch.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.200]   Skitch.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.440]   And-- Oh, that was last week.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:38.960]   OK.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.680]   Yeah, it's impressive.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.640]   Right now, but I mean, this is a really, really, really good application.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.960]   And I think it's--
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.360]   I hate to be on Michael Harrington because it's not publicly available yet.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.400]   But once it is out, I think this is going to be THE application for this.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.440]   I mean, just here's one right here.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.000]   It's like, how often do you want to just go take a screenshot
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.640]   and show somebody on your team something that is above in a program or something?
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.760]   You have the ability to go in and create an unlimited, I think,
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:08.520]   unlimited number of FTP, SFTP.Mac, WebDAV, or Flickr accounts.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.360]   Oh, me.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.800]   You go in and you right click on WebPost and pick
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.640]   which one of those accounts you want to go to, Zing, it's uploaded,
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.960]   and you click then to just grab the URL.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.360]   See, that's not for Antfay.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.240]   That's really--
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.000]   And it's also probably not free, either.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.960]   No, I doubt it'll be free.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.680]   But for somebody who does this, I mean, increasingly, this is how we interact
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.520]   with the world through the screen in order to be able to communicate with each other.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.200]   I know with my tumble log, it's all screenshots these days.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.360]   Yep, yep, yep.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.200]   And I just want to mention one other thing on Instant Shot
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.680]   that I thought was really cool.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.560]   You can do timed screenshots.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.080]   Nice.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.200]   I like that.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.640]   So that way you can get into the picture.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.680]   You can run around on the other side and get into the picture.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.720]   I like to do that.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.520]   If you wanted to look at something over time as it changed automatically on a website,
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:54.800]   for instance--
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.320]   Oh, it'll do like time lapse.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.600]   Oh, I see.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.200]   Oh, then that's cool.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.960]   It's free.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.440]   And it's free.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.800]   Did you mention that it was free?
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.240]   OK.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:03.600]   It's free.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.880]   How much does it cost, Scott?
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.520]   Not one penny at all.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520]   Zero--
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.520]   Interesting.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.160]   Alex's or parentheses or whatever we call them.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.760]   Merlin, I think it's your turn.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:20.200]   This is a very modest but powerful little preference pain called RC default.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.080]   And RC default does something.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.600]   Now you can kind of do this in the Finder.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.240]   But how many times has it driven you crazy that you double click on,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.720]   like say, a .php file, and it opens in like Go Live totally randomly
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.040]   instead of my case text made?
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.720]   Well, what you can do is--
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.080]   I know this works in Pathfinder.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.040]   And I think it works in Finder.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.800]   You can go in and re-associate all of those types.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.840]   You can say always open .php with this.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.440]   Well, RC default takes us to the next level.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.000]   This is-- you go in and you basically, with as much granularity as you want,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.880]   tell it how you want your Mac to deal with all kinds of different things.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.160]   So you say, OK, for example, always open JPEGs in preview or what have you.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.800]   But it goes a lot further than that.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.920]   So you can always associate-- you can say, for this application,
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.560]   always open the following extensions.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.960]   You can say, for this extension, always open it with the following ways.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.800]   You can say, for example, you can even go in and say stuff like,
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.920]   when I plug in my webcam, I want this application to open.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.440]   When I pop in a music CD, if I don't want iTunes to open,
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.360]   I'd rather have this other application open.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:28.800]   Now, Mind Types, File Types, even down to different kinds of your configuration files,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.480]   like in your library, you've got your preferences, like com,
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.320]   or whatever, you can have each of those open in different applications, if you want.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.560]   So first of all, it's just really useful as a way to go in and really
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.880]   trick out your experience.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.120]   But second-- and I picked this up from John Gruber--
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.240]   when that exploit came out not long ago about launching the telnet protocol--
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.920]   remember, I think it was a telnet protocol exploit.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.200]   You can go in, and for example, disable telnet.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:02.440]   So if a new exploit comes along, this is a great way to kind of put a no-clobber
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.320]   into your world so that you can accidentally do something stupid.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:10.280]   But it's put up by Ruby code, rubycod.com, and it's free.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.440]   And it's a terrific little app.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.720]   Well, I also want to nominate a humane text as a kind of adjunct apt,
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.840]   because I'm downloading it right now.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.080]   I think that sounds like a game.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.200]   And you can go in.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.280]   I can try to remember how to do this.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.680]   It does mark down natively, right?
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.480]   I think it does humane text out of the box, but you can go in and
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.000]   repoint to whatever your slash bin markdown or whatever your install is.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.800]   Yeah, and then you can also then-- then what I did-- this is a little hacky inside baseball.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.880]   But if you go into the keyboard preference pane where you can go in and do all of your own,
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.520]   you can go make a custom key command for turn to text.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.160]   And I think it also-- I believe it also includes Aaron Swartz's--
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.880]   you can also have it point to Aaron Swartz's markdown back to text.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.800]   Right.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   Right.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.160]   And so this is just dynamite.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.840]   So for me, I live in web page text areas all day long.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   So I can type, type, type, type, type, and just hit turn into HTML.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.760]   And it's so fast.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.920]   So I wonder if I got the same one, because the one I got does markdown.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.040]   It's GU.ST.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.400]   That's it.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.280]   That's Jack's site.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.520]   I need to do it.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.920]   It does markdown natively.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.480]   So-- and if you do Shift-Apple left brace, it'll convert it to HTML.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.520]   But then it goes the other way with Shift-Apple right brace.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.720]   You ignore everything I said.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.440]   This does everything already built in.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.320]   Sounds like he's updated it, perhaps.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.040]   It's version 5.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.080]   So very cool.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.680]   I mean, I think that's going to be very useful to me, because I do type a lot of HTML.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.960]   Now, you could also do this with Quicksilver or Textpander
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.320]   and a lot of other programs, right?
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.560]   And you can-- I mean, Gandhi's probably got stuff like this
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.360]   that he's got bindings for and BB edit.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.880]   It's very easy to do this with bundles inside a text made.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.480]   But this is, as I say, Quicksilver.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.280]   This is universal.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.000]   So anywhere you are on your Mac, you want to type a line of text.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.920]   You can be anywhere and turn it into HTML.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.320]   And it sits so fast.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.160]   So I've been--
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.400]   So I was going to say, I actually write Apple scripts to do everything like that
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.040]   every time I find a situation where I need to grab that sort of stuff.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040]   Apple scripts.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.320]   And I've got like three or four different things hanging up my scripts menu
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.720]   to do while these different situations.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.720]   It sounds like this is one thing that anybody can install and will handle everything.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.320]   Right.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.000]   You can, of course, bind Apple scripts to a key as well,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.240]   if it's in your Apple script menu.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.080]   So you could easily do that as well.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.280]   I wrote an Apple script.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.400]   Apple script is really very useful.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.680]   Windows doesn't have anything quite as simple for just automating things.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.160]   And it's really handy.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.960]   I wrote an Apple script for my radio show because it's a network show now.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.360]   So I have to break exactly on time.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.120]   So I have Apple script call Quicksilver and write in big text.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.600]   You know, that great large text.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:42.960]   Right.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.760]   It's time to break.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.640]   So 60 seconds before I'm supposed to wrap, it'll put up--
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   I mean, on the 30-inch screen, it's big.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.720]   It'll say wrap.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.560]   And then when it's-- it'll give me a countdown, 10, 9, 8.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.000]   Count me down to the break time.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.760]   And I'm always on time now.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.160]   It's very cool.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:58.760]   It's wonderful.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.280]   The biggest-- the greatest demonstration about the power of Apple script
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.480]   is my latest book because it's tips that are both Mac's Mac specific and Windows--
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.840]   it's a list of tips.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.680]   And there's a Mac version and a Windows version in each chapter.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.440]   And in the Windows version, almost every tip is, well, buy this piece of software.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.560]   It only costs 10 bucks, but it does this wonderful thing.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.040]   On the Mac side, it's like, well, here, I took a screenshot of this automated workflow
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   with three steps to it.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.240]   Just make it look like this, and it's cost nothing.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.160]   What is the name of that latest book, Andy and I go?
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.240]   Why would be-- oh, God bless you, Leela.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.160]   God bless you.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.440]   iPod fully loaded.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.160]   It's basically the idea is that if you've got one megabyte of free space on your iPod,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.160]   you're not trying.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.200]   So this is how to really cram it up with everything you've got inside your life.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.680]   I love that idea.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.960]   So cool.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.400]   Load that sucker.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.800]   Not one drop of free space.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   But lately, I've been doing a lot of simple CSS for my tumble log and trying to make--
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.440]   I don't know why.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.920]   I have very limited capability.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.280]   I guess the less I can do, the more I'm challenged to do something interesting with the design.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.680]   And since it's very little I can do with it, all I can do is change colors.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.400]   I've been playing with colors and looking for complementary colors.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.680]   And I found a wonderful widget that does web colors or color wheels, does complementary
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.160]   colors.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.920]   It's called sphere.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920]   I can say that right.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   Sphere.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:25.360]   This may be a reason to get a dashboard widget to make you actually want to use a dashboard
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360]   widget.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.440]   For one thing, you can choose from a variety of wheels, everything from complementary
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:37.080]   colors to four tone, five tone, six tone, triadic, tetratic.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   You can even have a clashing color wheel.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.200]   And then you can choose a variety of visions, including people who are colorblind.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.920]   You can use web smart, web safe, or a full spectrum.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.840]   And it will generate colors with the dots in complementarity and then give you-- you
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.360]   can even save it out in a form that you can open as a plug in-- as a little file that
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.720]   plug it into Adobe Photoshop or other programs illustrator.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   It's really handy.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.880]   It's from colorjack.com.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.520]   And there's a web version of it as well.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.680]   You can play with on colorjack.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.920]   But I liked it so much I thought, oh, I should have this as a dashboard widget.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.520]   So if you notice the colors on my tumbler log changing every five seconds, it's because
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.600]   I'm playing with my colorjack.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.040]   Did you see the new additions to tumbler log today?
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.840]   No, he's added stuff again.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.840]   This man--
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.520]   Tumbler, our favorite tumbler application is added.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.600]   Tumbler.com has added a couple new features.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.360]   First of all, now when you mouse over, you get a permalink.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.320]   So it's much easier to see permalinks on stuff.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.880]   So you see the link to stuff.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   Go mouse over an item.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.520]   You'll see a little-- in my case, I get a little orange dot that appears.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.280]   Second, mobile posting is in testing.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.560]   So if you're not a Twitter-er, like we are.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.720]   So we should have announced, of course, in the meantime, now you can pull in delicious
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.600]   links, Flickr links, anything that's got an RSS feed.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600]   Yeah, that's neat.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.840]   You can have automatically feed into your tumbler log, which I've got going with four
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   feeds.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   David Carp is a madman.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   He's been adding stuff.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840]   It's moving fast.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.080]   This is really moving fast.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.000]   But then, yeah, so also another testing on mobile.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.040]   So you get an email address to which you can send stuff in it, post to your tumbler.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   I love it.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.880]   It's mblr.com.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.520]   Between Twitter, tumbler, and Vox, you really, I'm posting way too much stuff.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.360]   In fact, somebody-- there's an-- I should actually read this.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.760]   Scott Kurtz does a great online comic, PvP online.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:24.200]   I don't know if you see that PvPonline.com on a Saturday issue.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.920]   This is really going in along the lines of our clean tag being removed.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.080]   I'll just read you the comic a little bit.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.360]   Video conference with Chris quickly runs off topic.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.440]   Hey, did I tell you my great idea for a new Web 2.0 company?
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.440]   Not what?
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.080]   It's called Pooper.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.600]   Every time you take a dump, you post details on it at pooper.com.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600]   What?
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.280]   You describe your poop?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.400]   Like, Arby's was a bad idea.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.440]   If you have a laptop, can you poop or as you poop?
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   Check it out.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.760]   Leo reports on my Pooper's friends list.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.840]   This is what I know I've really gone too far.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.080]   That's pooper with no E.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.360]   Yeah, of course.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.640]   And by the time you hear this, there probably will be a sight there.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.840]   Anyway, thank you, Scott Kurtz, for that very nice plug.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.840]   And I should tell Scott--
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.840]   And find that kind of publicity.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840]   No, you can't.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840]   You can't even--
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840]   I've seen this.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.560]   This is close to my idea, Leo.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.400]   What was your-- oh, yeah, it was, yeah.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   You know what we could call it?
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.360]   H-O-O-T-R.com.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.240]   No, we call it Hooterer.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.240]   Mm.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.560]   Because you're the Hooterer.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.600]   Do you think this is going to get you free fries?
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.360]   Is that the idea behind this?
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.880]   Free anything would work.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.520]   I think it's going to get you a lot of free email.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.600]   That would be Scott at--
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.840]   I don't know what the heck.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.920]   We have to say that podcasting chick's dead.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.400]   Come.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.040]   That one doesn't work.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.600]   Thank God.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.640]   Do you actually-- you don't actually publish an email address.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.160]   And now I know why.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.640]   I do not for--
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.520]   and I still get 2,000 pieces of spam a day.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.160]   Trying the club.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.400]   That's partly because I have so many email addresses.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.520]   You can virtually type random text and reach me.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.720]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.040]   I'm the same way.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.320]   John Foster's been great having you.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.680]   We thank John because even when he's not on the show,
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.960]   he does the show notes for us.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.440]   I don't know why, but I really thank you for doing that, John.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:14.720]   It really--
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.600]   It's kind of fun.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.960]   You know, it's basically a good way to be on the show,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.240]   even if I'm not.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.320]   And I don't know if you guys actually read the show notes,
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.480]   but sometimes there's like little sarcastic things in there.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.160]   And you know that?
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.360]   Oh, you're not.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.840]   You know, you wouldn't do that, would you?
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.240]   Without sarcasm tags or anything.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.600]   Amazing.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.040]   If you go to twit.tv/mbw, you can look back
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.800]   through his great show notes of the past.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.640]   And of course, this one will probably have show notes too.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.360]   Sometimes soon.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.600]   Merlin Mann is very busy with the Merlin show.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.000]   And I'm thrilled that you're branching out
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.280]   into screencasts now, too.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:50.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.400]   We did our first screencast.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.440]   I mean, that's the funny part of something like this
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.800]   is that from the very first second,
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.320]   that there's a frame of anything on screen.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.280]   People get their own idea about what it's going to be.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.120]   And when I said in the first video,
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.320]   I don't know what it's going to be.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.240]   I was dead serious.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.840]   I mean, we started out with interviews
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   because that's what we had.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.160]   But it's going to be--
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.720]   I mean, you and I have talked about this.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.680]   It's going to be-- there's going to be a lot of surprises.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.880]   So I think it'll be fun for people.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.360]   But last week, we had John Vander Slice and Jonathan
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.080]   Colton and Chris Weatherall and Jeff Veen.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.160]   And we got some more really good interviews
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.880]   with people coming and more screencasts.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.720]   I think they're on their way right now.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.360]   Maybe if the guys are the white jackets, I'm not sure.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.960]   But they're in a hurry.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.000]   Sorry about that, Lyle.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.520]   That's great.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.840]   Now that you live downtown, Scott,
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.880]   you've got to consider those things.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.280]   The Comatrick is his current one,
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.080]   Quicksilver Comatrick.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.760]   I'm glad to see that the whiteboard in Ben Franklin persist.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.360]   We do what we can.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.760]   There are some constants in this old, ever-changing world.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.960]   Annie Nacos' latest book is Stuff Your iPod Full of Crap,
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.440]   available.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.320]   Unfortunately, that URL was already taken.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.560]   Oh, dang.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.920]   Because iPod fully loaded.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.040]   Fully loaded.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.160]   And published by--
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.240]   Wiley and Sons.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:07.800]   Wiley, the Wiley.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.840]   Actually, actually it was the dad who published this one.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.880]   They went all the way to the top.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.120]   And I'm fond of the concept it was.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   And incidentally, you can read his--
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.360]   not incidentally, it's great stuff.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.560]   His column is Chicago Sun Times.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.760]   Is it every day?
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.880]   Not every day.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.400]   It's four to six times a week, four to six times a month,
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.480]   depending on how many playmates get off in the offing.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:32.320]   I tend to get bumped for Anna Nicole's stories,
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:32.880]   not sort of thing.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.320]   Anytime they have.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.640]   But they encounter me at least weekly.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   Yeah, we love Andy.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.080]   And it's always good to have you on the show.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.760]   Scott Borne is at my iPodcaster trick
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.160]   surf-- are ready to go for you.condo.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.520]   Podcastingtricks.com.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.520]   And at iLifeZone.com, now on Podango.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.080]   Podango.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.120]   Yes.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.480]   And at iLifeZone.padango.com.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.560]   And Leo, we need to mention that you and I and Alex
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.640]   are going to be doing something March 28 through 30th
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.760]   right here in San Francisco.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.040]   Yeah, we want to get you to sign up as quickly as you can,
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.600]   because once we've sell 150 tickets, that's it.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.200]   It's done.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.400]   We want to limit the size of the crowd.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.160]   It's a special podcast seminar.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.920]   Three days, everything you'd ever
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.560]   want to know about doing an audio or video
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560]   show for the internet.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   Alex Lindsey of Pixelcore and Scott Borne
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.520]   of iLifeZone and myself will all be leading it.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.920]   We're going to have live--
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.120]   we're going to do Macbreak live.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.680]   We're going to do Twit Live from the ZM.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.760]   But you have to buy a ticket $300 for three days.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.680]   More information than you could ever absorb.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.120]   I mean, this is going to be everything--
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.520]   a complete core dump of everything we know about the--
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.760]   What is it that Alex calls it?
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.040]   It's a bleed from the ears event.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.920]   We promise you won't actually bleed.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.440]   Anyway, maybe he wants to slow down ticket sales.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.720]   I went and looked-- I got to tell you,
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.200]   I went and looked at your agenda for that.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.040]   And I am very tempted to buy a ticket myself.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.840]   It actually looks-- it actually does look really cool.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.200]   Wednesday is audio production.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.560]   Everything from mixers and mics to compression to--
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.720]   in fact, they're going to do an iLifeZone right there.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.080]   I guess Chris Breen will join you, Scott.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.400]   I don't know who's coming.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.560]   Our regular crew is Derek Story from O'Reilly, Colleen Wheeler
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.280]   from O'Reilly, Chris Breen from Macworld and me.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.320]   You are invited and said you would attend as a guest.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320]   It will be there, absolutely.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.560]   We have Alex Lindsay as our permanent special guest.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.480]   Mr. John Foster has been on the show.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.040]   Craig Seever-- we have just like Mac Break Weekly,
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.840]   a regular pool of talent we pull from.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.480]   So whoever shows up will be on the show.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.800]   Merlin, you're welcome to come just to sit in.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.560]   You don't have to say anything, but we'd love to have to--
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.880]   Say that now, but I'll show up and you're
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.760]   going to throw me out on my butt.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.360]   Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.200]   There's no more one.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.200]   You're going to have to sit outside.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.400]   Well, sir, there's an odor.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.120]   You're going to need to go ahead and turn that around.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.760]   And you can get information on this at twit.tv, right, Lee?
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.320]   Yeah, we have it right on the front page there.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.040]   Pixel Core has a big old page about it.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.320]   Pixelcore.com as well.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   Yep.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.360]   Isn't it Pixelcore.com?
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.520]   If you click the link that's podcast class,
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.000]   Thursday is video production.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.200]   And Alex is going to do a lot of great stuff
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.280]   about shooting, cameras, multi-cam.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.800]   Again, compression is very important.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.520]   But that's when we're going to do Mac Break, because that's
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.600]   a video podcast, so I'll be part of that.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   And then on Friday, designing your show--
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.560]   that's where I'm going to really do a lot of stuff,
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.200]   because we're going to talk about content, working with guests,
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.320]   hosting, promoting revenue models,
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.560]   and we'll do Twit Live on that Friday.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.760]   So it is a jam-packed session at the ZM Theater in San Francisco.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.120]   I hope you can make it $299 for all three days.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.760]   But hurry up, because as I said, we're
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.160]   going to limit it to 150 people.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:42.000]   And you go to pixelcore.com to register for more information.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.880]   And Podango and broadcast supply-wester sponsors.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.440]   And I have a feeling that, Scott, you had a lot to do with that.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.120]   Good bin.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.360]   We thank you.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.880]   We thank you.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.360]   I guess that's everything.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.800]   Anybody have any last plugs they'd like to get in?
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Merlin, themerlinshow.com, 43folders.com.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.000]   Was there anything else we wanted to mention, Merlin?
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:02.880]   Oh, gosh, no.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880]   That's the thing we wanted to talk about.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.880]   I thought there was something we wanted to talk about.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.560]   Stop by the Merlin Show.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.760]   Go subscribe on the iTunes so I can catch up with that Terry
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.520]   Gross.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.720]   That's what I really wanted to talk about.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.680]   That bitch.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.160]   I hate that Terry Gross.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.920]   And by the way, Leo, it's BSW broadcast supply worldwide,
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.640]   just to be--
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.240]   Oh, it used to be West, but now it's worldwide.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.800]   Like 1,000 years ago.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.120]   Yeah, well, I'm an old timer.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.480]   I remember when her broadcast supply was.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.480]   I've been buying stuff from them since then and nonstop.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.320]   I think they're the best in the business.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.560]   I think that shows what a good customer you are, Leo.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.880]   Yeah, because I remember their old name.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.280]   Yeah, it's bswusa.com.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.520]   Am I right?
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.240]   You are right.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.760]   See, I even know the web address.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   Buy hot.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.240]   What else?
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.440]   Oh, well, the radio show, Merlin,
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.120]   appears on that regularly, which is wonderful.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.160]   Talking about productivity was so funny last week.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.200]   Scott, you know, I think we're going
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.760]   to do an ant phase segment with you.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.520]   I'm ready.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.160]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.320]   All you have to do is let me know.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.320]   Yeah, well, let's start with this.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.400]   Now that we're going to be on it.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.360]   We're going to be on XM.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.280]   So that's really got me.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   Yeah, channel 152, Saturdays and Sundays.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.520]   At 2 p.m. Eastern time, both days, 2 to 5 p.m.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.280]   They're taking all six hours of the show, which I'm thrilled about.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.480]   And then repeating it at 8 o'clock in the evening, 8 to 11
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.200]   Saturday and Sunday.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.640]   Well, you know, my ant phase is a real person.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.880]   She's in her 80s, and she's probably
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.800]   the most technology proficient 80-year-old on the planet.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.280]   And she really gives me all the ideas I get.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.400]   Well, let's do-- because we do some free file stuff.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.920]   And you would all be Mac, right?
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.880]   I'm sorry, ant phase on the right team.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.400]   So yeah.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.320]   No, that's fine, because that would be ant phase Mac's picks.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.600]   It's a little hard to say, but we'll do that.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.080]   And she said if we gave her $3 because she's union,
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.320]   she might even appear on the show.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.920]   I would love to hear from ant phase.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.760]   I think that'd be really fun.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.720]   Really, really fun.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.440]   Thank you, guys.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.920]   Now, how do we end this show again,
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.680]   because I keep forgetting?
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.640]   How do we do that, Scott?
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.120]   As we say, it's in the can.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.080]   It's a-- it broke.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.840]   We're sorry.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.440]   What does it we say?
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.320]   We're so sorry.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.840]   I think we're so very sorry.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.240]   It's a great way to-- and here, let me--
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:05.720]   I think we--
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.320]   Turn on for size.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.040]   That's it for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.200]   We'll see you next week.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.320]   We're so very, very sorry.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.560]   I got-- and yeah, I got to send you something.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.080]   And I got-- in the days when this kind of stuff actually
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.640]   did kind of bug me more, like actually got under my skin more,
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.880]   I did up on one of my first 42 floors podcast,
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.640]   was responding to fake voicemail messages
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.280]   that I'd made up for people.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.920]   And it was all stuff like, I'm not
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.520]   going to sit around all day and listen to your potty
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.040]   and my potty mouth about what I do and do what
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.760]   I need to do with a quicksilver.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.040]   I thank you very much.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.840]   I can take my go to another web moolock
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.040]   and it was how to treat a lady.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.280]   And there's one out there from exactly the total professor
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.760]   Frank Guy.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.720]   I believe if you listen into this episode 35,
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.280]   it was completely incorrect in the way
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.360]   that you have cited this.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.840]   And actually, the bat thought slash.exe
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.880]   would be much more appropriate, liven.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.960]   Well, I do that a lot.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.520]   I do that a lot in public forums.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.120]   When someone-- when doing Q&A, they--
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.480]   I have a copy of your latest book right here.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.400]   I have an--
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.360]   I take issue with your--
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.400]   they'll say it in a normal voice.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.720]   And I'll interrupt them saying, OK, first of all,
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.200]   if you're going to make a complaint like that,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.760]   you do have to use the nerd voice.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.520]   I will take you seriously, but only if you say the both.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.000]   I even--
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.880]   And then begin your comment with, is it just me?
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.560]   Is it just me or there are a number of problematic assumptions
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.280]   to remain miss?
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.200]   They'll be not hold up to the scientists,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.200]   the standards of rigor and whatnot.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.640]   There's going to be a character, by the way,
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.880]   there's going to be a character eventually.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.400]   We're working on this.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400]   We're going to get the budget for this.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.840]   We're running character on the Merlin show
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.960]   called Brent, your former biggest fan.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.040]   And he's going to be this morbidly obese guy
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.320]   with lots of-- like a huge do-lap and a huge beer.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.520]   And he's going to be shot basically next to a dryer
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.240]   that's running in his mom's basement.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.520]   And he's going to be sitting there typing on his delk
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.120]   and explaining to you everything that you've done wrong.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.600]   And why you've disappointed him so much.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.360]   Brent, your former biggest fan.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
