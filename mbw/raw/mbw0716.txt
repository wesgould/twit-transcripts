[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.800]   And he's here.

[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.280]   Alex is here with lots to talk about.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.440]   Tim Cook's beautiful memo to the staff.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.600]   Mark Zuckerberg's less than memorable response.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.320]   The fixes and iOS and Mac OS to some pretty severe flaws
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.520]   and the future of WWDC.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.920]   Alex has some ideas.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.600]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.480]   where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.880]   And we try to pay no attention to the news
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.600]   from the rest of the world.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800]   Not an easy thing to do.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.200]   I know my pal Ride Ritchie suffering a little bit right now.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.360]   And, Montreal, I could see your posts.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   You're down.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.040]   And I understand it, man.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.640]   I understand.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.520]   I have it so much easier than anybody sacrificing
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.120]   eyes, limbs, or lives right now.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.440]   So I just want to support as many people as I can,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.560]   as much as I can, and how every many ways I can.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.880]   And you're in a country that's marginally more effective.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.280]   I don't know if it is, actually, after what you've told me
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.200]   about Quebec.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   Yeah, Quebec is an anomaly.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.720]   It's a struggle there, too.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   Anyway, really.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   We're COVID-19.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.200]   We're not COVID-19 like we are.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.520]   I mean, first the pandemic, then George Floyd,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.720]   all hell broke loose.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.360]   And now the tanks are going to roll into our nation's cities
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.840]   and states.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.200]   If this was an alternate timeline,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.000]   several of us, or the people we work with,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.840]   would all have been arriving, potentially, if it was this week,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.320]   arriving in San Jose for keynote yesterday.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.080]   Oh, WWE.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.240]   Very strange world.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400]   It's a very strange world we live in.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.120]   If not for COVID.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.720]   Actually, we'll talk about WWDC in a second,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.080]   but let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.120]   Andy Enoco also joining us from his bunker.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.320]   Somewhere deep within the confines of New England.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.720]   Good to see you.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.840]   We have water access.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.360]   If we have to escape, that's a good place to--
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.600]   Newfoundland is a very, very long swim,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.520]   but if things get any worse, I'm going to change it.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.080]   Did they close the tunnel to Newfoundland?
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.960]   I thought you guys could just walk.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   If there is a tunnel to Newfoundland,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   and I haven't been told about it,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.840]   I'm going to be pretty cross with a lot of people.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.400]   It's a long walk.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   Also--
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.440]   We'll get you out, Andy.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.720]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.360]   There should be a tunnel to Newfoundland.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.960]   I think there should be a--
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.680]   I'm willing to start one.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   The great Newfoundland tunnel, I think it's a project.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.480]   It's got to be--
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.320]   It's got to be a half as interesting episode.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.080]   Like the tunnel that goes through the Bering Strait
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.880]   to Alaska, if it rushed into Alaska, that's never been built.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.360]   There just got to be one of those worries.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400]   Also with us, Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.240]   If anybody is in an evil mountain lair, it's Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.720]   He is--
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   I'm surprised he doesn't have a sliding mountain
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.160]   door on his fortress of solitude.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.520]   No, no, it's pretty-- we're just pretty far out.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.840]   So it's pretty pretty--
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   It's all like the moon screen, everything.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.560]   It's all virtual.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's all--
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.600]   Exactly.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   There's actually no house.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   I'm sitting in a--
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.560]   Alex has been in Mars for a generation.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   Parking lot.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.640]   He's been living on potatoes for the last 16 years.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.520]   By the way, Steve Carell, have you watched Space Force yet?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.560]   I tried.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   It wasn't me.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.920]   It wasn't for me.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.800]   It wasn't for you.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   I ended up on Mythic-- I ended up on Mythic Quest,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.200]   and I enjoyed myself.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.760]   Oh, really?
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.560]   I did--
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.120]   Finally, thanks to you, I think,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.240]   watched the additional episode of Mythic Quest
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   that they recorded using Zoona.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240]   That was really well done.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   That was the best episode of Mythic Quest.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.280]   It was-- the weird fifth episode,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.880]   it has nothing to do with removals.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   That was--
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   With Removals, if anybody was--
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.520]   What was that, by the way?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.160]   Who were those people?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.520]   They were the people who owned the studio before they--
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   There was an I in--
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   There wasn't an I in--
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   It wasn't anybody in the current times.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   No.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   It was just two men--
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   No, I didn't--
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   Game developers who fell in love at a rec,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   at a movie store 20 years ago, and created a game studio,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   and then that was it.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   Well, and they started with Montreal,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.520]   which then funded them, became a huge game funder,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   and then Mythic Quest was funded by Montreal.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   So I'm guessing it was Ubisoft.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   Like, I don't think they nailed or not.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   Right.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   And then they had the facilities and the income
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   to fund Mythic Quest.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   I just didn't get into Mythic Quest at all,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   but I had to say, you're right, the fifth episode,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   and that last--
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   which was an afterthought.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   Rob McElenney, is that his name?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   40 iPhones and 20 pairs of earphones.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   They called Apple and said, I got this idea.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   I know the season's over.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   They only did nine.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   But we could do a tense.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   Just sent us iPhones and the earpods.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   And we talked about this last week, and I hadn't watched it.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   You recommended it, and it was--
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.520]   And Craig Mason got involved somehow,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   and then just who did--
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   was the Russian nuclear--
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   Chernobyl.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   Chernobyl.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   He's actually on the show as well as consulting on the show.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   He plays the new--
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.520]   the new music studio.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.520]   He plays the new-- the new tester, the new video game tester.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   Oh, that's him in the middle?
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   Yeah, that's Craig Mason.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   Yeah, he's a producer of Chernobyl and the consulting producer
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   on this show, and he actually got involved and was--
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   he did the whole-- yeah, I won't ruin it, but it's hilarious.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   Oh, the end is--
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   --spectacular.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   Yes.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   If you like, OK, go, you'll love the final scene.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   It's really--
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   And if you've ever worked in the industry or tangentially to the industry,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   it's not as far-- the show is not as far-fetched as it might seem.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520]   No kidding.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   No kidding.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   Anyway, condolences to all of our friends all over the world who are,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   you know, suffering through the pandemic and then to our friends in the United States,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   especially our black friends who are suffering even more these days.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.520]   It's been a really rotten week.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   And what can I say?
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   You know, we decided-- I thought briefly about blacking out the home music industry
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   is blacked out.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   It's a fact you go to iTunes right now.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   Actually, Apple's response is kind of interesting.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.520]   Is it the same in Canada?
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   It might just be here in the US, I don't know.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   But if you go to Beats One, it redirects you to a channel featuring African-American music.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.520]   And then if you try to listen to a song by white people that was originally by a black artist,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   they redirect you, right?
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   They redirect you to the black artist.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   Hmm.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   It's an interesting--
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   That's the same in Canada.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Yeah, it is.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   Okay.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   And this is right on the front page of Apple Music if you just open it up.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   Instead, fast support of the black voices that define music, creativity and culture we use ours,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   this moment calls upon us all to speak and act against racism and injustice of all kinds.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   We stand in solidarity with black communities everywhere.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   Hashtag, the show must be paused, and that's what the music industry is doing on this Tuesday.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.680]   And hashtag #blacklivesmatter, which I've been informed, Mike told me, not to use that on
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.520]   your social media posts for the pause.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520]   Yes.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.760]   Because we don't want to junk up the important Black Lives Matter feed at this time with
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.000]   just blank screens and things.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.760]   And then if you press the Listen Together button, you get a special black-focused beats radio
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   station.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   I've got Solange on right now.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   So that's, I think, cool.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.760]   Tim Cook also said a memo.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:57.640]   I mean, it feels like we're dealing with multiple-- this timeline's getting worse, Renee.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.000]   Can you please get us out of it?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'm trying.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.560]   Tim Cook, Zack and Adela, most of the big tech companies, I think a little bit Amazon, a
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.480]   lot Facebook are the big exceptions.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   But the other companies seem to really be stepping up and trying to use whatever they
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   can as a platform.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.080]   Microsoft has been outstanding to try to bring people as much together as they can.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.360]   Well, and that's why it's a little weird that Facebook-- in fact, Facebook's staff is
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.800]   getting more and more irate at Mark Zuckerberg's unwillingness to do it.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   They're quitting on that.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   They're quitting on that.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   They're leaving.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:44.560]   It's pretty disgusting, especially when it's-- you'd like to have leaders of these quasi-governmental
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.920]   scale tech companies in scale and power.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   You'd like them to do the right thing on their own.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.080]   You would also think that they're smart enough that when they see that every single one of
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.880]   the other tech companies that are operating at that same scale have also stepped up to
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.040]   one degree or another.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.880]   You've lost the ability to say, "Well, we feel as though it's not our responsibility
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.480]   to end really the signature phrase in any statement from Facebook."
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.200]   It's not our responsibility.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.080]   We're not responsible.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.320]   So yeah, this is as much as--
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   Right.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.640]   They ban male-- female nipples, not male nipples, but female nipples.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   There are some things we will ban.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.960]   It's the other thing we won't.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:32.000]   It's difficult if you ban anything, it's difficult to say, "Well, we should ban this and not this."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.600]   I think what Zuckerberg wants to do is say, "We're a platform not responsible for any
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.000]   content on the platform."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.960]   In a way, I understand that this is something Twitter has been trying to do for years and
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.160]   years and years.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.480]   It is very challenging.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.920]   It's very difficult because everybody agrees there's a line.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.200]   You're not going to have terrorist organizing and recruitment groups on Facebook.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.760]   There's a line.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.760]   The argument is, "Where is the line?"
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.240]   And as soon as you say, "There is a line," that's when it really becomes difficult.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:12.040]   I think the issue with Zuckerberg is not that you can argue, you can have a relativistic,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.200]   almost inhuman argument about the morality of those two positions, but he's not consistent.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.240]   He is completely not consistent about it.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.160]   He's completely hypocritical about it.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.800]   At the same time, all these documents are leaking showing that Facebook was told that
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.880]   the more extremism they promoted, the bigger their platform would become, and they chose
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.480]   to embrace the extremism.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:38.520]   This whole background paints what—again, you can never believe what people say.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   People will say anything.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   They will wrap themselves in any trappings, conduct any theater.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.880]   All you can do is see judges and by what their actions and their inactions, and both
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:54.800]   his actions and inactions, are fairly horrific picture about what a tech company can be in
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   the wrong hands.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:03.480]   Comparing contrast to what Twitter did, where not two days after causing a ruckus by saying,
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.840]   okay, while the president lied about mail-in voting, we're just going to put a link underneath
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.040]   it says, get the facts about mail-in voting.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.680]   That doesn't say the president is lying.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.240]   It says, "Myer are the fact."
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.640]   It says, "Myer are the puke as you could do."
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.840]   >> And of course, it sent Trump into an immediate executive order because this isn't something
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.760]   that really, really matters to him.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.400]   But in the face of that, in that environment where the ink was still wet on this executive
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.800]   order, Twitter said, okay, you know what, this tweet about when the shooting starts,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   the shooting starts, this is off the rails crazy.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.440]   This is inciting violence.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.880]   We are now at the point where we are leaving this up so everybody can see exactly what
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.960]   this man is saying.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.280]   But we are labeling that this is something that would immediately get a user banned for inciting
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.360]   violence.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.680]   This is pulling the tiger's tail and not caring.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.800]   This is bravery.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.040]   This is the opposite of what Facebook is doing, which is it is a problem we have to figure
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.360]   out as a service like Facebook or like YouTube or like Twitter where you're allowing people
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.080]   to speak on your dime to figure out at what point should you exert control over what's
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.760]   said, but what Zuckerberg is doing saying, the easiest thing for us to do is nothing
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   at all.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.600]   And not only that, but we're going to take that as something we should be praised for.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:33.320]   This man needs to go someplace and think about what he's doing to this world.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.600]   >> And his speech with the civil liberties people yesterday was also fairly non-heartening.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.000]   >> I also did the civil rights organizations that met with Zuckerberg said his speech
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.240]   explanations were "incomprehensible."
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.880]   >> Because they're not true.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.160]   And it's very hard to keep that many lies, even if you're lying to yourself.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.960]   It's very hard to keep that many lies bouncing around your head at the same time.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   >> Go ahead, Alex.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.840]   >> I think the fundamental thing we need to take away is that we shouldn't believe anything
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.520]   that we see anywhere.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.800]   And like not on its face value, there should be no single point of truth.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   There isn't any sort of thing.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.940]   >> But Alex said it more to the power.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.940]   >> No, I'm not.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   >> I'm not left.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.940]   >> Here we have.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   >> I'm saying it.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   >> I agree with you.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.940]   >> Yeah, I mean.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   >> I agree with you.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.940]   >> I agree with you.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.220]   So I'm not disagreeing with that, but we have to keep on telling our kids, like my kids
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.940]   get it almost constantly.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.060]   Like don't believe anything that you see.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.140]   Until you see it three or four different places that agree to it, until you've cross-checked
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.820]   it and it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't exist.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.980]   Until something, we used to say that until something exists in three places when we were
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:38.220]   making copies of files, until something exists in three places, it doesn't exist.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.300]   In my case with news, until I've heard it from a whole bunch of different places that
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   don't agree with each other on a day-to-day basis, I think about it very rarely.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.300]   >> It's really easy.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.380]   >> That's mainstream news.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.700]   >> I think that's minimized the risk because it's very easy to, I went back to Facebook
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.900]   during COVID, which I regret and I'm going to immediately take out.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:06.900]   But it's very easy to get the same misguided viewpoint from what looks like three good
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.900]   sources.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.060]   >> It's very persuasive.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:16.300]   >> If I pick, when I'm saying three disagreeing to sources, so if I see something on CNN,
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:23.100]   Fox, NPR, Al Jazeera, whatever they agree on is probably somewhere near the truth.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.020]   Everything else is their own opinion about that and we just have to, you have to take
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.460]   things- >> Really now going down the universe of
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.460]   truth there, Alex.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.980]   >> Well, no, no, I'm just giving that as an example.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.940]   I mean, I don't think you could get those five sources to agree on the fact that Elon
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.540]   Musk launched a rocket last week.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.140]   >> That's why we came up this morning.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.980]   >> Again, they'll agree on the basic facts.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.020]   They won't agree on what those facts mean.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:53.100]   And so the thing is is that, and even then, I take everything with the grain of salt.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.180]   I'm not saying that Facebook and Twitter don't need to do more work on what they're doing.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.740]   I'm saying that they're never going to fix it ever.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   >> I agree.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.740]   >> And the thing that the idea that we think that somehow they're going to fix this someday
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.220]   or they should fix it is Pollyanna.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   It is a pipe dream.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.340]   Like it is never going to happen.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.300]   What's important is for our education.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.620]   And they should keep doing that.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.180]   I'm not disagreeing with you that they shouldn't take more responsibility and that they need
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.180]   it.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.700]   They've got, they're in a big mess and they don't know how to get out of it.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.540]   And they're not going to get out of it anytime soon.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.820]   And it's never going to be right because the news hasn't been right for most of our lifetime
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.060]   or all of our lifetime.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.180]   I mean, I'm in the middle of the news.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.980]   Like serving them files and putting all this stuff in and looking at all this stuff.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.860]   They're not right half the time.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.380]   And so the thing is, is that we just have to understand that we have this thing like we
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.740]   should believe everything.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.220]   We should be able to take it as a trusted source.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.460]   Nothing is a trusted source.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.020]   >> So the one thing that's right after that is we have things we are.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.020]   This is our opinion.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.020]   This is our discussion about what that looks like.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.060]   >> The only thing I'd add to that is that we have absolutely unprecedented access to primary
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   sources.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.460]   I don't have to trust the reporting of anybody.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.740]   I can see what most people are saying directly on Twitter.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.060]   And that alone is so horrifying.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.460]   >> And I think it's part of what's undermined our belief in the press.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.660]   I mean, there's been a lot of rhetoric.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.700]   But I think it's also because we don't have to believe them.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.780]   We can see things that very quickly that go against whatever they're saying.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.340]   Whether it's liberal or conservative or whatever.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.260]   And I think that we just have to really understand that as a society, we have to become very.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.700]   And I think that it's healthy for us to become very untrusting of everything that comes
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.020]   out of everybody's mouth.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.420]   And research it and think about it and be critical about it.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.820]   And these, all these services, including the news, needs to be better at it.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.780]   >> I think the end of that attitude is QAnon.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.780]   >> I don't think so.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.100]   >> Yeah, there's a lot of people who say, I don't trust anything.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.380]   I'm going to do my own research.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.140]   In fact, that's by the way, the motto of QAnon.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.140]   Do the research.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140]   >> And Facebook, apparently.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.780]   Because they're trending stories have nothing to do with the reality of what we saw.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.820]   >> Where are you going to get these original sources if you don't get them through the
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.820]   media?
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]   Do you have some magical system?
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.940]   >> I just listened to a lot of news from a lot of different sources that, again, are
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.740]   almost diametrically opposed.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.740]   >> I agree.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   That's a good process.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.500]   >> You're listening to the same, like if you're really into MSNBC or really into Fox,
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.180]   you're not going to know what's going on.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.140]   You have to listen to all of them to some degree.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.820]   Now, there's something I can listen to more than others.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:29.140]   But I also, when you listen to all of that, I can listen to something knowing that it's
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.100]   a conservative filter or knowing that it's a liberal filter.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.380]   I can listen through it and I can hear the words that they're using, literally the words
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.980]   that they're using are specifically liberal or conservative because they'll term something
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.180]   in a very specific way.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.100]   So inside of that, I'm constantly breaking down every piece of news that I look at.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   As soon as you say something.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.740]   >> Do you think everybody can do that?
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.620]   >> No, I don't think everybody can do it.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.980]   But I'm saying that it is a skill that we need to be working on.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.980]   Not everybody can write either.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.300]   It doesn't mean that we don't teach them how to write.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.580]   But I think that we're not going to fix it.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.700]   I think that for us to think that somehow we're going to fix the social networks so that they're
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.020]   suddenly true, the news isn't that good either.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.580]   So the thing is is that the social networks are never going to get fixed.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.900]   So we have to be thinking about from a personal accountability perspective with our kids,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.980]   with ourselves.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.060]   We have to start approaching it that way.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.580]   I'm not saying that it's going to fix it.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.780]   >> What's the bias of Facebook?
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.380]   What filter do you apply to Facebook?
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.380]   >> Chaos.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.700]   I mean, it's not, I don't think it's one.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.380]   I don't think that Facebook is money.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.380]   >> No, I think we don't.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.980]   I think we actually don't know because there is an algorithm.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.740]   That news feed is very algorithmic.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   It's more out of it.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.740]   >> Isn't it simple though?
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.980]   They want our, they convert attention into money so they will do absolutely anything to
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   get them out of the tent.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.700]   >> I think possible to make the most money possible.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.940]   >> And I'm not, we're going to end the conversation pretty soon because it's not really our beat.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.620]   But I think honestly, we don't know what Facebook's algorithms biases are.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.380]   I think you could say they're biased towards engagement.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.780]   I'm not fully convinced that's the case.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.300]   >> Oh, I think, I think they're biased in trying to, it's view time.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:09.060]   So they're biased on how long, based on what you're looking at and what you seem to like,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.340]   what can I give you more of in that area?
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.740]   >> How can I extract more information from you?
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.940]   It's like classic group marketing on Hulk's era.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.300]   >> It's not, I don't think it has a, that part.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.900]   I don't think the algorithm has any real bias one way or the other.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:31.020]   I think that I think Facebook as a group is, as a, as a, as a set of people are probably,
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.340]   you know, as a group is probably more liberal than conservative.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.980]   >> Oh, I disagree.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.980]   I disagree.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.140]   Mark Zuckerberg is on the phone with President Trump on Friday.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.340]   I completely disagree.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.780]   >> And Peter Thiel is on his board.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.780]   >> Peter Thiel is on the board.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.140]   And I think you could very clearly, one of the reasons that Trump was anxious to send
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.860]   your Twitter and not Facebook is President Trump knows that his campaign will be using
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.660]   Facebook heavily as it did last time.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.740]   Brad Parscale is a master of Facebook.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.740]   I disagree.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.180]   I don't think it's immediately obvious what, what Mark Zuckerberg's interests are.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.820]   >> You could refuse to take money for political ads and refuse to allow your, your social
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:10.220]   graph to be targeted for political or opinion based marketing.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.580]   And that would probably remove a lot of the danger.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.260]   >> I think it's actually simplistic to say he's just after the money.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.380]   He's made a lot of money, he didn't need the money now.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.540]   >> That's true.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:26.300]   >> I think, no, I think that he's an example of what happens when somebody makes an ungodly,
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.900]   and I mean the word ungodly amount of money and it crews an ungodly amount of power before
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.380]   they spend any time in the real world without that kind of money.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.380]   >> I agree.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.380]   >> Without that kind of power.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:44.540]   Because it basically, it's an apotheotic sort of moment where you believe that the reason
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.660]   why Facebook is a success is because I have God like powers.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.580]   I understand things the way that few people in this world do.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:58.260]   And therefore, if I say that this is how, that Facebook is not a damaging influence
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.580]   upon the world and that we're not doing bad things for bad things with our product, then
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.380]   obviously it's, obviously all these people who are complaining just don't understand
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.540]   the world the way I do.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.180]   I think he's an arrogant SOB.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:17.780]   And I think that the idea of having no limits on his accountability is not the way to go.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.060]   >> And having said all that, it's still intractable.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.060]   I agree with Alex and the ones thing, and he's never going to get fixed.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.500]   >> It's not, no, yeah, but that doesn't mean that we don't build cars with seat belts
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.980]   and airbags and crunkle zones.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:36.060]   We're not going to stop people from getting killed, but we can do something to mitigate
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.060]   the damage or at least document the damage.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.300]   So we are aware of the influence that this sort of thing is having on us collectively.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:49.900]   >> So compare and contrast Mark Zuckerberg's response with Tim Cook's memo, which I thought
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   was beautiful.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.740]   And here's an example of a guy who is the opposite, I think, Andy, his guy who grew up
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.180]   in the real world, right?
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:04.420]   And he may be very wealthy now, but I don't think it's colored his perception of the world.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.780]   And he's not founder, he's not founder wealthy.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.260]   And he came, he grew up in a time in a place where he wasn't even accepted.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.380]   So it's great.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.860]   And also in a time when Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King and people were hugely
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.860]   influential.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.860]   >> Yep.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.500]   He wrote, "Team, this is the memo he sent to everybody in Apple.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.140]   Right now there is a pain deeply etched in the soul of our nation and in the hearts of
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:30.300]   millions to stand together who must stand up for one another and recognize the fear,
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.780]   hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.860]   longer history of racism."
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.900]   We've seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it's similarly true the communities
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.060]   of color continue to endure discrimination and trauma.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.660]   I've heard from so many of you that feel afraid.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.340]   We can have no society worth celebrating unless we guarantee freedom from fear for every person
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.540]   who gives this country their love, love, labor, and life.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.900]   Apple our mission has and always will be to create technology that empowers people to
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.700]   change the world for the better.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.140]   But together we must do more today.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.900]   Apple's making donations to a number of groups.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.620]   I'm editing as we go along by the way.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.140]   There's a lot more.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.780]   Including the Equal Justice Initiative and nonprofit committed to challenging racial injustice.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.260]   For the month of June and in honor of the June Teen's holiday we'll also be matching
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.220]   two for one all employee donations to Benevity.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.340]   But this is also a compare and contrast with Steve Jobs who to our knowledge never once
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.300]   contributed to a charity and certainly not.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.820]   My understanding is he did, but his philosophy, his face philosophy was different.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.820]   He did not believe, he had this theory that you should not pimp your charity or removed
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.980]   the motivation for the charity where Tim Cook feels that if you don't then you fail to
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980]   inspire others.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.300]   And it's one of their biggest differences.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   Yep.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   Yep.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.740]   But he also did not make it easy as an employee of Apple as I understand it to participate
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   either.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:07.940]   I mean this is, Apple has set up all of these processes for employees to donate and participate.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.220]   He goes on, "This is a moment when many people may want, and this one is I think important
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:18.500]   for all of us, many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy or a status
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.780]   quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.860]   As difficult as it may be to admit that desire is itself a sign of privilege.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.300]   George Floyd's death is shocking and tragic proof we must aim far higher than a normal
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.980]   future and build one that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice."
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:44.540]   Very powerful stuff from Tim Cook and beautifully written, beautifully said, just inspiring to
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.060]   be honest.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:53.380]   So well done.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.540]   There is news.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:03.980]   But you know, this is a challenge for us on all the shows of how I know that for many
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.220]   we're an escape from reality, that we all want that normalcy that Tim was talking about.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.740]   But I think we also have to acknowledge the world we're in and the pain that we're all
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.380]   many of us in.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.900]   And I don't think we should bury that either.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.460]   But we are going to talk about Apple in other ways as well.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.180]   In fact, we all got an update, didn't we?
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.460]   A suddenly an update to 13.5, which we had gotten days earlier.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.740]   I bet you you know, Renee, is this the fix to the jailbreak?
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   Yeah, so I mean, it depends on how you want to look at it because a lot of people who
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.060]   jailbreak will just see this as Apple ruining their fun or people who are amateur researchers
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.860]   will look at it as Apple closing down their ability to do amateur research where people
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.460]   on the, like maybe the info sec or maybe on Apple side will say that, you know, this
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.300]   vulnerability has been exposed.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.220]   And while jailbreaking is fairly benign, there are people who are going to use these
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.740]   exploits for much more dangerous things.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.180]   And it'd be responsible just to leave them in the wild.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.060]   It breaks the jailbreak, right?
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.060]   I believe so.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.540]   I haven't personally tested it, but that's what I heard people saying.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:20.580]   I might be wrong, but I believe that's what the current chatter was.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.380]   13.5.1.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.620]   There may be other things in there, but the fact that it came so quickly on the heels
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:33.140]   of 13.5, although Alex, you've always said, do not install the first update.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.180]   In fact, you say don't install the second update, right?
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.700]   I usually try to stay an update behind if I can, but mostly you just let it, especially
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.060]   when updates come out, you don't just go, I'm going to immediately jump on that one.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.660]   You usually want to let that sit and stew for a couple of days or maybe a week, especially
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.820]   if you're in any kind of production.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.020]   You want to just kind of like let it sit there for a second and see if anybody finds
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.300]   anything before you jump on it.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.060]   In production, of course, when we're in like a film production or a large production, we
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.300]   won't update anything for a year, two years.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.380]   I came out of Star Wars and I had a whole bunch of apps that didn't even look the same
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.900]   as I was working in because you don't want anything to change.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.460]   But at a home environment, I would say that we update things pretty late.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.980]   We let things kind of figure their way out.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.300]   Our premiere, our editor's machines, I don't know what version of Windows 10 there are,
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.660]   but it ain't the current one.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660]   That's for sure.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.660]   Right.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.260]   Yeah, once you get it, especially once you've hit first.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.900]   Yeah, well, update yourself.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.220]   Yeah, yeah, let us know.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.220]   Yeah, it works.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.460]   Once you find a stable one, then the thing is you, I look at everything of like the new
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.780]   update, I always look at what are the new features.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.180]   Is that something I really need?
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.340]   And then I start thinking about it.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.100]   But if it's not something that I really need, I'm like, I'll just wait.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.900]   Mine works just fine right now.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   It's not new.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.900]   You wait.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.900]   That's the goal, right?
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.900]   It's not the new emoji.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.900]   You got to wait.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.740]   Yeah, I got to have the emoji.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.260]   Apple makes it so difficult to downgrade.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:59.380]   If you realize that upgrading your device or your computer was a horrendous mistake
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.300]   and you wish, wish, wish that Superman would fly in reverse around the planet and make
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.460]   your computer work the way it did yesterday before you did that awful thing, i.e. click
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.900]   that button that Apple really, really decided that you should be clicking.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:20.020]   Apple makes it so hard for you to revert to a previous version of the OS that you really
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.500]   do have to be that careful about it.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.660]   I still, on my Macs, I still have not upgraded to the latest OS because-
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.660]   Really?
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   You got-
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.100]   It's all too tough stuff you want to keep.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   Well, it's chiefly because everything that I'm using works great.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:44.940]   I'm aware that it's not so much the 32-bit stuff that could break so much as requiring
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:51.220]   updates to some old apps that I have that may or may not actually function in this new
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.740]   version of the OS.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:59.140]   And basically, unfortunately, Apple kind of spent its- it kind of lost its double-A
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:05.660]   bond gold rating in terms of software updates a while ago where it used to be- it really
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.140]   did used to be the gold standard where it just upgrades.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.620]   They've tested it really, really well.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.660]   They're not going to be any really big showstoppers at this point in the testing process.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.300]   Give it a week, but after a week when there's nothing in the news about how hard drives
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.940]   got reformatted or anything like that, go right ahead.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:28.060]   Now it really is, unless you have- unless you can set up an entire separate Mac with
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:33.300]   the new operating system, do a complete restore of a backup on your primary work machine on
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.940]   this and make sure that every single app that you count on absolutely works, whether
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:44.100]   it's signed or unsigned, then you really have to be very, very careful about making that
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   decision.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.940]   Well, then you probably don't care that Apple also updated Catalina yesterday.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:54.740]   10.15.5 supplemental update security update 2020-003.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.940]   The last Sierra update came out for Catalina and I guess High Sierra.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:09.300]   What I love about this, if you look at the Apple release about what was patched, an application
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.500]   may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, a memory consumption issue
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.060]   that was impressed with the improved memory handling, and uncover.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.220]   Which that's the jailbreak.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.940]   But why would they patch that in Mac OS?
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:29.540]   Did you need it if you wanted Mac OS to take advantage of it?
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.660]   I don't know for sure, but it could also be that there's shared code that, it could be
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.260]   code in anything that they need to patch that's shared between the two systems.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.180]   Ever since they established a core OS team, that team builds a lot of things that are
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.980]   both everything from APFS to so much of the stuff is shared code now that if there's a
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   flaw in one, it's worth patching it in another.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.860]   So here's the installation guide.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:32:01.100]   You do have to use the Mac it looks like in uncover and then connect iOS via USB.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:07.940]   So to install Alt Store, there's several ways to do this.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:15.140]   So I guess that's part of why uncover is in the security update, CVE 2020-9859.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:21.780]   It's not the only security fly Apple apparently paid a researcher a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.060]   Not the highest bug bounty, but a pretty good size, good chunk of a bug bounty for a sign
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.420]   in with Apple bug.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.900]   Bob Oak Jane got the bug bounty because he discovered it and did the right thing, which
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:45.620]   is went to Apple instead of saving it for Pwnown or something, which I'd be tempted to do.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:51.780]   Jane said the vulnerability that he discovered resided in the way Apple was validating a
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:58.540]   user on the client side before initiating a request from Apple's authentication servers.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:10.220]   So there's a token and this JSON web token JWT could be stolen, I gather, and use to authorize
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.340]   somebody else.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.980]   Basically the server was not verifying that the person requesting the token was the same
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.540]   ID as the ID that was being used to log in.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.300]   So basically it could present one set of credentials and receive another Apple ID could
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:35.060]   then receive that token and basically get all the permissions and get all the ID authentication
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.780]   that was coming to the original user.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.020]   You could forge JWT basically.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.820]   And thereby do anything you want.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.340]   Anyway, it's fixed.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.020]   That's a bit of a problem.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.020]   It's fixed.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.260]   We could talk about it now because Apple gave them the money.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.540]   And I believe there was no instance of it actually happening.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.340]   No, yeah, it was a zero day or it wasn't a zero day.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.860]   It was prevented from being a zero day.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.380]   So this is why you pay a bug bounty.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.580]   You want these guys to do that.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:09.220]   And because it's such a competitive market these days for exploits, there's so much
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:15.900]   money to be made from both legitimate people, including the company that you're exploiting
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:22.100]   and illegitimate people who want those exploits to sell them to nation states, the people
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.820]   who sell them to governments in the states.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.220]   Or perhaps they should sweeten the deal by also offering them a mug.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.620]   That's only available to the county people.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.860]   Or just like a T-shirt.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.100]   Yeah, limited edition challenge.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   Challenge coin.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   They need to send them.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100]   They have an Apple challenge coin.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.100]   That's a good idea.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.260]   That would be a lot of people would.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.140]   How'd you get that challenge coin?
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.300]   Oh, I found a bug in iOS.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:53.780]   I decided not to bring the entire fake system down and watch the world burn out.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.780]   I fixed open SL.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.540]   I just fixed that big deal.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   That big deal.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   Let's say a little break.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:06.500]   And then I do want to talk about WWDC, which we would be fondly enjoying right now, but
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.100]   we'll be soon in a different way.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.060]   And what they might announce, including iOS 14, some news about that, at least a rumor
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.660]   about that coming out.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:21.980]   Our show today brought to you by Epson and those great eco tank printers as many of us
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.940]   work from home or have to teach our kids at home.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.020]   And you need a nice printer, but you call her right, but you have to worry about running
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.020]   out of ink.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   Where are you going to get an ink cartridge these days?
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.780]   You want to make sure you have the right printer.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.140]   It's the one we have at home, the Epson Eco Tank.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.500]   It makes it easy.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.180]   These super tank printers have super sized, easy to fill tanks.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.820]   And they come with a ridiculous amount of ink when you buy them.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.540]   They'll have to print thousands of pages in most cases a couple of years.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.900]   I'm still using that first set of ink bottles.
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:00.660]   But when you do need to replace it, those easy color-coded ink bottles make it very simple
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.660]   to refill.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.940]   And then you get another couple of years, more thousands more pages.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.140]   There's Shaq marveling at the ink bottle refill.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.100]   He really is enjoying the refilling of the ink bottle on that website there.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.260]   No more rushing the store to replace an ink cartridge in between print jobs.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.860]   Actually, when I got the Eco Tank, I think I bought a second set because I figured, well,
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.020]   now I'll have four years.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.620]   Kiss expensive ink cartridges goodbye because Eco Tank is changing the way people print.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.300]   Go ahead print all your work reports, your task lists.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.900]   Do those kids assignments in color?
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.500]   They're going to wow the teacher.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.580]   Eco Tank makes it easy.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:43.980]   So add it to your online shopping list so you too can like Shaq just fill and chill.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.700]   He's a very sweet guy.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.700]   I got to say.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.700]   But he's big.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   He's scary.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.940]   He makes that printer look kind of tiny.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.060]   Check out the Epson Eco Tank printers.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.700]   You'll find them at Amazon, Dell, Micro Center, and of course, epsin.com/ecotank.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.540]   Leo, E-P-S-O-N.com/ecotank.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.780]   Leo, I've been an epsin user since my first computer with my dot matrix, epsin MX80 printer.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.940]   We've come a long way.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.620]   Let me tell you, I love those epsin Eco Tank.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.620]   I got two of them.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.820]   Epson, exceed your vision.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.300]   Okay.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:30.660]   I like the front page with the MemoGs at WWDC.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.940]   We are going to be all virtual, yes?
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.940]   Yes.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.940]   Do we know anything?
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.940]   Do we know it?
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.940]   Should I download the app?
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.940]   What should I do?
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.580]   If you want to enjoy the work of one Serenity Caldwell, you should absolutely download that
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.580]   app.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.580]   What did Serenity do in the app?
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.660]   Serenity is, I forget her exact title, but she's on the evangelist team and doing content
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.180]   for the developer app.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.780]   So like video content or drawings or?
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.020]   No, like blogging and all sorts of amazing.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.020]   All sorts of amazing stuff.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   So if you've been dying for some Serenity Caldwell, I have.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.020]   I have been.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.820]   We were talking earlier on iOS today how so many people we know have gone to Apple and
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.540]   then just disappeared.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.660]   But it happens, it's just because they're big companies.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:17.140]   We have a number of friends who like Alan Melvantano who've gone to work for Intel and they just
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.300]   then there's Christina Warren who is bigger and brighter than ever.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   Yeah, no kidding me.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   I like that.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   That's a good point.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.060]   Yeah, she's not disappeared within the confines of Microsoft.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.260]   But so many people have gone.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.660]   I mean, I never hear from Nathan Oliver as Giles anymore.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   I don't know.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.660]   I don't know what's going on with him.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.660]   I think Apple.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.580]   Microsoft and Google seem to be very like they seem to have no problem.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.220]   I can't say no problem, but they seem much easier about people podcasting and being on
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.780]   social networks and Apple and some other companies seem to have much more.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.780]   Much more.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.420]   Like I know on the like you can do like a if you work at Apple, you can do like a video
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.580]   game podcast, but like they don't want to be talking about technology just in case.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.580]   Come on to it.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.580]   That's for show.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.220]   Well, it's weird because like when you talk to them, they actually live in the future.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.660]   Like they forget what devices are public or not, what the names of things are better
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   public or not.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.060]   It's just it's awkward for them.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.820]   That's actually why I never do NDAs or embargoes because I can't remember fight when I know
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.300]   and don't know.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.420]   And I want to talk about everything.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.860]   And when you when you have like 20 or 30 hours on the air every week, you pretty much
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   have to talk.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.580]   You have to basically dump every bit of your mind out into the world.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.060]   So it's better that I know better than I shouldn't know.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.060]   Lisa's good.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.220]   She says, I will sign it and I won't tell you.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   Okay.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.460]   Well, you don't know can't hurt her.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.460]   Yes.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.340]   I'm going to get her a T-shirt that says that.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.500]   That's good.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:45.700]   So what the best thing I think about developer conferences going online is we really enjoy
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.540]   Microsoft build.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.980]   Everybody's invited.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.820]   What's normally a very hard ticket to get now is everybody's got one, right?
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.140]   So I don't know if the ticket is hard to get because the, well, I think you have to win
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.020]   one of those little contests to get the demo jackasses here.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.820]   But like Apple for a few years now, Apple's been amazing at posting like live streaming
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.260]   a lot of the stuff, especially after the fact that you're a bit.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.260]   Well, even some of the stuff has been live streamed, like, right?
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.980]   Not just, not just the keynote, but state of the union and whatever has been in that
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.380]   big central hallway has almost always been live.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.860]   And then the rest will be released later.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.220]   And even for the last couple of years, they've had some sessions that were only live to tape.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   Nobody could go to them.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.540]   There were so many sessions, they couldn't fit them on the schedule.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.980]   So they would just come out virtually and you'd have to go and check the listings.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.700]   To see what were the unaired shows were.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.060]   So that part doesn't change.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   It's just like what's interesting to me is some of the biggest value for the people who
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.420]   do get tickets is going to the developer, the design and the app store labs where they
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   can talk to the people who maintain or either road or maintain the code or will give them
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.940]   design reviews or will give them advice about how to sell on the app store.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.420]   And that part, you know, it was famous.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.460]   There's a thousand Apple engineers here and that part doesn't scale.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.580]   And you know, maybe Alex knows how to virtualize that way better than I can imagine.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.620]   But it's hard for me to predict like is it going to be like a zoom call and batches
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.620]   of 300?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.620]   Like I just I don't know how that's going to be.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.780]   Oh, I might know.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.700]   It'll all be on Alex's streaming show every morning.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.700]   You're muted, Alex.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.700]   Oh, sorry.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.660]   The so the thing is is that we're one of the things we really experiment with a lot in
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.060]   the office hours that I do in the mornings is this idea of all of us learning together.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.420]   And the reality is is that what we're finding is is that it's really actually pretty inefficient
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.980]   to talk one on one because and it's something that I someone just asked me to do a talk and
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.740]   I said I can do a talk, but it has to be for 150 people.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.180]   Like I don't want to talk.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.100]   I don't want to have a conversation with less than less than like 10 people or 15 people
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:49.700]   because it's just like it's a lot of time to spend on on, you know, the thing is is that
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:55.340]   what I'm finding is is that when you get to critical mass, you come up with the answers
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   faster.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.660]   You come up with the questions that everybody learns from when you have a big group.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:05.860]   And so it actually is it's actually a faster way to learn is to not have it when you're
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.260]   only you're limited to what that one person's asking.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.460]   But a lot of times them sitting back and watching what someone else is asking will tell them
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.820]   more about what they're doing.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:19.220]   Now you still want to be around a certain subject, but you want it to be this, you know, you
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.540]   want to be able to have this big group of people that are able to, you know, think about it.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.220]   So I think that that whiteboard, you know, Apple has other services, you know, in developer
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.260]   relations there, you can call somebody and set up a meeting and you can have a discussion
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.860]   with an Apple, you know, developer support where they'll sit there and talk to you about
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.100]   your problem the same way those whiteboards work, you know, over the, you know, over the
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.900]   phone, you know, though, or over a face, face time or whatever.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.020]   And so, so you can, that is available all the time.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.260]   I don't know if a lot of developers know that, but that whiteboard experience, not
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.420]   maybe not exactly the whiteboard experience, but having that discussion through the code
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.500]   and walking through those things is always out there, you know, available for people.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.420]   But I think that the hardest part, I think, for Apple is figuring out how do you put engineers
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:07.180]   on a video where they, as Renee talked about, they might say the wrong thing.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.780]   So that's the most difficult part because what we're finding is if you give people challenges,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.820]   like, hey, we're all going to do something together, or if they come and say, just bring
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.860]   their questions, you know, like, again, the office hours that I do every morning, we don't
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.300]   have a format when people come in and they just start asking questions about media and
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.860]   it can be about film, it can be about live, it can be about audio, and there's, you know,
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.100]   a thoughtful discussion about that and everybody learns, because a lot of people don't even
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   know what to ask.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.500]   They don't know what they don't know yet, you know, and so, and so those things start
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:39.820]   to, you know, that conversation starts to kind of solidify that process.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.260]   And so I do think that the future, there's some part of the future is this, this kind
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.700]   of interactive process where you have hundreds or even thousands.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.820]   And I think that the system that I'm using right now would probably start to become not
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.180]   as useful at about 500 to 1000.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.020]   Somewhere in that range it starts to not scale as well.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.980]   But if you're thinking about individual things like, hey, today we're talking about maps.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.820]   Are we really going to get 1000 people to show up for maps?
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.740]   I don't know, you know, so, you know, or quick time or whatever or HLS streaming, you know,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.660]   and I think that there is a way to do that.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.500]   But I think Apple should be doing that every day.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.300]   You know, I think they have it here.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   You just kind of always.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.780]   I think, yeah, I think every day you have a different team and that team only does it
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.780]   once a month.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.300]   You know, the quick time team shows up.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   Once a month.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.300]   Once you do that, that would be so much fun.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.900]   And then basically they come in and they can come in over virtually or whatever.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.580]   And you know, what, and I think most companies should be thinking about something like this,
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.500]   especially now that we don't have the conferences.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.460]   But Apple could have 20, the 20 groups that they want to highlight on and maybe a couple
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.020]   of specials here and there.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.060]   They're all going to come on for an hour or two every month.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.380]   And you can queue up questions and vote questions up as a group and figure out what you're
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.380]   going to ask.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.380]   And then they just go through them.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.740]   They've got a whiteboard and they can do a screen, you know, they can show you their
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.660]   code and they can go through different, those different questions and have a conversation
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.900]   with that audience.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.780]   And now I think overall that along with releasing these videos all the time would be a lot more
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.780]   effective than WWDC.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:07.060]   Like as far as giving you all ongoing support.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.740]   And I think that again, do they not do anything like that?
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.300]   I mean, a lot of open source projects have a discord or an IRC channel.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.300]   Yeah, mailing list.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.660]   Apple's a huge mailing list company.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.660]   Mailing list.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.660]   Okay.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.900]   And I know the interactivity, I agree with you, Alex is really great.
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:28.660]   And I think that there's something about it that we're finding that is we're finding
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.780]   that there's something about the discussion process that we're getting, you know, with
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.860]   what we're doing in office hours that is this interactive conversation.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.420]   You get a bunch of smart people, you know, that are that are able to talk.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.780]   It's not like, for instance, it's not just one or two people.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.780]   There's a.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   You build on one another.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.380]   And everyone's building in someone, someone, someone else is an expert in that area and
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.460]   they're able to jump in and have that conversation.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.780]   And, and the thing is, is that, you know, the, we, we keep on thinking about, oh, we
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.940]   can't do the conference anymore.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.420]   Well, the other thing is, is when you get rid of those conferences that have been here
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.140]   for years, I mean, that needed to be here for a long time before we had Zoom and other,
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.580]   other tools like it.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.900]   The, you know, we're no longer now constrained by time and space.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.820]   You know, we don't have to have it all happen in a really short period of time and we don't
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.740]   have to have it all in one little place.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.140]   You know, and because of that, we don't have to have multiple tracks.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.060]   We can spread it all out because the thing is, is that everyone knows that by the end
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.900]   of this conference, your brain is numb.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.700]   The stuff that you see on Thursday and Friday, you barely remember because you've absorbed
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.220]   some more information than you can absorb as a, as a user oftentimes.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.620]   And so, or you don't still go to very many of them.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.940]   And so the thing is, if you stretched all those, those talks out all summer and just put one
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:42.220]   out at a time and had a real, actual interactive conversation rather than a presentation, the
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.900]   developers would get a lot more out of it.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:50.660]   And if they had this constant, you know, input of, you know, of being able to talk to someone,
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.820]   you know, I think that it would just be far more powerful than what their, what people
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   are getting right now.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   And, and because they can only take on, you want to have them always have a place to go
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.020]   to, to get that information.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.540]   But it's actually more, I know this was not crazy, but it's more efficient to have more
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.540]   people.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.300]   The teachers, the student teacher ratio is actually, you know, it's important to have
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.500]   a big number, not a small number.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.780]   You created a test tube, a laboratory for this and proven it.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:19.420]   I hope somebody's listening at some of these big tech companies, especially Apple, because
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.860]   we're all, I love this.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.780]   I feel like we're in the Marvel comic universe.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.140]   We are no longer constrained by time and space.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.700]   But it is, it's true.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.700]   I mean, we're like the top, every strange.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.780]   No, it's like when Superman left Krypton and his father was talking to him in the little
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.940]   spaceship telling him that boundless galaxies of knowledge are now.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.540]   The big thing is though, is that everyone keeps on trying to figure out how to reproduce
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.540]   their conference.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.820]   Okay, how would we do it over four days or how do we do it over four days?
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.460]   I'm like, why are you doing that?
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.500]   That was, you know, that was, that made sense when we had to do it that way.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   But right now we don't have to do it that way.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.340]   We can stretch it all out.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:57.820]   Solve or at least help solve the one complaint people have about not having meet space conferences
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:03.700]   is that collegial sense of running in if people once a year that you have a serendipity.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.300]   This would solve that, I think, to some degree.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.660]   Well, and the thing is, is that inside of like, so there's, you know, there's 1500 people
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.980]   that are now signed up for this little office hours thing.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.900]   There's 300 that show up every day.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.420]   There's 300 that show up every day.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.100]   So every morning we've got 300 people, you know, they're talking.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.300]   They're not all telling their ones.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   Oh, they are.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:26.180]   No, no, no, there's, no, there's, there's about 40 that you have to get.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.540]   You have to get, well, they're not presenters.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.140]   They're, they're just the ones that they're what we call the OG, you know, the original
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.420]   case, they've a lot of them been around for a while, but they're, they're the panelists
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.620]   and they, they self organize that.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.180]   I mean, there's mic checks and stuff.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.380]   So if you don't have a good internet connection and good video and audio, most people just
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.620]   don't turn their video on because it's, you know, you have to have something to say anyway.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.780]   But the point is, is that then you have another 200 people that are watching, you know, two
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.500]   to two, two, two people that are just watching, but asking questions and they're in chat.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.740]   And then there's 400 people in a discord that are all talking all day, you know, about
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.540]   the stuff and we have people in the group that are now forming companies together.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.900]   They're doing collaborations with people they've never met.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   And it's way deep.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.940]   If you don't ask any of them that are going regularly, it's way deeper than any of the
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.740]   quote unquote hallway conversations or the drinks that we have at conferences because
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.100]   we're seeing each other all the time.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.340]   You know, now does that work in post COVID?
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   I don't know.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.540]   But when are we going to get to post COVID?
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   I don't know.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.620]   I think it might well work.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.620]   And I think that now on the grid on the, the, the grid that you you're using,
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.860]   zoom, it's there's 25 people on the grid at any given.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.420]   Well, that shows 25.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.020]   It's actually it's maxed out at 49.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.300]   I think the most we've ever had is about 44 45.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.140]   So when I, what most of us see is, is what I see is 49, we're going to probably cut
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.540]   it back to 25 because 49 is too many.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.780]   I can't see who's talking, you know, but, but the, but yeah, it's the, what stream out.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.500]   Do you have to moderate it?
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.020]   Do you have to, does somebody run it?
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.020]   It's heavily.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.020]   Oh, I run it.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.340]   So it's, it's definitely a moderated conversation.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:05.020]   You know, and the, what, what I think of it as is, is it's a moderated peer to peer learning
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.020]   system.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.180]   You know, so it's, it's, it's heavily curated.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.620]   You know, we're, you know, cause we, you know, uh, there's a set of rules of, of, of
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.740]   engagement of how people interact and how they, how they raise their hand and how they
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.780]   ask questions and you know, it's, it's very structured because without structure, you
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   can't scale.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.860]   You know, and so there's a lot of structure to it.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.260]   I think a lot of people think that they're just going to have a conversation and it's
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.820]   going to get bigger, but it has to have a lot of structure.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.100]   You know, and so, so, and there's, and in that structure is around, you know, mostly around
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.460]   respect, having a useful conversation, having it be pleasurable to listen to, have it be
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.460]   informative.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.220]   You know, those are all things that, you know, it's a clean show.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.900]   You know, it's, you know, there's a lot of, you know, those types of things.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.900]   And so we work on that.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:48.300]   And then you just keep on engaging with the folks that, you know, uh, are, keep showing
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.100]   up and provide useful information.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.620]   And it's a, it's a wide range of really high end pros in different areas from filmmaking
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:59.180]   to live to, to, you know, the folks that are selling the gear, the folks that are using
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.180]   the gear, the, you know, everything is kind of there.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.180]   And as it gets bigger, it gets smarter.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.260]   I don't mean to keep talking about it on here, but, but I think that when we think about
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:13.020]   dub dub and all these conferences, I think that it is, uh, what we're experimenting
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.900]   with keeps on, I keep on feeling like there's something here.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:21.180]   I don't know exactly this thing, but there's something here that is, um, most people who
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.820]   are going to regularly are saying this is the most, you know, they've learned more about
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.820]   media production.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.460]   They've learned in years, you know, you know, and, and because, but it's not, there's no
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.460]   classes.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.580]   There's no, we do have second hours where we talked about something specific.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:38.940]   So this today we were talking about how to do remote music production between Pro Tools
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:44.500]   and logic and, you know, people were actually sending music back and forth in multiple states.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.780]   And so that was the, there was an hour of that tomorrow.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.540]   It's about camera, uh, look up tables.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.620]   The next day is about how to, how production was done in the, how media production was
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:58.940]   done in the White House, uh, in the Obama, um, uh, administration and then on Friday,
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.300]   it's about concert photography.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.700]   So it changes every, you know, there's these one hours, but they're not classes.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   They're discussions.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.300]   You know, there, there's one person that really knows that are two or three people that really
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.380]   know that subject matter.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.540]   And then everyone starts, we call it the pit.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.620]   Um, you know, and everyone starts to ask them questions.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:18.620]   I think there's a lot of applications for this besides conferences.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.900]   This might be the future of education, frankly.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.740]   Uh, well, you know, it's, it's an interesting experiment, you know, but I think that when
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.540]   we think about conferences, I think that we need to think about ways to stretch those
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:33.740]   conversations out to get back to our current discussion is that how do we stretch these
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:40.100]   conversations out into a longer, um, you know, uh, not in a three day course, but a three
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.260]   month course or six months or just year round.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:45.500]   I mean, what if we stopped thinking about going to a conference and just started paying
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.620]   for a subscription that $1,500 that we give to Apple for the conference, just pay that
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:54.700]   every, you know, pay that for a yearly subscription to the educational platform that they now
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.220]   you get something every day that's available to you from, from Apple as part of that program.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.220]   Um, and, and I think that it would be far more effective.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.940]   It would build a closer relationship between Apple.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.500]   The hard part for Apple is just getting over the idea of putting engineers on video.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.380]   Constantly, like that's, I think you need somebody like you who has some media skills
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:18.620]   to be the presenter who could have speaker training, like all the people who are up on
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.260]   stage, they go through what's called speaker trading.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.100]   It is a huge difference in the people who've gone through all of that in the media training.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.100]   Well, and it's, and it's hard though.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.820]   I think that, um, I think about that a lot when we, when we see other people doing it
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:37.500]   when I'm, because I run a lot of other people shows and I realize that when you have the
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:42.540]   four of us have done a lot of this stuff and I look at whether, you know, the hosting process,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:48.100]   you know, what, what you do Leo, what I do to a lower, a lesser degree, uh, is there is
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.180]   so much going on for the host of throwing the con, you know, keeping the conversation
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.300]   moving, keeping it exciting, cutting people off when they're saying too much, not, you
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.500]   know, pulling things out of them when they're not saying enough, you know, um, you know,
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.500]   finding the right time to ask a question, you know, all these things are super complex
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.300]   and it takes a couple of thousand tries.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.660]   Or take a, yeah.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.900]   But notice I don't do it with 45 people.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.900]   It's really enjoyable.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   You should come join us sometime.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.900]   You do.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.900]   You do it in smaller batches, Leo.
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   You do in smaller batches.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.900]   You get 45 by the end of the week.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.060]   I would, I'd be very interested.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:24.020]   I think that this, uh, you know, someday, maybe when I retire, we could start doing something
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.020]   like this.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.260]   I, if you don't mind, if I steal your idea, I love this.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.820]   This is not at all such a clever idea.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:37.220]   If you go to, uh, YouTube.com/AlexLindsay as a Y, uh, and click any one of these.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.980]   This is today's, by the way, this is a nice feature you've added.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.860]   You've got notes now so you can jump to.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:43.860]   Do you know what I found out?
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.580]   If you put zero colon zero zero at the top, YouTube will automatically add chapter markers
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.820]   to the video for you.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.140]   Did you get a mock test chapter markers?
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.740]   I didn't know that.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.260]   It's a, it was a beta feature for the last month and it went wide this month.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.620]   Say it again so I understand it.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:06.180]   If you, if you, if you, yeah, if you put zero colon zero zero as the first time index, then
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.460]   for people who have the feature enabled, it'll actually create a jump list at the bottom
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:13.820]   of the video on the webpage and in the mobile app and you can just tap to go to whatever
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.340]   section you want.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.500]   So I, as the person watching it do that?
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.340]   No, the Alex would put it in the description.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.340]   As a streamer.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.340]   But then it didn't, yeah.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.340]   And then it enables that interface element for you.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.980]   What you're telling is the jump list.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.620]   Yeah, we've got zero zero now add more, uh, yeah.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.820]   And how does it know when to, when to market?
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.180]   When it sees that in the time, sees the list starting with zero zero.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   I mean, this is, this is a, you know, Jeffrey Powers, who's, who does a lot of YouTube work
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.380]   and he saw it.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.500]   He couldn't stand the fact that I was just streaming it.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.180]   So he was like, let me take that over.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.180]   Yes.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.180]   He does.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.180]   He does.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.180]   He put all these doing it manually.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   He does.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   I think he does it during the show.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.980]   So that, that thing is, he does it while he's listening.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:57.980]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.980]   Nothing pops up right out.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.340]   Somebody has to push a button or you just enter in the comments.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.980]   You know, it's still manual.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:06.620]   Like you have to tell it, yeah, you have to tell it where the, where the jumps you want
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.060]   are and then it will, but it'll create the interface for you once you make the proper
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.060]   list.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.980]   Here's the, the YouTube help article, which I think the chat room for finding video chapters
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.060]   to help you more easily navigate videos.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.060]   And, and that tells you exactly how to turn that on.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.340]   So somebody is writing this, still has to write this stuff down.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.580]   I've been using it for reviews because some people care more about one.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.460]   So especially when the videos get longer, some people care about more about one section
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.460]   than another.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.260]   And Alex, you always have to have a secretary for any meeting.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.580]   And I'm, I'm glad you now have a designated secretary to take notes.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.180]   He's a lot more than a secretary, but he's, he's good at coaching me on, on, because
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.780]   I'm like, ah, YouTube, I'll put it up there.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.420]   I will see how it goes.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:54.740]   And, but it's a good, it's a good, it's a good place to see if you like what you're
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.100]   seeing, whether that would even be remotely.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.900]   But I would say the YouTube experience is there's something about being in it where everyone's
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:05.260]   talking in the chat and there's questions and it's just like it's, you know, I put it
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.620]   up on YouTube and people tell me that they listen to it and they like listening to it
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.620]   there.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:14.260]   But I always feel like it's like 10% of the experience, you know, of what, of what it's
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.580]   like to be in the room.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.700]   So it's, it's, it's an amazing experience.
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.700]   Sunday I'll get up.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.940]   Let's get the hang out with the coolest bunch of people every morning.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.740]   I am and I will look at to see it.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.380]   The group assembles starts at some of the six AM, the presentations begin at seven and
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.700]   then there's the third hour.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.700]   Well, basically do Q and A.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.620]   And that's all for specific time.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.300]   Seven to eight is Q and A.
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.860]   So it's just any questions that come up we just answered and then eight to nine is some,
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:38.860]   some kind of thing.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.060]   And again, I think that pertinent to this conversation is just that I think that there's
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:46.100]   something about it that I hope folks are taking, you know, folks that are thinking about conferences
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:50.060]   look at as a possibility of constant conversation.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.060]   Yes.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.060]   Oh, I'd love it.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:56.140]   If Apple just started doing this, they've got the resources to do it.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.340]   And they have the mechanisms now with things like the today at Apple at home, you know,
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:04.380]   starting to learn how to have people produce and post video on apple.com.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.580]   I've always thought this whole COVID thing would, there would be benefits as well as
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.060]   detriments to it.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.420]   And obviously we know about the detriments and the companies going out of business and
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.260]   the 25% unemployment in the United States and all that.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.140]   But we're also learning some new skills and thank goodness we had the technologies to
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.780]   take advantage of those.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:23.780]   So.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.580]   Well, and I think that there's such a huge opportunity.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.660]   The reason I'm pushing so hard is that there's such a huge opportunity for us to include the
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:29.820]   rest of the world.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.580]   When these physical events cut out so many people, they cut out the opportunity for people
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.380]   to be part of these conversations.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:39.020]   So my interest in it, you know, is how do we create this global conversation?
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:44.380]   You know, and how do we, you know, and I will admit that I really want to sever, sever
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:51.100]   the head of physical events because I think that they undermine the ability for, I do
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.220]   a lot of work in Africa and I see a lot of people who can never come to these because
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.660]   of immigration, because of visas, because of everything else.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.620]   And I know that if these go online, it means that they get an opportunity to have those
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.180]   and people who don't have the same amount of money, people don't have, you know, have
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:07.780]   the same ability to get to these conferences.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.220]   You know, and so they get this horrible little live stream or a little set of videos that
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.940]   are really boring to watch because they weren't able to come.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.820]   And if we can kill this off, it creates an enormous, and we figure out how to do it well
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.220]   online instead.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.580]   We create a huge opportunity for a lot of other people to be part of the conversation.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.580]   And that's my interest in it.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.060]   You know, my interest is to make it more available to more people.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:33.700]   And the way to do that is to get rid of these physical events.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:41.780]   So in 13.5, Apple released the API, Google's done the same on Android, for the exposure
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.020]   notification.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:49.220]   And Zach Hall on 9 to 5, Mac has been keeping track of which states plan to use it.
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.220]   Very few.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.180]   I think it's four.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:53.180]   Fifty.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.180]   And Italy.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:59.060]   And yeah, France said no, Germany said, OK, Latvia says it's going to do it.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.180]   And the first one is launched.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.660]   This is Italy's.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.340]   Immuni or immuni.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.060]   No, it's in English.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.420]   So I don't maybe it could be an immunity.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420]   Immuni.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.460]   Hey, are you immunity?
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.540]   No.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.300]   So protect yourself, help slow down the epidemic.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.660]   You turn it on.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:22.180]   It has other information in it and it emphasizes your privacy is safe.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.780]   Immuni does not collect your name.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.660]   The birth address telephone number, email address, or spaghetti sauce preference.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.660]   It cannot.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.660]   That was really rude.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.660]   But I'm an Italian American, so it's OK.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.620]   No, it's not OK.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620]   So that's interesting.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.380]   I want, you know, one of the.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.580]   And we talked about this pretty extensively on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.900]   Bruce Schneider, Brookings Institute, a lot of people are starting to come forward saying,
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:54.180]   no app will ever be particularly useful, especially when the respect respects privacy.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.620]   They're useful in preventing other people from stealing our information using the cover
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.620]   of COVID-19.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.620]   Yes.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:03.420]   If all they want to say is COVID-19 gives us an excuse to steal your information, Google
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.700]   and Apple providing a service by by by saying, OK, this is all you get.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.860]   But health officials say that's not enough to do real contact tracing.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.580]   We still have to hire tens of thousands of humans.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.340]   And we do have to invade your privacy because that's what contact tracing is.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.100]   And actually, Apple's app could be useful if they didn't mind giving up location information,
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.780]   but Apple's very clear that that's not going to happen.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.780]   So I don't know.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.780]   We'll see.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.900]   Maybe immune will be a great boon in Italy.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.060]   Just don't know.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.820]   Switzerland's doing a non-public trial date.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.300]   The issue with the Swiss app Beatmaster is a Swiss citizen in our chat room.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.820]   He tells me is that they have never they don't have any privacy framework or any framework
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.020]   at all for the use of any of this stuff.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:57.420]   So they have to Swiss federal government has to approve or make some rules has to do some
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   rules, but they're testing it.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.620]   Meanwhile, there's a bipartisan piece of legislation that's making its way through Congress right
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:12.820]   now to not to censure Google and Apple, but simply to say any basically to lay down rules
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:18.900]   of privacy for any COVID-19 tracking or health tracking app, which would be a hell of a thing
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:24.060]   because would be the first time that any law really made any promises or many of the warranties
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.260]   about privacy on a federal level.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.820]   Yeah, they're breaking encryption at the same time.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.620]   So it's always why it's always that.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:37.100]   Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously governments will invade your privacy the minute they can.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:41.020]   They obviously would love to have, especially now with protests going on contact tracing
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:45.740]   and things like that for protesters as opposed to COVID.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:52.980]   But it is also the case that an app that doesn't help human contact tracers do their
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.620]   job isn't going to be particularly useful.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.340]   Isn't the old joke that they want the government just small enough to fit inside your bedroom?
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.340]   It's not a joke.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.300]   That's no joke.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:10.500]   Yeah, the real argument seems to be about not not just having humans involved in the
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.780]   tracking and tracing process, but basically getting as much data as possible to analyze
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.140]   and to build new models from.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:23.700]   And unfortunately, the most useful apps will provide the most, the greatest amount of information
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.380]   about where people went, how much time they spent in a location, what kind of a location
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:32.060]   was it, what kind of people were they hanging with, all this other sort of stuff.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.660]   And unfortunately, that's the sort of fine grain data that is absolutely a no go for
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.660]   privacy.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.660]   There's also.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.660]   They hadn't violated our privacy.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:44.380]   Maybe it'd be more trusting of them, but it comes on the heels of demonstrable violations
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.380]   of privacy over the last few years.
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.380]   Exactly.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.260]   I don't see when I saw it coming out, I was like, no, I was going to put this on their
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.260]   phone.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:56.860]   No, even if it's private and even if and it's not useful because it doesn't give health.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.420]   I mean, if you're a contract tracer, what you'd love is if I could give you my phone
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.740]   and you could see all the places I've been and all the people I've run into.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.580]   So they'll just make Pokemon trace Leo.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580]   That'll solve that problem.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:10.300]   They'll download it and we'll be playing Pikachu while giving up all our data.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   It's one of the reasons.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.700]   Honestly, I feel like we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place in the US
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.660]   because we're individualists.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:23.260]   The countries that have conquered this are much more collectivist societies and people
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:29.060]   are willing to do stuff because it's for the good of all.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.380]   Here in the United States, we're basically cowboys.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.740]   We're out there and saying, nope, I'm done on my watch.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.820]   So I guess COVID's here to stay.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:45.580]   I shouldn't be so pessimistic about it.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:50.820]   What about this issue with iOS?
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.740]   Male having a critical security flaw.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:05:01.660]   It says iOS and iPadOS users should install Apple's latest security updates immediately.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:07.980]   Germany's federal cybersecurity agency has issued a warning.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:14.300]   The vulnerabilities were actually discovered first in the US by Zekops, which is a security
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.780]   firm.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.780]   And it's a zero day.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780]   They were being actively exploited.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.860]   In fact, they have been since January of 2018.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:27.020]   Apple says we found no evidence they're used against customers.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.620]   It's this weird thing in computers.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:36.220]   I mean, over the same week we saw an iMessage or text string that would destroy your iPhone.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.140]   There was an image that people tried to trick you into putting on your Samsung phone that
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.900]   would destroy your Samsung phone.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:45.500]   And parsing is the enemy of security.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.860]   Whether it's Unicode parsing or emoji parsing or image parsing or anything that requires
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.540]   data to be fed through a parser.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.300]   It seems like some bad actor can malform that data in a way that causes nothing but the
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   question.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.500]   The interpreters are the biggest flaw.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.780]   Even fonts can be used maliciously.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:10.180]   So Zekops says they believe with high confidence that the flaws have been exploited in the
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.660]   wild, there's zero-click flaws, which are as bad as you can get.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.460]   You don't have to actually, as a user, do anything to be hacked.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.020]   But that's one reason--
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.700]   It's the same thing that happened a month ago, right?
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.700]   There was like, this is a mail flow.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.700]   I was like, nobody's using it.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.700]   They're like, yes, people are using it.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.260]   It's not the same story.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.900]   One more reason to do 13 point--
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.900]   What is it?
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   13.15.1?
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   I can't even number it.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   13.5.5, I think.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.900]   So many numbers.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:36.900]   So many numbers.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:46.660]   I hope you got your MacBook Pro because Apple just doubled the price of RAM on the
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.660]   entry of the phone.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.660]   So that's actually not the case.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.660]   Oh, it's not.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.660]   I found out about this.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.900]   So when it initially-- if you look across the website, across the pricing, it's always
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.060]   a $200 increase for RAM.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.420]   When it first came out, it was discounted.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   Some people are saying accidentally.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.420]   It was $100.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.420]   I find it hard.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.580]   Yeah, I find it hard to believe that it's possible that with COVID and all this stuff
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.140]   going on, someone who had to race to the office to do something did something wrong.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.500]   I have a hard time believing that.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:16.860]   But in either way, it was incorrectly or it was purposefully discounted at first, and
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.980]   it has now gone back to the normal price, the same price that you would pay for the exact
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.340]   same upgrade on the MacBook Air.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.420]   So if you bought early, you got a deal.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.860]   That's what the Verge says is that Apple told them, "It's a price correction.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.580]   It's not an increase."
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   We always--
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.140]   No, I heard the same thing earlier.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.140]   Wow.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.140]   Now I'm kicking myself.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.140]   I was thinking about it and then I thought, "Well, I like my MacBook Air.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.100]   I don't need it."
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.860]   But I ain't using no 8 gig RAM machine of any kind.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.740]   And some people wonder, like, they always like, "Why is the RAM so expensive?"
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.580]   And the thing is, it's just an easily digestible marketing ploy.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.700]   If you go to almost any store, there's the bad microwave, the decent microwave, and the
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.580]   premium microwave.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.980]   And some companies have the crappy built laptop and the decently built laptop and the super
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.460]   awesome built laptop.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.660]   And Apple has always found it to be understandable to humans, and we're willing to put up with
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:15.700]   it that they'll make all the MacBooks built with the same quality, but you'll pay like
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.540]   200 bucks for every RAM and it's just the lunacy of marketing.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.860]   We used to have an issue where, I mean, with many, many products, the feature set and the
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.980]   quality of the feature set are two very different things.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.940]   And so just because they say they're all the same doesn't mean that they are actually
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:32.940]   the same.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.660]   And when they're a huge price difference, it doesn't mean that it's just someone's overcharging
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.660]   you.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.660]   It might mean that it did something else.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:46.900]   And one of the things that we learned in the '90s was that our Macs would be much more
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:51.020]   if we went through a lot of trouble to check the RAM, electric image back then made a
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   RAM checker that you'd leave on all weekend.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.020]   And it would literally go through every register one at a time and just keep on working through
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.020]   it.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.820]   And if it saw anything, we'd replace it with another piece of RAM.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.900]   And we found that it was the number one predictor of how stable our system was going to be was
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:10.980]   how good our RAM was and how, you know, and we, and one of them, I mean, it was we could
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.060]   do things that you just didn't think were possible with the computer.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:20.380]   Like we had 7 million objects in or I think it was 750,000, 70,000 objects in avid, but
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.340]   that comes from everything being tuned, including all that RAM.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:26.700]   And I think I don't know how much RAM got sent back to make that work, but it was a
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.700]   lot.
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.420]   We went through a lot of RAM that was completely considered completely acceptable RAM, high
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:34.460]   quality RAM that if you really went through it, there were some registries that weren't
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.380]   that weren't totally flat.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.060]   And so the RAM is a huge deal.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:45.620]   And so buying cheaper RAM is not going to necessarily get you a more stable machine.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.260]   It's definitely worth paying for.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.380]   It's the thing that is going to keep your machine running, you know, getting rid of spinning
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.780]   drives and having high quality drive and high quality RAM.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.460]   That's what it's constantly going in and out of your computer as it works.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.580]   And if it's not at the highest quality, you may have unpredictable results.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.340]   Well, and of course, Apple RAM is not upgradable.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.340]   You get what you get.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.340]   That's it.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.340]   So on the laptops.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:13.500]   If you're, if you're getting it, get as much as you're going to need.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.900]   No one ever feels like darn it.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.820]   I got too much RAM.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.580]   I have a 64 gig RAM iMac Pro.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:24.340]   I probably didn't need to buy all that.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   You'll find it just not working.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.340]   You just not playing.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.340]   That's all it's going to.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.340]   You have.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:32.380]   You can keep the entire season of the West Wing in, in RAM disk.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.940]   I actually forgot that I think you talked me into it, Renee, because I got the 10 core
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940]   iMac Pro.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.740]   And I forgot that I opted for all of that RAM.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.340]   The other day I was looking at the specs and I went, what?
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.540]   Well, I mean, if Alex sent you some more computational photography images, you could
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.540]   make you think that.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540]   Oh, man.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   I'm a fan of the screen.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.260]   Hey, Leo, if you don't feel like it's working hard now, if you just get me a log in and
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.740]   I'll just start sending some in your computer.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.740]   You'll just look over and your computer is like white hot, you know, like it's like
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.740]   glowing.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.340]   It's like steady at home, but with Alex smiling at you.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:10.580]   I have that the menu as I stat menu bar, which shows all the cores working and, you know,
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.580]   basically they're going, you got anything, you got anything else?
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.580]   Is that all you got?
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.580]   Did you see the file?
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.580]   I can say the files I sent to Justine.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:17.580]   You know what you got?
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.580]   You showed me.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:19.580]   You got it.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.580]   I know.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.580]   We looked that thing up.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.100]   I don't really have a lot of photogrammetry applications in my life yet.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.620]   That's just because you don't know how to do it well enough.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.140]   No, you would love it if you.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.260]   I think honestly, if I had got 32 gigs, I wouldn't have noticed a difference.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.340]   In fact, probably wouldn't have noticed a difference over the got 16 gigs.
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.700]   I'm thinking, well, that's until this until this channel goes to a KLAO and then you'll
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.860]   be you'll be wishing from.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.420]   I a little bit overbought on that.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.660]   Let's put it this way.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:56.420]   If I don't if I'm sitting here using my Macbook air and I then go to my iMac Pro and I don't
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.620]   notice the difference at all.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.940]   I think I overbought.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.780]   I think yeah, Apple got really good at Apple got really good back when they were stuck
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:09.660]   on the low power DDR3 ram of doing everything they could like memory compression and STD
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:14.460]   really fast SSD swap to make those to make all that ram feel as big as they possibly
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.780]   good and the sound of the side effect of that now is that people like, I don't really need
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.380]   Ram turns out.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.420]   So what color you're going to get?
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.580]   You're going to get lava pink.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.580]   You go.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.580]   Baby.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.220]   The power beats pro.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.220]   This is this is the big hardware upgrade.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.820]   The power ranger colors.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.340]   The power ranger colors.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   Wow.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:43.100]   You get your spring yellow, your raspberry red, your no, no, that's I'm sorry.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.100]   That's fruit loops.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.140]   Your spring yellow, your cloud pink.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.140]   Clovers.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.980]   That's the way.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:51.980]   Blue diamonds.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   Blue.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   That's lucky charms.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.980]   That's lucky charms.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.340]   Lava red and glacier blue.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   They're pretty.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.700]   It's just and they're in addition to the other colors.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:07.740]   They're not instead of so you can still get the black and the white and do you.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.340]   What do you do you use your power beats pros?
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.180]   I use them only because my ears are so mangled from years of grappling.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.180]   Like I'm wearing an air.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.980]   I'm sorry, an AirPods pro in this year and it will stay in mostly, but the regular ones
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   don't.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.340]   My left ear is better than my right ear, but the power beats pro go around my ear.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:31.300]   So if I'm doing anything active at all, I need that full ear cupage to.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.260]   I should get some of these for Lisa.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.980]   I gave her my AirPods pro.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:43.820]   I think and then I've had a bunch of other like a Jabra and I think I fried everything
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.500]   that had a USB micro USB.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.740]   I must have a bad cable or adapter somewhere.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.380]   Because all of a sudden, yeah, because that must be possible.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.380]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.420]   Yeah, I think I fried a bunch of stuff all of a sudden nothing will charge.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.820]   So now have to figure out where it was.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.900]   I'm plugging it in.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.180]   So maybe it's time to get some the advantage of.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.060]   People will buy like a thousand dollar headphones, plug them into dollar store cables and wonder
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.060]   what happened to you.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.060]   You got to be careful.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:13.820]   The type C in lightning is, you know, they're not using my USB.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]   That's the event.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.740]   So now, but remember there was that Google engineer who had to rate every single one of
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.660]   them on Amazon until they got their act together and started making safe USB C cables.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.660]   That's right.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.860]   So maybe I should get these are the expensive though, these power B pros, right?
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.460]   Yeah, 249 US.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.820]   OK, same as AirPod pros.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.660]   They don't have the noise canceling or no?
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:36.740]   No, it's they have isolation, not canceling.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.180]   So there's no active process on them.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.460]   They just stick in your ears.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.380]   Yeah, just just a quick comment.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:48.140]   Cables are I've decided the cables are like socks that at some point you should just throw
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.860]   out all of the ones that all of your regular socks and just replace them with new wonderful
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   ones.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.340]   It's it's it's it's not that expensive to simply say I'm how many USB C how many lightning
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.340]   cables do I actually use and then say, OK, I'm going to throw every single one of them
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.100]   or at least I'm going to put them in a Ziploc bag and put them someplace that's kind of
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.060]   hard to find in case I really, really am desperate for a cable and I'm going to replace them
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:14.900]   all with really, really good cables and just solve that problem immediately and permanently.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:21.140]   We're seeing just so many problems where things are just not it's not that they're not completely
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.140]   working.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.180]   I mean, not you know, it's not like they just plug them in and it doesn't show up.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.500]   It's that we're seeing all kinds of instabilities like just odd instabilities related to cables
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500]   that that it's just a very wide range.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.180]   It's I'm following Andy's advice and I've been slowly getting rid of ones that I don't
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:39.180]   know where they came from or that they're not beefy enough and everything else because
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:43.260]   it's just there's something about USB C that is far more sensitive.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.660]   It's probably a lot more data.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:49.380]   So it's just it's USB C and Thunderbolt seem to be a lot more sensitive now than they
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.380]   were before.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.700]   And then make sure that they're clearly marked which one they are because they're not the
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.700]   same.
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.700]   Yeah, not that I'm bitter.
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   Absolutely.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:57.700]   Let's make this thing.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.260]   It's fun to make all the cables different.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.740]   It really it really is like going through a memory lane to like you can act it's almost
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.900]   like going through a scrapbook saying, Oh, that's the one I bought at the CVS pharmacy
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.980]   in central square in Cambridge because I forgot the charger and there was a Starbucks nearby.
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.460]   Oh, that's the one I bought in Chicago because I bought I thought I'd brought a lightning
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:23.540]   cable, but actually I brought a USB C cable and so I couldn't charge my old iPad.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.620]   And yeah, so so they're good for nostalgia, but that's about it.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:32.380]   I had a friend who bought an iPad Pro a couple weeks ago and he tried to plug it into an
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.500]   LG display and it didn't work.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.660]   And he texted me and I go, Oh, yeah, because the LG display once Thunderbolt not USB C.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.060]   He's like, but it plugs in the same cable.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:42.980]   It really is.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:48.180]   So, so, and then there's the ones with PD with PD power delivery and not with power.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.380]   I mean, yeah, the whole thing is trying to be civilized and human.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.980]   They became totally unselfling and human.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.580]   It's remarkable.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:02.780]   Gal Gadot, this, you know, I think the world, one of the things we've always needed in this
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.860]   world is a Henny Lamar biopic and it will.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.860]   Starring Wonder Woman.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.860]   Starring Wonder Woman.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:16.500]   Man, that's a that Apple has ordered Henny Lamar starring an executive produced by gal.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.100]   Do you think this is intentional?
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.900]   Like they've got Captain America.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.900]   They've got the Hulk.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:27.220]   They've got like every single Marvel and DC hero on Apple TV that can't be a Marvel
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.380]   content, but they have all the stars.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.500]   Yeah, that is interesting.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.860]   No word in the Apple press release on how much they paid for this, but Apple has been
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.660]   writing some hefty checks.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:43.220]   Well, they took, I guess they they, Martin Scorsese couldn't sell his next film and then
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.500]   Apple's like, yeah, we'll give you a hundred and eighty million dollars.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.900]   And eighty million for killers of the Flower Moon.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:55.180]   Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Helming as they say in Hollywood.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.260]   It's Bafo.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:01.820]   And here's why this should really worry theater owners and theater distribution and that whole
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:07.340]   process is that fundamentally it just didn't add up to do to a theater, but it did add up
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.180]   for online distribution.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.340]   And that should, you know, it's a bigger game now.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.260]   Like the big films are going to, I think over the next two to three years, you're going
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.740]   to see the biggest films with the biggest budgets are going to start moving towards a
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.900]   company like Apple or Disney or someone else paying for it for their online because they're
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:27.020]   competing with everybody else and the money doesn't, the ticket sales don't matter to
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.020]   them.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.460]   They're trying to, you know, pull in subscribers over long periods of time.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.500]   And so the math is just a very different math that's going to allow filmmakers to have
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.100]   more freedom and more budget, you know, to do that, to do those things.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.580]   And I think this is just the beginning of that.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.580]   The Irishman was the same thing.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.740]   Yeah, he got a huge budget for the Irishman.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.740]   And spent even more.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:48.740]   Right.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:54.820]   I didn't know though, Scorsese has a long relationship with Apple.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:19:00.740]   He was in an iPhone ad, but he also, he also apparently directed a scene in his movie
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.660]   The Departed using iChat.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:10.580]   Not only that, but he actually, there's actually footage in the Wolf of Wall Street that was
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.140]   shot on an iPhone.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.140]   What really?
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:19.860]   Yeah, because the, what's special, they needed a, one of the shots on the special effects
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.860]   shot list was we need a shot of like on an airplane above the seat, give it the fast
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.340]   and seat belt sign on.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:29.660]   And so the special effects guy was just on a plane and just held up his iPhone and then
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.620]   like you're just recorded what was there and then like at a meeting.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.820]   So okay, well, here's the sort of thing that we're going to be going for because I shot
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.420]   when we actually do the real thing.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.500]   And then Scorsese said, well, why don't we just use the real iPhone shot?
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.500]   Good.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.500]   Okay.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.820]   Apparently that's happened in quite a few really famous movies where they've taken like the
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.380]   sample shot on the iPhone and it's ended up in some really, really famous movie.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.940]   Okay, we're going to office hours now with Alex Lindsey.
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.940]   So what would the challenges be?
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:20:01.260]   I mean, it's high quality is 4K color matching would be tricky, but there's something to
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.260]   feel.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:07.940]   Yeah, I mean, you're talking about the using iPhone footage in a motion, major motion picture.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:11.820]   Oh, that's the mixing and matching content is happens all the time.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.140]   I mean, low light is harder, you know, is harder.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.100]   I mean, it's going to fall apart faster.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.220]   And they're a pain placard is a very simple thing.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.740]   You don't have to have to have a depth of field or light or anything, right?
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:27.300]   Yeah, I think that for small shots like that, we've seen lots of iPhones being used for different
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.820]   things like that, whereas an insert shot or something quick, because that shot, I don't
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.820]   know.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:36.460]   I don't remember how long it was, but it I bet you it was measured in frames.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.060]   People use stock footage in movies all the time.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:44.100]   I'm watching the credits and I'm seeing, you know, thanks to Shutterstock, I stock photo
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.660]   and I mean, right, we even shoot that forever.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.620]   Well, there's there's things that you can do like establishing shots.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:56.460]   I mean, I've done once where we took an image off of I stock, we then projected it did what
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:01.020]   we call camera, camera projection mapping just projected over a simple objects, and then
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:06.300]   just do a little camera push, you know, and a little cars and then for a second, it's
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.500]   like, and it's like, this is this location.
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   And it's, you know, I think it's real.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500]   It's 40,000.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:15.220]   It's $40,000 cheaper than it was it was going to be otherwise.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.860]   And so, so especially at the last minute in a show and you and where that really is popular,
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.700]   it's less than big feature films and more and smaller feature films and television shows.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:28.300]   The old, you know, the back in television shows, we only had a couple million dollars
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:33.460]   an episode, you know, so the, but being able to say the director saying what we really
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.020]   need right here is an establishing shot or we really need this little, whatever, and
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:42.620]   being able to throw a real quick piece in that's using stock photography or, or something
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.620]   from a cell phone.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:49.180]   I mean, again, the, it's really hard to compete with the iPhone because there's just so many
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:52.700]   engineers, there's so much money because then one of the number one reasons people upgrade
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   is for the phone.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:58.720]   And so as a result, Samsung and Apple primarily, I mean, those are the two big ones, play so
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.100]   hard in the camera area that these cameras are getting to be amazing, you know, like
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.260]   they're just amazing, you know, pieces of machinery.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.300]   And so I think that we're just going to see more and more of that.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.940]   I mean, I think that the whole shooting the whole film on it.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.500]   I know Soderbergh has done that.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.500]   Yeah, it's a killer.
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.300]   Like, because the thing is, there's no list on it.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.700]   There's still depth of field becomes starts to become an issue.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:25.220]   Now the question will be is like, what I haven't tried to do is like, well, at some point,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.060]   the LiDAR and everything else is going to make the depth of field a lot more accurate.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:34.980]   So in a lot and instant, so you have the ability to possibly, you know, recreate a lot of
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.620]   that as well.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.660]   And so that's going to help kind of figure that out because imagine, again, what you're
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:46.060]   getting to with LiDAR and the photography on the iPad and hopefully someday on the iPhone
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.380]   is the ability that you're shooting a raw plate that you can add depth of field and you
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:54.460]   can add 3D elements and you can have all kinds of the composites can all be done, you know,
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.980]   later in post, you know, you have all that data there to do it well.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.380]   And so we're seeing a little bit of that with portrait, you know, photography, but with
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:05.900]   LiDAR and as that continues to grow, it could really get to a point where you could do a
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.940]   lot later.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.980]   And so you have a raw plate that's all in focus that you can keep on deciding what is
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.060]   and what isn't.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:17.140]   And so does that replace what we're doing for a Martin Scorsese film?
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.140]   Probably not.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:21.220]   A small shot here and there, that probably makes sense.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.620]   But for, you know, the stuff we're seeing on YouTube and even smaller budget stuff, I
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.620]   think it could be really interesting.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:31.220]   Well, what's interesting to me is they had on the screencast as a wonderful podcast.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:35.980]   It's John August and aforementioned Craig Mazen and they had on the person I'm blanking
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.180]   on his name, the person who was directing the Ryan Reynolds rock movie for Netflix and they
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.140]   had to stop production obviously.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:45.180]   And they were talking about what that does to budgets because when you come back, you
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:49.180]   only have a skeleton crew and that is so it's going to take an additional 10 days or
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:53.140]   an additional 20 days or an additional month and that has to be budgeted.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.020]   And a lot of the smaller movies, I mean, the rock will get the budget, but a lot of smaller
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:57.020]   places won't.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:01.940]   So the ability to save whatever money they can and becomes not just nice for them, but
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.500]   urgent for them.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.500]   Right.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:12.540]   What I thought was interesting is that famously Netflix got the Irishman Scorsese's last and
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:18.780]   they, so it doesn't look like Netflix worked very hard to try to get this movie.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:23.860]   So that might indicate that that might indicate that the Irishman was more of a, it gave
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.560]   them attention and prestige, but didn't translate into making their money back.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   So we'll see.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.780]   I mean, if that's got to be like the easiest check to write.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:39.220]   Like if you want, if you want to get prestige Scorsese or Spielberg, you're good.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.220]   Whatever you want.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.620]   You should, you should write that check if that is your goal.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:50.140]   Although, although given that, I just have to say that I was reading the Hollywood Reporter
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.940]   had a piece about it, I was saying that as Apple is not just like writing the check,
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.860]   like buying the movie, they are like being the, they're, they're designated themselves
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.860]   as the creative studio supporting the project.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:05.900]   And I'm like, Oh, those, those boys and girls are going to have such a fun time telling
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:11.140]   app, telling Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio that we're not, we have some notes
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.140]   on this scene.
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.940]   Like that's going to be, that's going to be fun.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.140]   I want to see the behind the scenes documentary on that.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.140]   I don't think they've done it though.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.700]   Another thing where they're saying they're not, they're deliberately not doing notes
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.660]   or letting all the studio people do that.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.060]   Although I do wonder if they're like, Oh, no, no, Deneero has to, Deneero can't use an
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.340]   iPhone or Leo can't use an iPhone.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:35.500]   Yeah, well, at least on earlier TV productions, weren't there some, some stories about lots
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:38.740]   of interference about, about sexual content and nudity?
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.860]   And we were apparently not true.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:44.860]   And based on shows like C and like, I got to.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.100]   Well, I am here, man.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.100]   I was excited.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:52.300]   Yeah, Jason Momoa, you don't get, you don't hire him unless you want all the nudity that
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.020]   you can possibly get on that screen.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.420]   And violence like that show like captivated people the first three seconds.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:04.060]   I have to admit that as a parent, I was excited that Apple, I thought Apple TV plus is going
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.380]   to be something that is PG 13 at most.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.380]   And I can watch it.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.580]   And then when the first came out, I was like, there's nothing here I can show my kids.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:13.180]   Like, that's Disney plus like you have all these people complaining that they can't like
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.060]   they got a show green lit for Disney plus and Disney's like, no, that's a little bit too
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.060]   mature.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.060]   You're going to Hulu now.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:23.060]   And so all these shows are having even like Lizzie McGuire is being forced onto Hulu
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.140]   because they won't let her get 30 year old Lizzie McGuire on Disney plus.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.380]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.380]   Right.
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.100]   Little public service management.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:36.500]   If you're going to loot an Apple store, you might think twice.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.580]   Apparently, none of that stuff is going to be usable.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.380]   Here's a screenshot.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.540]   Since please return to Apple walnut street.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.700]   This device has been disabled and is being tracked.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:52.900]   Local authorities will be alerted.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:56.740]   Apple's actually closing its stores and boarding them up because of looting.
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.740]   Maybe don't loot.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:58.740]   I'm going to throw that out there.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   Maybe just don't.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.740]   Maybe don't.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.940]   Doesn't reflect well on your cause.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.580]   It gives people bad people an excuse to do bad things.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.460]   Or if you're an influencer and you're getting someone taking a photo of you looking like
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.100]   you're looting, maybe you find a better life.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.100]   Did you see?
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.100]   It was everywhere.
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.100]   I saw a bunch of them.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.100]   Amazing.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.100]   Influencers.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.820]   That's something we could get rid of without a whole lot of complaint.
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:23.820]   Unbelievable.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.820]   There.
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:29.580]   There's a few of the pressures off.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:33.940]   We can have to get them seats on the Golden Fringe and B arc for sure.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.900]   Up there with the phone sterilizers.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:41.300]   And what were the other group that was in there?
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.300]   Panelists, telephone sanitizers.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.340]   That's been a while since I read that one.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.380]   So many of those groups and I still want it done.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:53.300]   Did you see the, this is after the Santa Monica looting.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:57.220]   Let me see if I can find this.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.660]   This was widely circulated.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.260]   This Santa Monica woman who pretended to real, she's helping.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:05.940]   I'm helping while her.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.180]   And there was another one for an assistant to do a belphi while she was staring at a
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.940]   broken T-Mobile store.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.580]   They often never say they drive off.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.380]   And then Jake Paul was just loitering around one of the establishments.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.380]   So they just stop.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.900]   Just happen to, just be loitering, loitering around.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.660]   Just, you know, oh my God.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.660]   Do something good.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.660]   Do something good.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.860]   Do you like Mr. Rogers?
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:29.860]   Just be nice.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:30.860]   Be nice.
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:31.860]   I understand people are angry.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.100]   They're, they're right to be angry.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.100]   But it's not your content.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.100]   Yes.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.100]   It should not be your content.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.020]   Not your content.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:50.260]   Um, Oliver Haslam says you can own a former Apple Mike Markolas as CEO mansion for a mere
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.780]   37 and a half million dollars.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:55.380]   Oliver would just use that to deep pry everything.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:00.180]   Can you get to keep the horse collar hanging on the wall there in the kitchen?
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.180]   That's weird.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:08.220]   That's, that's, that's, I've heard of staging a property for, for, for the listing, but I'm
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.820]   not sure what they're marketing towards there.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.500]   That's, I don't understand that business.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.020]   Um, it looks pretty.
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.780]   It's a pretty, pretty, pretty part of the, part of the world.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.780]   It's a 5,000 square, 5,400 square foot mansion.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:29.220]   But for some reason with 50, 50, 400 square feet, it only has one bedroom, three bathrooms.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.660]   So there's, I guess there's really one person.
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:32.940]   It's for one person.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.700]   It's one person.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.060]   That's it.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.220]   And that's one space.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.620]   I don't, I don't get that at all.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.540]   I mean, I'm not, it's not even his main house.
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.580]   He bought it for nine million.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:50.260]   Uh, I just, this is not worth 37 million.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260]   I don't care.
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.900]   I, I, the whole kitchen has to go.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:54.900]   It's just got to go.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.460]   Uh, let's take a break.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:00.260]   We're going to come back and your picks gentlemen and just a bit.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:04.300]   I already have something Lisa got me something, uh, very special.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.820]   I know she's so thoughtful.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:10.140]   It's, uh, it's my manscape kit.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.860]   Oh, it finally came.
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.780]   Lisa's giving me a little hint here.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:20.540]   You know, if you're quarantined with or without somebody, but if you're quarantined, it's
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.060]   not a bad idea to keep your grooming going, right?
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:30.860]   Um, but sometimes gentlemen, you're doing some extra grooming and it can get risky.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:37.380]   You ever experienced, uh, uh, unfortunate occurrence below the waist?
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.380]   That's no fun.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:42.540]   That's why you want the manscaped lawn mower 3.0.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.700]   This sounds like I'm making this up, doesn't it?
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.140]   It is the, it is the greatest trimmer.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:52.220]   Actually, I've used it on all sorts of, uh, body parts because it is the greatest trimmer
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:53.220]   ever made.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:59.460]   First of all, ceramic blade, uh, cutting edge, but will not cut you.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.500]   And it is 7,000 RPMs.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500]   That does two things.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:09.260]   First, it makes it much smoother, much more reliable, much less likely to pull, chafe
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:13.020]   or cut, but it also is I'm running it right now.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:15.220]   It's, it's very quiet.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.220]   I could.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:21.220]   Oh, for those, for those of you who are listening and not having video, he is simply
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.580]   putting it against his chin.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:23.580]   This is good.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.580]   I decided to.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:25.580]   Use your imagination.
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.100]   I'm not making any visuals that you're.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:29.820]   Notice the LED light.
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:33.180]   Sometimes, sometimes the theater of the air is not the best venue for.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:39.380]   And this, by the way, I should point out this is not my personal lawn mower.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.380]   That's at home.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.500]   It says, it's, this is one that as far as I know has never been used.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.140]   This is sitting, uh, mine's sitting at home.
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.580]   It has a really nice USB charger.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.580]   So it's always ready.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.580]   It goes right in there.
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:54.060]   And you notice when I turn it on that bright LED light because you don't want to be spelunking
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:57.180]   without a little bit of a headlamp.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.460]   If you know what I mean, you want to see what you're doing.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:06.380]   Manscaping accidents are nothing to sneeze at or scream at.
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.340]   This is, this is an amazing thing.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:14.020]   Actually, what I have in front of me is the perfect package 3.0 and peak hygiene plan.
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.620]   Perfect father's day gift.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.060]   Dad will, dad will laugh.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.380]   Dad will enjoy it.
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:20.580]   It comes by the way.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.900]   This always, Micah had to explain what this is.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.500]   It comes with a newspaper.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.060]   And there's some good content in here.
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.180]   And I thought, oh, it's just some nice reading.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:34.380]   For instance, as you're manscaping, you might want to, there's a whole section here on different
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:38.220]   styles you might want to adopt than you're manscaping.
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.660]   But Micah explained, it, it, and I guess I should probably have read the manual.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:47.700]   This is for spreading out and standing on so that afterwards you can wrap it up and all
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:51.180]   the hair is easily disposed of.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.300]   See me didn't know that's what the newspaper was for.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.980]   I just went out on the back deck.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.460]   Gave the birds a show.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:07.700]   You also get this lovely shaving kit and you get a few of the lovely manscaping bombs
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.460]   because after all, a bomb is a terrible thing to waste.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.180]   This is the, the crop preserver.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.740]   I'll just let you imagine what it's for.
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.500]   And the crop reviver.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.420]   They smell wonderful, very masculine, very nice.
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.940]   Manscaping also has manscaped.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:31.140]   If you want to, if you want to prove that you have been manscaped, they have the manscaped
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:36.380]   boxer shorts, which are clearly branded.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.220]   I actually love manscaped.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.300]   I think this is your great product.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.860]   I, I believe in grooming.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:48.700]   And I think that your friend, your, your close personal friend, your significant other will
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:54.300]   also believe in grooming and will appreciate the effort you have made.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:34:02.260]   They will also appreciate the quiet sounds of the 7000 RPM quiet stroke technology.
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.300]   Do they really, they call it the quiet stroke?
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:05.300]   Okay.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:11.860]   They, it is quiet and it's smooth and it is lovely and you can show off your mower loud
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.500]   and proud right on that charging dock slash stand.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:21.100]   Oh, one other thing I really like about a manscaped, you could subscribe and get a new replacement
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:25.740]   blade, brand new ceramic blades every three months right to your door.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.620]   So your term are always stays fresh, clean and most importantly sharp.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:34.380]   If you're looking for a great gift without leaving the house, the perfect package 3.0

[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.740]   Andy, let's start with you because I think you have something I might be interested in.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:56.260]   Yeah, it's basically dirt cheap Bluetooth headphones that serve a need that I have.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:02.140]   Now my sleep schedule is really, really wacky for reasons that are easy to understand.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.940]   And so I don't want to bother the neighbors.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:07.500]   So I decided, okay, it's time for me to get like Bluetooth headphones so I can watch
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:12.860]   TV and listen to music at between four, five and six in the morning.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:17.420]   And so really what I was looking for, I just went to Amazon and I was looking for basically
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:24.020]   what is the cheapest set of headphones that ticks off a certain set of features like USB
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.540]   C for the charger.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:27.300]   Boom, it's got that.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.500]   I want super, super long battery life.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.020]   So I'm not recharging it all the time.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.420]   Boom, it gets about 60 hours of battery life.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:39.300]   It says advertise, all I know is that I'm recharging them maybe once a week and it's
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.300]   perfectly good.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:44.540]   I want controls on the ear cup so that I can do anything that I need to do, changing the
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:48.540]   volume, muting, turning things on and off.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.540]   Boom.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:54.580]   I wanted to have be compatible with high-res audio, also another checkbox.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:59.500]   I want them to be foldable so that if I do want to travel with them, they're not going
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.020]   to take up a huge amount of room.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.100]   Check the check bar for that.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.860]   It also does fast charging.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:09.300]   So if you do catch yourself unawares, you can get about five hours worth of charge in
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.700]   about five minutes of playtime.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:18.540]   And they do sound, and a Bluetooth 5.0 and a modern Bluetooth chipset.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:23.940]   The reason why I had to go shopping for headphones is that my old set of over the ear headphones,
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:28.580]   which is for me, the only kind that I could wear for more than an hour without having to
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:35.020]   just furiously like, scramble at my ear and then won't go into the shower and get whatever
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.780]   it is out of my ear.
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:42.740]   These are over the ear headphones.
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.420]   The previous set that I had, for some reason, they just kept disconnecting.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:49.380]   Like every couple of minutes just kept disconnecting.
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:53.020]   And I think it's because they were like five or six years old and they were like an older
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:55.660]   version of Bluetooth and an older chipset.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:57.340]   These were like dirt cheap.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:03.460]   They weren't the cheapest over the ear, Bluetooth headphones on Amazon, but they were damn close.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.700]   They list for 40 bucks.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.260]   There's a coupon for five bucks off.
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:12.700]   But for that amount of money, I enjoyed this first pair so much that I bought a second pair
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.420]   just for the living room, so I don't have to keep moving.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.340]   I kept to keep moving them from one room to another.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:24.180]   I really, really like this kind of technology where it's as cheap as they could possibly
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:30.220]   get it without limiting any of the features that you really, really need to make it a
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.740]   successful device.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.700]   And so for that reason, that's why I bought one and then I bought another one.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:38.060]   Yeah, I think Anchorage did a lot of really good stuff.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.900]   It's interesting because I don't think the profit margin on any headphone is very, very
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.900]   high.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:47.740]   So instead of just doing that big markup, they're just saying, "Well, we can actually
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.540]   sell it at closer cost."
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:52.540]   And they sound really nice.
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:58.380]   It does have a nice compromise between, it does have super, super mega bass, but it's
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.380]   actually a button.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.660]   So if you don't want the super, super mega bass, you can turn it off.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.180]   And it also has an analog jack.
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:07.780]   So if you want them to use them as wired headphones, they'll work just fine as wired
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:08.780]   headphones.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:10.540]   So very, very happy with it.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.940]   I'm glad to see that Anker had a product like this because I've never, I bought lots of
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.980]   Anker products and I've never been disappointed with them.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:26.460]   They really do seem to know how to build a commodity product at a cost that doesn't
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.460]   make you regret.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:31.540]   There are lots of really, really cheap stuff out there and they'll work great for three
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:33.620]   months and then you have to throw it out, replace it.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:38.380]   And so therefore then you've lost whatever you amount of money you save by the $25 one
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.540]   instead of the $50 or $60 one.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:43.500]   So that's why, okay, it's an Anker.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:44.500]   Good.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.500]   We're done.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.300]   Yeah, they make this Soundcore speakers.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:51.100]   They make the earbuds, earbuds too, that are very affordable.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.100]   I think very good.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.100]   I think Soundcore is actually a good brand to know about.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.820]   So thank you for that recommendation.
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:59.820]   Alex Lindsey, you got a good one.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.820]   I like this now.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.980]   IGTV, is that still around?
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.180]   There it is, I think.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.460]   No, it's still, people are still streaming.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.460]   Okay.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:13.100]   So, you know, people are streaming to Instagram and the problem with Instagram right now is
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:18.260]   that you can only, typically you can only stream to, with your phone.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:23.580]   So you're stuck with your phone to, you have to, you know, so you can't really build a
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:27.540]   switcher or you can't do graphics, you can't have real fun.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:30.820]   So the, you know, the folks at Instagram are not about fun.
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:32.660]   They're about making it a pain in the neck.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:37.660]   So anyway, so the, so I recommend that we all download Yellow Duck.
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:38.660]   Yes.
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.900]   What Yellow Duck does is it takes into account the, there's a backdoor where you can find
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:46.380]   the direct RTMP input and stream to it.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:52.220]   And so you can actually stream directly to your, you do your Instagram live from, you
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:56.540]   know, you can stream directly into the, into the backdoor of, of Instagram.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:01.700]   Now technically I will tell you that this is against, this is against the, yeah.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:07.100]   Anyway, it, it, this is technically against the terms of service of Instagram, but I don't
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:11.700]   know of anybody who has ever been punished for it other than it's not the most stable
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.100]   connection to Instagram as not as stable as the phone.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.500]   So it's against, it's technically breaking the rules, which is why I think that we all
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.500]   should do it.
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:24.220]   So, because Instagram's policy on this is stupid.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.300]   It's, you know, it's, it's like just flat out.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:28.540]   So really, this isn't even really software.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.540]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:34.140]   It just gives you the RTMP URL and a stream key for that.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.780]   And then you can put it into your, and then you can put it into your favorite streaming
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.340]   tool and use that to do the actual stream.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:42.340]   Exactly.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.100]   And I think that it's important that all of us should download it and, and consider it
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:49.700]   our, you know, our little push on Instagram that they should open that up and, and allow
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.580]   us to just do RTMP streaming.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:54.380]   So I think it's really important for all of us to download Yellow Duck and use Yellow
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:55.380]   Duck.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:57.140]   Use Yellow Duck as often as you can.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:01.540]   And, you know, and, and, and really just see how many streams that we can get going into
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:04.860]   Instagram live from, not from a phone.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.980]   So I'm, I'm here today to promote the idea that we should all break the rules.
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:15.100]   So Yellow Duck is breaking the rules with Instagram, but it makes it much better show.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.700]   And I think that they deserve it.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:17.700]   Why not?
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:18.700]   It's free, right?
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:21.940]   It's just a simple, you know, apt to do a code.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.500]   I wouldn't do it for a high profile event because it, again, it's against terms of service.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:29.860]   And I have, I have seen events get cut off and, or, or drop off for whatever reason.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:32.780]   They're not going to help you if it, if it does, and it's not something that they decently,
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:36.380]   but I don't see them closing in anytime soon because there's too many high profile people
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.380]   using it.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:42.660]   So they don't, they can't really, their hand is kind of stuck in the till because they,
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:45.820]   it's against the rules, but they can't close it without making some pretty important people
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:46.980]   pretty upset.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.540]   So, so we should take advantage of that.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.020]   And just, and just, and just thrash and push and.
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:56.780]   Adicurioses is, is there, what if there were a way to open up the Instagram stream on your
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:59.060]   phone and then somehow get the video into your phone?
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.620]   Is there any way there is?
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.980]   So we built, we've built ways to do that.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.820]   It's not as, it's not as, so the other way to do it that, that doesn't break terms of
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:09.460]   service is to mount a phone against the monitor.
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:13.260]   So you literally mount a phone that's pointing right at the monitor.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.260]   Right.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:17.020]   At, at the, at a very specific, you know, you have to figure out the exact distance for
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:18.500]   that phone at one X.
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.220]   You don't want to make it wide or long.
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:24.980]   You just do it at one X and you set the phone and you mount that phone.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.700]   It has to be perfectly perpendicular.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:30.700]   And then what you do is you tent it all the way around it so that the phone doesn't have
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.460]   any, any exterior light.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.900]   And then when you shoot it, you won't be able to tell on Instagram that, that someone's
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:36.900]   job.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.020]   We've done, we've done that solution for years.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:44.660]   We started doing it with, um, Mirkat, you know, because Mirkat and Periscope, uh, had
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:46.100]   the same, same restrictions.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.460]   And, uh, and so we got really good at it.
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.660]   And it, and so for clients, because clients would be like, we have to, you know, our CEO
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.620]   have, he loves to do stuff on, you know, if you're going to do something like that,
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:58.340]   we have to do, uh, you know, have to do that.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:01.500]   So we would, we would do things that looked pretty much identical except suddenly it looked
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:06.020]   a lot better than the phone because we were using, you know, super 35 cameras and switchers
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.540]   and graphics and everything else, but it was going through the phone.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:13.940]   And so, yeah, so that can be done for both, uh, you know, TikTok has the same issue.
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:20.500]   So, but so you can use, uh, the phone kind of the analog, you know, bridge, uh, can be
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.420]   done with the phone with TikTok and with Instagram, but yellow duck works with Instagram directly.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:27.020]   So you can do that too.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:31.900]   How are you, how are the, how is the kids, uh, TikTok stream doing?
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.900]   It's been slow.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:36.780]   The problem is that there, that, that I, I got a, I got a job again and I was, I was
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:37.780]   going pretty slow.
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:43.740]   And so it was all fun and it was all fine and dandy, but, uh, then I got us to know I work.
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:46.860]   Well, and then it was, then it was like, it was going to be a really relaxed job.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.460]   You know, it was like, you know, I'm going to work on big jobs and do all these other
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.460]   things.
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:55.140]   And then of course when you're a specialist in virtual events and COVID hits, now it's
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:57.340]   seven days a week, 12, I'm staying.
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:58.340]   Really?
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:00.340]   So it's, yeah, that's good.
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:01.340]   I guess.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:02.340]   Right.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.340]   It is, it is.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.340]   I get to get the work on a lot of really fun jobs.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.340]   So, so, um, yeah.
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:11.020]   So, so, so you're saying the problem is you don't have, you don't have the time to be
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.020]   a showbiz dad anymore.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:15.020]   Exactly.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:18.140]   You, by the way, I got, we got, come on, you slept for three hours.
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:19.140]   Come on.
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:20.140]   Drink your coffee.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.140]   We got, we got to be on set.
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:22.140]   We actually got it.
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:24.140]   We had a great opportunity to do one with ILM last week.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.620]   If you, if you go up to ILM, industrial light and magic, YouTube channel is the discussion
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:36.660]   with Dennis Mirren and Phil Tippett and Joe Johnson and Lauren Peterson and Bill George.
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:40.980]   So they, they all discussed the making of empire strikes back.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:44.460]   So it was an, you know, it was an online, you know, a COVID discussion.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:50.860]   And it, it, anyway, we got to play on that one and it was, it's an amazing conversation.
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:54.100]   If you haven't seen it, it's, it's pretty awesome.
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.820]   So you're going to, this is going to be a huge opportunity for you because you, this is,
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.020]   this is everybody's doing this now.
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.020]   Can't wait.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:06.420]   And what you'll see there, by the way, is for you to, if you spend a little effort,
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.500]   effort, this isn't like any big cameras or anything.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.380]   These are just good web cameras and relatively good audio lighting lighting.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:15.060]   No, yeah, we had a little lights.
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.300]   We had some, we had some little lights for this.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:22.580]   So it was a, so, but it wasn't, it wasn't a very expensive kit and they, they looked and
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:26.020]   sounded, I think pretty, pretty good.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:30.140]   So it's, and, and more importantly, it's just a, and you'll see there was a blue elephant.
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:34.460]   We, when we were, when we were working with Lauren to get ready for this, we were like,
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.140]   there was, you can see the other one up at the top of the frame and we were, there was
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.780]   two of them up there and we were like, bring one down, bring one down.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:41.900]   Just, if, don't talk about it, don't point it out.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.260]   And it's just set it there, you know, and, and finally people figured out about halfway
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.660]   through that it was an L, it was a, it was a model from Jumanji.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:49.860]   Oh, it was a, it was a.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.580]   It was a little hysterical and you could, and you could look at Phil's forever.
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.980]   Phil's in, Phil's room and then it's amazing.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   Oh my god.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.620]   And then, and Bill George's got, you know, yeah, and just, kill our conversations.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:06.620]   I mean, there is some really, um, uh, fun conversations that they, that they have that
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.580]   are, that are pretty cool.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.020]   So anyway, I would highly recommend it.
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:16.180]   See everybody says don't think of a blue elephant and I keep thinking about a blue elephant.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.660]   I don't understand it.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.740]   That is on, uh, I'm sure we're going to get a take down, but that is on, uh, ILM's YouTube
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:27.100]   feed, ILM VFX.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.060]   And, and you just edit that out.
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:33.180]   Uh, it's like, there's no audio.
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.180]   Right.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.140]   So you think it's without the audio, the content won't, we got taken.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.820]   Oh, no, I heard what happened recently is that they've made changes to content ID where
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:45.300]   if it detects a longer, a long enough amount of contiguous video, it's not even, there's
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:48.980]   no even humans involved anymore, it just content IDs them immediately.
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:51.820]   Um, and so you can, you can prevent it by switching more often.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.060]   So there's no continuous series of videos.
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.220]   That's exactly what I did.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.020]   I, I, when I was amazed at it, is there was an event that we did recently that someone
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:03.020]   sent us something that was them on the video, but we just didn't realize it was owned by
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:04.020]   somebody else.
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.500]   And, and so it, and we were just moving fast.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.500]   It was last minute.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.500]   They gave it to us.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.860]   We played it into the show and of course it got content ID'd.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:14.220]   And what was amazing was it says, if you'd like to fix this, you can just cut it out.
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:16.580]   And so I just said, okay, go ahead, knock it out.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.460]   And edit was actually really good.
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:22.780]   I was like, it just was the host goes, and now we're going to see a video.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:23.780]   Wow, that was great.
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:24.780]   You know, like it was.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.780]   But there was no glitch.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.780]   There was no whatever it was.
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:31.820]   You mean, you did it on YouTube, it actually did it for you.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.580]   It did it for you on the scene change.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:36.940]   So it was like, so it literally, it was the host was like, now we're going to see the
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:37.940]   video there.
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:38.940]   It wasn't that great.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:42.100]   And it was, and it was a funny, it was a funny clip, but it did it, it actually did a
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.020]   pretty good job of pulling it out, which is much better than it used to be because once
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.500]   it was there, we couldn't get it up.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.580]   You know, we couldn't get it.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:48.580]   You have to repost it.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   It's a big thing.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:50.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:51.580]   It was a big thing.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:55.260]   So being able to cut it out at least was better than I know they had that feature.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.740]   I didn't know either until it happened.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:00.580]   We got my, the tech I show on Saturday got taken down because I was, we were watching
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:05.140]   the NASA launch and of course, NASA's video is public domain, but the National Geographic
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.620]   decided they should own all NASA footage.
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:13.140]   CNBC claimed a bunch of people who were there paying for the streams from NASA as well.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:17.420]   So, so to be clear, I just want to, as someone who does this a lot, it's, it's probably not
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.860]   as nefarious as it sounds.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:20.420]   So it's automated, I understand.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:23.940]   It's all, you're building, when you build the event, it's just set to a certain thing.
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:28.780]   And there's an overall setting for all of your videos within, as an owner, you know,
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:30.340]   as the, as a channel.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:34.260]   And so if you're not paying attention to it, it's very easy for like bars and tone, which
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:39.620]   is, you know, just color bars and hearing, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's taken
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.620]   down a lot.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:46.580]   You put that on a live feed and you'll get a, you'll get a ping from like Paramount, NBC.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:51.580]   There's a whole bunch because, and now what it was is that it was on some show, it was
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.500]   the beginning of some show that they put up and it just, it just happened to be in something
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:58.580]   that they, that they claimed the whole show and it just happens to be there.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:49:59.820]   And so it gets, it gets picked up.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.740]   But that's why we had to build, start building creative versions of that, bars and tones,
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.740]   make sure that we kill us.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.740]   We can run them in tests.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:10.340]   That is automated content ID is ridiculous.
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:15.220]   National Geographic realized or YouTube realized and the video was back up like a day or two
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:16.740]   later, but that's a lot of.
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:17.740]   My guess is that are gone.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:21.820]   My guess is the reason it was there too later was probably because they, because they couldn't
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820]   find the person with the admin account.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.980]   Like, no, I'm not, I'm not kidding.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:32.380]   It wasn't just me, a lot of people, including NASA itself.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:35.300]   And so they got, it was a little bit of a black mark, I have to say.
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:39.500]   I know you and I understand why it happens, but it's not a good thing.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:42.700]   Yeah, I don't understand how.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:46.500]   So there's, I can't get into it too much, but there's processes that that didn't need
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.500]   to happen.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.940]   Like there's, there's things that NASA could have done to make sure that didn't happen.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:50.940]   Oh, okay.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:55.580]   But why shouldn't NASA or I or anybody have to do that?
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:56.580]   That's stupid.
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:57.900]   It's not equitable on YouTube side.
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:02.020]   Like these companies lose nothing by making just blanket, blanket, you just question.
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:03.460]   They, it's no disincentive.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.460]   I know.
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.940]   Things work, things work better for people who decide what works versus what's fair.
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.860]   So, so like, so, so you just have process.
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:16.860]   We have definitely a process is for high, high, high, high, high visibility events that
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.740]   would make sure that that didn't happen.
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:19.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.980]   And there's ways to do that.
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:23.380]   So there's, there's, there's ways to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:27.340]   If I watched your office hours, could I learn those methods?
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:28.340]   Not that bad.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:32.820]   I can't talk about too much, but there's a, but you would like a private conversation
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:33.820]   at some other time.
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:34.820]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.140]   Because I sure would like to know we get it.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:37.620]   It happens way too much to us.
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.020]   And it's, it actually costs us money.
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:43.460]   Fortunately, I didn't build this business on YouTube views.
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:48.540]   There is a guy who did though, Mr. Renee Richie, but all his contents original, it doesn't
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.540]   hurt him.
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:50.540]   Right.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:53.340]   You know, no, it does because I show clips from Lake Apple and Samsung.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.620]   And all these other companies.
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:57.820]   And I've learned to keep them very short to move between them a lot, to change them up
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:58.820]   a lot.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.220]   And you have to be careful.
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:05.180]   And I attribute everything on screen and in the description.
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.180]   That's your view.
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:10.220]   And would help if we're humans, but I don't know if it helps with automated content.
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.580]   No, but I mean, like, I think the default wisdom now is like, like, unless you did something
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:18.340]   wrong and you know you did something wrong, just protest immediately.
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.340]   Yeah, we do.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.340]   It's loudly immediately.
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.860]   And most often the company knows like, Oh, why?
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.940]   No, we're not going to waste a penny on this.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:25.940]   Right.
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.940]   Good.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.740]   What's your pick of the week, Mr. Richard?
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:31.140]   So I have to admit, I've been struggling with this a lot lately.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:35.380]   And you know, I've been told to stay in my tech lane and also like is my job to provide
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.380]   escapism.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:37.380]   Yeah, you're not a human.
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:38.380]   You're thinking that there's stay in your tech lane.
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:40.660]   Yeah, no, I'm a dancing robot monkey.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:45.700]   But like I also am cognizant of the fact that for a lot of people, like escapism is a luxury
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.700]   of choice that they don't have.
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:48.700]   Right.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:52.820]   So I want to make sure that as much as I continue to do what I'm doing because I have commitment
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:56.700]   and I have to, you know, I have to show up and do the things that I promise to show up
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:02.620]   and do that I'm also trying to use whatever voice I have to share other people who have
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:05.580]   much better things to say right now.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.340]   And this is a Twitter video.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:12.580]   It's not a YouTube video yet as far as I know, but it's a Twitter video called uncomfortable
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:15.180]   conversations with a black man.
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:21.420]   And it basically just starts stepping you through almost Q&A style from his point of
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.420]   view.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.660]   And I think it's safe to say the point of view of a lot of people.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:28.220]   You know, why things are the way they are from their point of view, why they feel the
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:32.980]   way they feel, the sort of struggles and challenges that they have because a lot of
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:37.620]   people, they just, it's so hard to get that point of view.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:42.060]   And I think if everybody stops and thinks for a moment, there's always been some point
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.660]   in their life where they felt, you know, lessened or held down.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.580]   And it's only been a moment.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:52.820]   But a lot of people deal with that every day, every moment of every day.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.660]   And once you can make that empathic connection and you can actually start listening, it's
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.780]   incredibly educational and transformative.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:05.180]   And he does such a great job and he's just beginning.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:07.060]   And I really hope he continues.
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:12.700]   But just to start off that conversation from, you know, not everyone, not everyone, certainly
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:15.940]   there are people who are problematic, but some people are just ignorant and not in like
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:20.740]   the insulting terms away, but in the classical term that we just don't know any better and
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.100]   you can't fix anything if you don't know.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.860]   And so stuff like this is just invaluable.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.460]   Yeah, I'm glad he did this.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:30.460]   This is great.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.100]   I'm actually watching it right now.
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:34.100]   This is really good.
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.100]   Renee, you are really good.
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:40.140]   Everybody should subscribe to your YouTube channel because God knows that's a hard way
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:42.660]   to make a live in YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:46.820]   Of course, you're doing the right thing, which is you're putting out excellent content.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.380]   And I think in the long run, that's how you win.
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.340]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie is @ReneeRitchie on Twitter.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:56.300]   Did you retweet Emmanuel Atchos' video?
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.300]   Yes.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:01.660]   So if you go to his Twitter feed, you can get that.
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:02.660]   I'm not doing tech today.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:03.780]   I'm not doing any videos today.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:06.180]   I'm just trying to amplify as much as I can today.
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:10.500]   And also, you know, it's a struggle because some people think you should be silent and
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.380]   some people think you should speak up.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.820]   I'm trying to do a little bit of both because I'm also cognizant that I can get away with
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:18.660]   saying things that people who are in these situations can't.
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.900]   And it's part of all of our jobs to take those hits when we can take them as well.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:27.620]   So I want to try and get as, I want to be as, create as much space as I can, but also
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.140]   help occupy that space as much as I can.
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.140]   Yep.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.140]   Yep.
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:33.140]   Yep.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.140]   Let's see.
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:35.860]   Thank you, Andy and Aco.
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:41.020]   Are there going to be on WGBH Boston this week or is this week time out?
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.820]   I'm in the timeout corner this weekend.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:50.660]   This Friday, the governor needs my half hour for, I don't know, talk to public interest
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.660]   stuff.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660]   I don't know.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:55.940]   Apparently, as a pandemic and also there's outrage in the streets.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.380]   Apparently, that's more important than whatever I was going to say.
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.380]   I'm not here to question.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:01.300]   I'm just, I just do as I'm told.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:08.260]   But I'm going to be next week at my usual time of Friday at 1130am@wGBHNews.org, stream
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:09.260]   it live or later.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:10.260]   Nice.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:17.220]   And of course, Alex Lindsey's office hours are every morning bright and early.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.060]   Find out more on his YouTube feed that's youtube.com/AlexLindsayly.
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:31.260]   His other 20 hours of the week of the day, I should say, are devoted to 090 media 090.media
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:34.020]   and he's on Twitter, Alex Lindsey.
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.500]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.940]   Nope, that's it.
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.940]   Good.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:38.940]   Thank you for doing those.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.940]   I got it.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.100]   I'm going to set the alarm tomorrow.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.580]   It's just fun.
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:44.900]   I like sleeping in.
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.820]   I don't know what it is about that, but I do.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:48.980]   I like getting up.
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:49.980]   I'm up here.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:50.980]   You were really worth 40.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:53.740]   I really like, I really like a couple hours of dark.
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:56.420]   Like now, especially in the summer, you have to get up really early so that you have a
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:57.420]   little bit of time in dark.
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.660]   I like to see this on, I have a nice view.
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.660]   I really like to see the sunrise.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.540]   So, we thank you all for being here.
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:06.620]   We hope you stay safe.
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:13.700]   You stay well and you help make the world a better place this week and every week.
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.820]   We're glad you could spend this time with us.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:17.540]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:22.300]   Every Tuesday, around 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:26.100]   If you want to tune in and watch, you can.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:33.060]   It's a live video and audio stream goes all the time at you to, sorry, twit.tv/live.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:38.540]   That actually is aggregation of all the different live feeds because there's several.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.140]   You can pick the one you like.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.140]   It's going all the time.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:44.260]   If you want to listen to live audio, you can also ask your Amazon Echo or your Google
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:49.780]   home, you know, play Twit Live and it'll, you know, whatever's going on at the moment,
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.780]   it'll play that.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:54.500]   So, it's a nice way to get some people in your house talking at you.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.260]   You can also chat with our chat room there.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:59.580]   They're 24/7 at IRC.twit.tv.
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:06.340]   After the fact, our show goes up on the website, twit.tv/mbw for Mac break weekly.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.140]   You can download audio and video there.
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:12.500]   We're also on YouTube if we haven't been taken down.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:15.380]   And, you know, you never know.
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:19.940]   There's other stuff there too if you, I hear, if you can't find Mac break weekly.
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:25.020]   You should also, if you would, subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.260]   That way you don't have to even think about it.
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:27.780]   You just say, "I got some time.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.500]   Let me listen to Mac break weekly.
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.380]   We're here every week for you."
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:32.380]   Thanks for being here.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.940]   And we will see you next time.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:38.100]   But I'm sorry to say it's time to go back to whatever it was you were doing earlier.
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:42.740]   If it's work, go back to work because break time is over.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.740]   Thanks everybody.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:48.940]   Hey folks, I am Mike Asargent, co-host of Tech News Weekly right here on the Twit Network.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:53.500]   Yes, Tech News Weekly is a show we do every week, Jason Howell and myself, where we talk
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.300]   to people who are making and are breaking the tech news.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:57.300]   That's right.
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:02.380]   It's journalists, it's inventors, it's app makers, it's everybody who's bringing the
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:04.060]   tech news in a given week.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:05.900]   It's all the stuff you want to know about.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:09.860]   In bite-sized chunks in a fantastic package.
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:13.020]   So be sure to subscribe to twit.tv/tnw.
