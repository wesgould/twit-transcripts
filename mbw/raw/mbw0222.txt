[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.840]   Here he is in the room with us, Mr. Alex Lindsey,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   the Pixel Core.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.160]   Hello.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   Pixel Core.com.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.000]   If you want to find out more about that great multimedia
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.480]   GilBixacore.tv for the podcasts, of which they are so
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.600]   famous, we're doing more live streams.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.760]   We had a whole lot of people.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.200]   How did that go?
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.120]   It went great.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.600]   We talked about that last week.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.920]   And we're going to be doing more streaming this weekend.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.000]   If it all works, so you need to follow me or follow the Pixel
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   Core on Twitter.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   We'll Twitter it.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.000]   But if it works, we're going to have two cameras on a camera
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320]   car, a car hooked to the back of Kelly's all-in-one truck.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.400]   So we're going to car dragging behind it, not dragging,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   but following behind it with a jib moving around it
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.200]   to shoot some shots.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800]   And we're going to try to stream both the witness cameras
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.600]   and the main camera.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.560]   By a live view?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.520]   By a live view.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.400]   From the truck.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.280]   So it'll be for half an hour hour.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.440]   You'll get to see what that looks like.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.480]   But follow us and we'll Twitter it if it's working.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.920]   Who?
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.600]   Also with us from the planet Hoth.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.480]   Andy and Otko.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.400]   Chicago's Tubes.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.960]   I have one small bit of prepared comedy
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   that I'd like to execute at this time.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.400]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.920]   OK.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   Please.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.560]   Theator's going to send Imperial Walkers.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   Let them.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   Because you know what?
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.080]   Imperial Walkers, they're just pieces of junk.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   They're going to hit the side of a--
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   one's behind me now, isn't there?
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.160]   Lovely pieces of engineering.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   So stable in forest environments and vloggers.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.280]   Mr. Hasbro.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.520]   And that's the prepared comedy.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.320]   Now open the table for Q&A.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   So you do look like you were at a piano bar on the planet Hoth.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.080]   Can you explain what happened?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.680]   Well, you see, you get an email from someone
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800]   you know in industrial life in magic who says,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.560]   you need a backdrop?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.720]   Well, I can send you a backdrop.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   I've got a backdrop like hanging around the office.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.400]   If you want a backdrop, I mean a backdrop.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   You can give me a backdrop.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   It's not a big problem.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.920]   It's not a big problem.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.840]   That's an ILM backdrop.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.720]   That's, yes.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   The letters that accompanied it tells me
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.280]   that ILM made this specifically for a DVD interview
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.240]   with Dennis Muren, who did the Imperial Walker
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.320]   sequences on an empire strikes back.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.480]   That's pretty neat.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.120]   So he's also one of the top visual sex supervisors
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.200]   in the world.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.560]   Wow.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.080]   Exactly.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.400]   He's in Demi God.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.920]   He's the guy.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.720]   He's the guy that like every kid in his neighborhood
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.360]   who knew what he did for a living, every trash day,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.200]   his trash would be totally picked apart,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.240]   looking for just like one little, one little leg
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.760]   or one little piece of bot.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.000]   There's got to be a wookie in here somewhere.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.960]   Exactly.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.040]   So yes, it's--
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.960]   So the last nice project was that you have no idea
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.160]   how big this thing is.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.760]   I mean, I can't--
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680]   if I-- this is a--
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.720]   I'm not going to go see a lot of you.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.120]   Are you on the porch still or you're somewhere else?
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.240]   I'm still-- see, this is far back as I can go.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.800]   But it is--
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.280]   I can't.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.080]   It is 90 inches wide by 40 inches tall.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.440]   I bought some lumba last night at the home depot.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.200]   And I built myself a big frame.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.080]   Now what you want to get is like a scrim style frame for this,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.760]   because you're not going to tack this up with no fun tack,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.160]   because it's a really nice piece of pasta.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.800]   That's really, really, really, really, really, really looks great.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.120]   I have to say, now what is in front of you?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.840]   It looks like a copy stand or something.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.720]   What have you done here in front?
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.440]   This is actually the screen that I use every week
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.320]   to see exactly what you guys are up to.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   So we just never saw it before.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   You just never saw it before, because normally, like--
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.680]   this is like the video hour on ZSETV.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.120]   Normally, my shot is like this.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.480]   Right.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Right.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   It's tight.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.560]   It would hardly be-- it would hardly be--
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.280]   show you the prowess of the altering
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.000]   and the armor transport if I were tight like this.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.480]   And so--
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   Not too far out.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.920]   Zoom in a little bit, because here's the deal.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.120]   When I put you with Alex, it looks like you're
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.800]   a god on Mount Olympus looking down at him.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.560]   I think that might be the--
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.400]   You're going for that.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.000]   That might be the point.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.320]   Is that the look you're going for?
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.840]   Yeah, about that goodness.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.200]   That'll work.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.040]   Do whatever you want.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.600]   I like it.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   I think it's great.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   OK.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   It's a great shot.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's a great shot.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   [HONKING]
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.240]   Not whatever you want.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.920]   So--
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.720]   iOS 4.1 is out.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   Hazah Hazah Hazah Hazah came out on Monday.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.880]   Delayed, I think twice.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.240]   I think it was--
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.160]   I think they really did want to get it out
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   on the day that the rumors said they wanted to get it out.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.880]   And then there was another rumor that said they
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.320]   want to get out last Friday.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.200]   Finally did come out.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.960]   And if you have an iPhone or an iPad, you can now update.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.760]   Commence the update.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.920]   Commence the update may commence.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.320]   I have it here on this Mac.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.160]   And of course, it's got the features
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.520]   we expected from the iPhone.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.760]   It's got folders, which is really handy.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.200]   And it's exactly like the iPhone implementation with 4.1.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.240]   You also have the-- if you double tap the home button,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.160]   you have the multitasking apps all listed out there.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.000]   And then on the left, if you scroll left--
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   and this is one thing that's unique to the iPad.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.200]   We no longer have the hardware scroll lock button.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.240]   That's been turned into a kind of sort of mute button.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.040]   It doesn't mute everything.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   Well, so now the rotation lock.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   So now the rotation lock is in software there.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.720]   This is unfortunate because the mute button--
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.280]   well, for instance, it mutes sound effects,
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.480]   but it doesn't mute Pandora.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.520]   I guess it's supposed to be analogous to the iPhone mute button.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.800]   Yeah, which is stupid because the phone is a device
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.600]   that by its nature is going to make noise unexpectedly
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.880]   when you don't ask it to.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.160]   That's not what the iPad does.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.760]   The iPad is going to rotate the screen unexpectedly
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.080]   when you don't ask it to.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.040]   So boy, I've got 20 bucks.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   It says that they're going to at least make a user option
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.840]   in a future version of iOS that lets you choose that
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.000]   sometime in the next six months.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.800]   Oh, I think Steve Jobs just says, no,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   and this is how it's going to be too bad.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.000]   Or more likely.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.720]   Well, we were going to do that, but since you're
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.000]   being a bunch of jerks about it, no, we're not going to do it.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.160]   We're not going to do anything.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.680]   Really?
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.120]   Yeah, it is.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.880]   I do like-- now there come some things I like.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   I do like the fact that now we have a brightness setting
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   right there so it's always available.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.080]   You don't have to go into settings.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.320]   You could do it in settings before.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.400]   But now it's right there.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.200]   The play controls for--
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   I guess it really only works for iTunes.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.720]   I don't know.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.200]   Volume level here.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   This icon maybe shouldn't just be--
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.240]   well, let me see what happens if I play Play Play Play.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.800]   Does it change to something else?
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.640]   It's supposed to be a Play deck that
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.280]   will work with anything that's doing streaming audio
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.320]   in the background.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.880]   So if you have the updated version of Pandora,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.840]   I haven't used it myself.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.240]   I don't have to like that.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.280]   If it's 4.2, Studley should be able to control playback
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.520]   through that taskbar.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.080]   Well, let's see.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   OK.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.600]   I've got the very white radio on.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.560]   And I'm going to double tap.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.480]   Turn your face way down.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.040]   And you're saying that this should be when I slide left--
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   yes, it is.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.320]   It's the Pandora app.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   So now this controls the Pandora app
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.800]   as opposed to the iTunes app.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520]   So it's showing you what audio app is working there.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.000]   Right.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.720]   That worked pretty well.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   That was nice.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.320]   So now if I change to, say, the Victoria's Secret app
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.560]   for no apparent reason and start watching some Victoria's Secret
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.800]   video, it's kind of all--
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.680]   it's whatever-- it's unknown, right?
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.280]   We don't know what's going to happen.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:46.720]   Let's see.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.920]   I don't know how I'll play it.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.280]   And we'll see.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.720]   I mean, realize that the iPad is one audio at a time.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.200]   So whatever app has control, the audio
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.280]   is supposed to be up there.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.400]   It's back to the iPod, unfortunately.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.320]   However, I'm back to the Victoria's Secret fashion show.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.200]   Tuesday, November 30, 10 p.m., Eastern, 9 p.m., central,
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.440]   only on CBS.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.200]   Sorry, guys.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.520]   That's it on that.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.040]   Oh, that's OK.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   You know what?
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.840]   They sent you all that big box full of man size underwear.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   You got to give him the plug.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.960]   You got to put it in.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   You got to give him the plug.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   It's right there in the store.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.400]   I'm done.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.120]   Victoria's Secret plug right here.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.880]   Actually, I'm going to do a couple of plugs
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.800]   before we get right into the rest of the news.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.920]   One is that Gary Vaynerchuk's going to come up tomorrow,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.680]   4 p.m., Pacific, 7 p.m., Eastern, to do our one hour--
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.600]   we're doing these Twit Talks now, which is really fun.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.640]   Tom Barrett and I are talking to interesting people in the biz.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.560]   And Gary is certainly interesting with his Wine Library TV
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.720]   and his book, Crush It.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.200]   I saw him at the gas station.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.640]   He's a good speaker, really.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.600]   There's a couple of gas stations here in Petaluma
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.720]   that have video screens at the gas station.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.280]   Oh, man.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.680]   And it's right off of East Washington.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.200]   There's a couple of the 76--
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.320]   Is it Wine Library on the gas station?
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.440]   Well, it was Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.600]   I don't know if it was Wine Library,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.800]   but it was like, that's--
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.040]   Hey, you're bumping gas.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.760]   You might want some great wine tips.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.520]   No, no.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.080]   And you know what?
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.640]   It was kind of fun to sit there and watch them.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.560]   I was like, really?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.760]   And then I was like, oh, this is kind of nice.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.600]   And I just sat there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.760]   And we are in Wine Country after all.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.840]   You're filming a little time.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.560]   And anyway, I thought that was kind of funny.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.080]   So we're also doing-- we're not going to be here, though,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.520]   with a week after Christmas.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.480]   I hope you guys know.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.760]   You won't be too bereft.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.520]   I'll show up.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   Where is he?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.880]   I'm kind of just close.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.960]   It's locked.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.480]   I don't want to-- I've locked.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.920]   I brought my new slot car set.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.640]   I thought we had to enjoy it.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.160]   OK, you can bring your presence over,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.760]   but we're not going to do a show.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.040]   I think we should compare presents.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.960]   Yes, exactly.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.560]   But what we are going to do is a best of,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.440]   and if you'd like to vote for moments from the past year
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   that you thought were worth repeating, funny moments,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.160]   silly moments, light moments, heavy moments, serious moments,
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.320]   sad moments.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.880]   We don't have a lot of sad moments.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.760]   Well, we have that one where Steve Jobs kicks my ass.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.480]   Well, there's that.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.680]   But what did we film now?
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.040]   No, we never got on tape.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.760]   But you go to twit.tv/bestof, and you
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.400]   can vote for your favorite moment.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   And the more information you give us, the more likely
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.840]   we'll actually include it.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:13.880]   So talking again about iOS 4.2, multitasking and folders
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.680]   the most obvious thing.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.560]   But of course, printing, finally.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.400]   Air printing.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.800]   Only some apps support it right now, but I guess Andy,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.400]   am I wrong?
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.320]   But apps can add this.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.040]   It's like multitasking.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.800]   Your app has to be upgraded in order to support it.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.160]   But yeah, it's a built-in feature.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   As a matter of all the core apps already supported.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.960]   If you go into mail, for instance,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.920]   when you choose the button that says,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.400]   send the someplace else, in addition to forwarding your email,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.040]   you can also print it, stuff like that.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.760]   It's really nicely integrated.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.400]   It really speaks to how well pre-plan the iOS interface was
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520]   thought out, that you don't have to have a separate print
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.720]   command, a print button, or print menu that, OK, we can just
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.960]   slide this right here, and it'll just
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   work just fine.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.880]   It's in that export button, or mail button, or add bookmark
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.000]   button, that does the box with the arrowy thing going out of it.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.760]   Yeah, it does multi-duty in a lot of different things.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.480]   Now, in order for me to print, I have to be sharing a printer
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.840]   on another computer.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.080]   Is that right?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.400]   No, what has to happen is that-- well, it
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.200]   depends on how you do it.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Now, the air printing system is actually just a simple extension
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.960]   to the cup system, the printing system.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   Oh, it's cups.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.600]   Oh, right, exactly.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.680]   It's built into Unix.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.400]   Now, so out of the box, the consumer answer is, however,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.800]   that you need to have a special printer that
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.600]   is compliant with the standard that Apple's promoting for airplay.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.320]   Right now, the only company of any note, I think, that actually
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.960]   has a number of printers like that, is HP.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   However, solution number one is that if you happen to have a
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.720]   friend who's a developer, if you can just grab this, the special
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.160]   files from a special system directory that basically
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.840]   tells the printing system, here's everything that an
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   air print device needs to know in order to hook up to any
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.120]   printer that's hooked up to this machine.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.760]   So if you have a friend like that, then you can just simply
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.520]   copy these, I think, three files into the right directory.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.840]   And suddenly, all devices that you have, the support
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.360]   air print, will be able to find that shared printer that's
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.560]   connected to that Mac and print.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.440]   Because I use network printers both at home and here.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.160]   The Epson Artisan at home and in Epson multi-function laser
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   printer here.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.320]   And both of them have ethernet, jacks, or Wi-Fi actually
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.800]   in the case of the Epson at home.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.440]   So they're on the network.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.960]   So if I had the proper driver, I'd be able to print to that.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.640]   Well, it's not a printer driver.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.280]   It's just the question of--
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.240]   Software.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.360]   Just telling cups, here's what--
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.760]   essentially, it's a little extension to cups that simply
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.520]   tells-- it puts out on the network the thing that an air
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.680]   print device wants to see in order to say, oh, here's a
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.920]   printer that I know how to deal with.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.640]   If I have my printer connected to my airport express, will
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.240]   that be something that I can--
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.520]   That should be something I should be able to print out of,
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.200]   right?
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   Right.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.480]   Well, again, the consumer answer is that you can only work
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.200]   with a printer that is directly supported by this print
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   standard.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.440]   All it has to do is to be available to the network.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.360]   And it will work.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.880]   I think-- I haven't tried it myself.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   But I think that it should work by that stretch with the
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.080]   USB port on any shared Apple networking device.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.520]   But right now, that's the consumer answer.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.600]   There's also-- my pick of the week is actually an app that
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.040]   will deliver that functionality to any Mac running.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.360]   It's really nice little utility that has ex-functionality.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   Oh, I was not going to mention that.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.720]   OK, good.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.080]   I'll leave that out.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   So later--
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   So we'll use that as a teaser to keep people listening.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.080]   That was it, though, right?
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.520]   That was it.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   OK.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.600]   All right.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.520]   Unless you're listening.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.200]   And then you have no idea what--
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.800]   It's possible to do this.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.400]   And so we will talk about that.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.320]   Now, there's another feature to iOS for this kind of--
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.560]   Hit and miss.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.920]   And that's AirPlay.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.720]   Yes.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.240]   So with AirPlay, the theory was, anyway, that you could--
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.640]   I guess it will be eventually, if more apps support it.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   But you could play-- if you have a video on your device,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.080]   it could be a Mac or it could be an iPad or an iPhone,
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.720]   and you have a new Apple TV on your TV,
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.560]   you can play video from it.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.360]   Which is great.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.520]   I mean, there's something that I wanted to be able to do
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.320]   almost immediately.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.920]   Right.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.440]   Is be able to pop that in.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.120]   Because you want to connect it.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.080]   But am I too nice to do this?
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.800]   Have you played with it?
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.680]   Because I did.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.160]   Yep.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.520]   I was using it all day yesterday.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.360]   Worked to treat.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.440]   Works for audio, works for video.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.560]   I just absolutely loved it.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.080]   So it does work.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.600]   It does work.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.400]   I have the Apple TV.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.000]   You do have to update your Apple TV to 4.1 OS,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.520]   which also hit yesterday.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.160]   But it's like AirPrint, where an application has to specifically
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.320]   support it.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.840]   It will work with audio and video.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.280]   There are some circumstances under which it will not
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.680]   work with video.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.880]   For instance, it works in a cool way.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.640]   We're here in Safari.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.200]   There's an embedded video player we're all familiar with.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.600]   That standard embedded video player, which pops up in so
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.440]   many applications, that's part of an Apple operating system
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.800]   operating system dealie.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   And that supports AirPlay built in so that a lot of your apps
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.880]   are going to get that feature for free.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.000]   However, there's still the problem of making sure that the
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.720]   video that's trying to play is encoded in a format that the
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.480]   target device knows how to deal with.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.440]   So for instance, if you're trying to play videos from an
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.120]   embedded-- if you're looking at a blog in Safari and you want
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.320]   to play this video that's embedded and you want it to go
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.720]   to your Apple TV, the Apple TV doesn't know how to--
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.200]   excuse me, as far as I understand it, the Apple TV
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.800]   doesn't know how to deal with certain codecs.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.320]   And so you'll get the audio, but the video will still be
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   playing on the iPad.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.920]   Does the apps normally--
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   Good, go ahead.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.920]   So that's why you get the audio only, in some cases.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.440]   Because it's a codec issue.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.360]   It's a codec issue.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.240]   It's not as simple as-- as I understand it now, and
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.480]   unfortunately, I've been a little bit laxing, finding out
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.560]   exactly how AirPlay works.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.280]   This is all in the past 30 hours that morning about this.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.600]   It's not as though the Air iPad will transcode this video into
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.520]   a brand new format that is AirPlay compliant, that will be
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.040]   playable on every single device.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.000]   Supposedly, it simply diverts the stream, ghostbuster
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.920]   style into the target device.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.160]   And if the device does know how to deal with it, then it
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.760]   communicates back to the iPad.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.560]   OK, dude, I know what to do with this audio, but the video,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.760]   you're totally on your own.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.400]   But that doesn't mean that you're going to see--
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.320]   If VLC-- I guess VLC would have to be updated for AirPlay.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.920]   Yeah, well, VLC barely works as it is.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.840]   It does something like keynote.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.280]   Is something in keynote aware?
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.520]   So could you theoretically run a presentation on them?
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.640]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.280]   I don't know.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.160]   I haven't tried keynote yet.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.840]   One of the things I was looking at is that you could
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.280]   theoretically hook an Apple TV to a projector anywhere and
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.440]   then be able to just connect and run your presentation off of it.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.280]   That would be great.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.640]   From what I understand from the developer documentation,
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.720]   there aren't a whole lot of limits to what you can do with
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.440]   AirPlay.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.920]   So if keynote wanted to turn an AirPlay device into--
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.120]   Apple TV into a presentation target, it could do that.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.280]   If a third party slideshow or photo app wanted to do that,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.440]   the traditional--
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.880]   Now the loving, happy, married couple comes into the photo
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.400]   studio and sees the photos of the blessed day, that sort of app.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   Then yes, in theory, there's nothing stopping the developer
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.200]   from creating that kind of feature.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.600]   Apple has opened the API.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.400]   Can you connect to more than one airport at a time?
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.760]   Not at a time.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.640]   However, it is very, very--
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.720]   it's very, very polite in how it deals with the concept of
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.440]   having multiple devices, all of which want to talk to that
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.600]   same Apple TV.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   So for instance, if I'm listening to music that's being
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.600]   driven from my iPhone on the sofa next to me,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.280]   the sofa cushion next to me, and I'm just listening to it
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   right there, and then I'm also on my MacBook, and I want to
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.040]   start playing video from iTunes onto the Apple TV.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.720]   As soon as I click on the AirPlay button here, it'll tell me,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.320]   oh, I'm sorry, that device is already in use, try again.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.480]   But the moment that I click pause on the iPhone, or the
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.320]   moment that that playlist ends, immediately the AirPlay says
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   the Apple TV realizes that, OK, I'm not doing it right now.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.720]   I'm available to anybody who now wants me to use it.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   So I don't have to log off of it.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.640]   I don't have to disconnect from it.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.480]   It's just a big funnel with a point that goes into the Apple
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.520]   TV, and although one person could be using it at a time,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.200]   anyone who can shoot video into that will get the Apple TV.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.320]   It's really very cool the way that works.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.400]   One other limitation, I think John Gruber noted this on
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.000]   during Fireball, is that the video that you shoot on iPhone
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.400]   4 is not playable oddly enough through AirPlay.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.920]   And he theorizes just too big.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.360]   It's 10 megabits a second.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.840]   That's very possible.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   The only videos that I had on my iPad that I couldn't stream
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.640]   were an HD version of Up, where I got a gorgeous first frame
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.400]   of where I had paused the movie.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.440]   But after that, just the spinning wagon wheel of
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   Intemperance, so that was it.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.440]   I mean, if you think about it, you're going over Wi-Fi.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.480]   Yeah, it's pretty gnarly.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.520]   Although you'd be surprised.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.400]   This is the demonstration of how cool this feature works.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.640]   I went out to Home Depot to buy my Wumba last night.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.400]   I was listening to a podcast on the drive back.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.520]   And then when I got back in, normally, when I got back in,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.800]   all I had to do was just simply just
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.960]   continued to press pause on the podcast I was listening to.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.240]   And then just simply click the button to activate AirPlay,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.040]   select the Apple TV, and then the podcast continued
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   through my home theater speakers while I was cutting up
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.600]   wood and building this thing.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.840]   So it wasn't-- normally, it would have been the sort of thing
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.200]   where I have to unplug some speakers, plug it into this thing,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.640]   or redock and restream it from another device.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.920]   But the idea that it really does work
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.640]   is, though, it's just a wireless set of speakers
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.920]   and a wireless video that you can just connect to disconnect
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.480]   at will works incredibly well.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.920]   You know, it'd be really great to have that in my car.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.240]   You know, when I think about it, because that's the missing--
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.400]   I mean, because I have a lot of--
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.640]   I'm listening to Audible Books, and I'm going from car
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.840]   to my headphone and then into my house.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.960]   And there is that little bit of a plug-in, plug-in, plug-in,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   plug-in as I--
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.760]   We had Ford as a sponsor today.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.680]   Because it works really well.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.360]   Oh, right.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.800]   With A2DP and a sync.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.080]   I get in the car, and the book starts playing.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.680]   When I get out, it stops playing.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.200]   Works really nicely.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.520]   So it's really a car thing, I think.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:26.960]   It is.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.160]   It would be--
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.000]   Oh, it's a car thing.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.080]   I got the wrong car.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.160]   I got the wrong car.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.560]   You're saying there's something wrong with my nine-year-old car?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.080]   Oh, no.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.400]   He's got a brand new one.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.840]   His car.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.880]   Oh, I have a--
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.840]   Plenty of things wrong with it.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.080]   Well, I'm looking at a Leaf next year.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.640]   Nissan.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.760]   You know, I've got to think that all the car manufacturers
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.360]   are going to get a little better about this.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   The sync was ahead of its time, but I've
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.000]   got to think that they realized this is what everybody wants.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.480]   I guess I really wish they would just
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.160]   build an input for my iPad.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.040]   I don't need them to stop thinking.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.440]   You know, Ford is doing it right.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.880]   So if they keep on coming the way for it--
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.600]   If they have a USB jack, it plugs into the--
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.440]   I'm saying, just give me the--
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.480]   I don't mean a USB jack.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.360]   Just give me the--
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.520]   If you put the sync cable in the USB jack,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.160]   then you get in and you plug in your iPad.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.960]   Well, I want--
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.480]   It plays everything.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.160]   So where my GPS screen is?
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   It has controls for all this.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.400]   I just want an iPod connector.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:17.960]   Oh, you want--
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   I just want to go-- I just want to stick it in and then
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.680]   close it in.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.600]   Here's the thing--
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.400]   Here's the thing you're saying.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.600]   You want an in-dash iPad.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.720]   This is the thing that I think a lot of manufacturers
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.080]   are missing.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.520]   We were talking about this a lot on Twitch,
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.840]   because my whole thing is that some manufacturers are
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.000]   going to get smart about this.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.400]   And they're going to realize that people like me--
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.560]   and there's a lot of us now.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.640]   A lot of us have about iPads.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.520]   A lot of us have iPhones.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.040]   We want that to be our interface to everything else.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.520]   So stop making these stupid little LED
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.040]   whatever that you're working on.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.160]   You have a whole bunch of engineers,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.800]   and it all comes out looking like crap.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.840]   So here's the thing is just let me literally build an iPhone
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.360]   version.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.400]   Don't believe me.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.880]   Continue to make your little piece of crap
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.680]   that you put into your CRV or into your whatever.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.240]   But just humor me and create an iPhone connector.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.920]   And an SDK-- here's the thing.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.200]   Build an SDK for your car, and I have an SDK for the iPhone.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.640]   And then let people build apps on the iTunes store that
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.960]   do all kinds of things with your car.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.520]   That would be nice.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.720]   And suddenly I have this incredible creativity
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.040]   that would explode.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.440]   And that's the same with cameras.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.200]   That's what Ford says they're going to do.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.080]   They're going to support an apps layer.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.720]   There's already a bunch of really cool hardware devices
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.240]   you can get that work by a Bluetooth.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   You know that there's a diagnostic connector
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.640]   in every single car made since '99, right?
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.480]   I want to be able to change the fuel air on my car
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.800]   with my iPad.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.640]   See?
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.800]   They're not going to let you do that.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.400]   I can tell you right now.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.280]   I would read through the terms of service
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.360]   on that very, very carefully.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.480]   Because if you ever want to get an insurance claim paid off
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.760]   for the rest of your life, they're going to say, oh, well,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.680]   we noticed that four of us before the accident,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.560]   two in the morning, you happen to exceed the RPMs
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.720]   and the speed limit by three miles per hour.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.880]   Never mind.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.480]   One other--
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.320]   No, you're talking to someone who so desperately
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.680]   wanted to have an iPad dash mount working.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.200]   And I got two or three things that--
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.040]   jury rig that could actually mount it correctly.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.440]   And a couple of different people
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.120]   sent me different things that they had built to get it working.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.720]   And I find that's not just a problem
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.520]   of getting it to mount on the dashboard
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.080]   and getting power and stuff like that.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.200]   It's such a big sheet of glass that if you don't have
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.640]   an immense hood over it, it's just not going to work for you.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   You're not going to find that one angle you can find.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.160]   Exactly.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.000]   On the iPhone.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.480]   So I'm just like you and that I really
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   do want better support for phones in my car.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.520]   But I'm wondering if everybody's choices are so idiosyncratic
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.040]   that you can't do a built-in that everybody's going to like.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.400]   Well, but I think that I don't think it's built in that everyone
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   likes.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.960]   I think just give us the option.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.480]   OK.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.320]   Just allow it.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.600]   Just make it one of those in APIs.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.840]   Oh, just an API so we can get things like engine speed,
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.960]   engine temperature, things like that.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.560]   Yeah, I mean, like, you know, any--
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.320]   yeah, I don't need to really do the fuel air.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.760]   I mean, what I'm saying is that it would be great
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.960]   though to get the diagnostics.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.280]   There is ODB software for the iPhone.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.880]   But you have to have a hardware connection as well.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.640]   But being able to click it in and then
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   be able to control my stereo and my interaction.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.320]   But then people could get real creative about it.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.360]   I have to tell you, having talked to Ford engineers
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.600]   about this, the real key for them is isolating your computer
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.000]   from the car computer.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.920]   They really, really don't want to get a liability situation.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.680]   And they really don't want hackers.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.760]   You read that story where hackers were using the tire
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.080]   sensor to hack into the car computer.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.400]   They really want to keep that car computer isolated
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.320]   from the outside world.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.280]   So I just think that we have to sign a whole bunch of things
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.320]   when we want to go on there.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.720]   And you're not going to do that.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.040]   I'm quite happy to tell you I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.240]   However, what they've done with sync-- and I'm sure all the guys
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.480]   that people do-- is essentially have an isolated system.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.680]   And what sync smart is because it uses your phone.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.560]   It says, look, your phone's going to be more up to date
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.520]   than we could ever do because it's the third or four year
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.000]   development cycle for a car.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.760]   So we'll just make sure that we tie into the phone.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   And I think they do do a good job of that.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.720]   And I think that doesn't have to be a direct link to my car.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.400]   But I do think having that interface
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.720]   of being able to get the information--
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.040]   Get the information.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.840]   I'm looking at--
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.680]   You could build an SDK that just gave me--
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.120]   These are the things you can program.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.880]   I have it around here that you plug it into your ODB3.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.160]   It downloads the data from it.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.960]   Then you take the SD card and you put it in your Mac.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.080]   And you get all the data there.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   Oh, but I want to have it--
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.720]   Yeah, I know you want it on your iPhone.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.160]   I want it on my computer.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.280]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.760]   When we come back there is more good news for iOS 4.2
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.040]   and some bad news too.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.600]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.240]   Mac Break Weekly is on the air with Alex Lindsey.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   Andy, you not kill me?
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.800]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.600]   And I'm here to tell you about Go to a meeting
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.000]   from the great folks at Citrix.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.400]   Go to meeting.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.520]   Eliminates all that business travel.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.680]   We're all sick of doing.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.720]   You're going to Rwanda.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.600]   I am going to Rwanda.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.400]   You've got to talk them and let you use Go to meeting.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.880]   Well, we're going to be using it a lot as we get going.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.080]   So I'm having a meeting.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.040]   I need to have some face to face.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.560]   You have to do face time.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.440]   And then you--
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.280]   But we are literally--
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.520]   And we use Go to a meeting or variant of it every week
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.720]   for a lot of our meetings.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.400]   And we have people all from all over the world
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.080]   going to this-- that we bring in for these meetings all the time.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.320]   And we're going to run huge parts of our education
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.440]   process, isn't it?
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:20.940]   Oh, man.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.440]   It's the future.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.520]   We're going to be teaching students in Rwanda in Kigali
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.200]   from my Petaluma office.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.280]   That's why I'm building the grid.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   We're going to be doing classes from there
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.040]   in there using the software.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.200]   You just go to webinar or something like that.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.720]   Go to webinar is what we use.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.200]   That's the-- Go to a meeting has 15 people in a meeting.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.600]   If you want to do something larger, you're going
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.840]   to have bigger products.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.160]   Go to a meeting though.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.640]   Mac or PC doesn't matter.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.960]   Cross-platform, you can be holding the meeting on a Mac
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.720]   and be meeting with somebody on a PC.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.400]   And by the way, you can trade control around.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.560]   So if you're doing trainings like Alex is doing,
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.240]   you can show them on your computer.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.720]   And then they say, let's see, you do it.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.040]   They can either control your computer
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.480]   or you can look at theirs while they're doing it.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.720]   And they can type in questions.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.080]   And we can--
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.800]   Yeah, they can raise their hand and a lot of other things.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.000]   Built-in teleconferencing, voiceover, the internet,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.640]   and phone teleconferencing free.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.520]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.720]   This really is a great product.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.880]   It's a world-changing product.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   There are other choices.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.960]   I know, but this is the easiest and the best way
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.560]   to find out is to try it free for a month of unlimited online
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.000]   meetings.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.280]   Just visit go-to-meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.280]   Within a minute or two, you'll be set up and ready to go.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.200]   And the next time somebody says, let's get a conference call.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.640]   You can say, I got a better idea.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.920]   Let's go to a meeting instead.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.160]   Much more effective.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   Really does a great job and saves you a lot of money.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.120]   Go to meeting $49 a month.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.520]   That's about 5% of the cost of a single business trip.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.440]   Unless you're going to Rwanda, and it's about 1/1/10th of 1%.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   I can only imagine what you spend in airfare.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.000]   It's a little over $2,000 round trip.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.840]   It's not bad.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   It's not bad.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.680]   It's too hot.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.640]   It's a long flight.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.680]   Brussels.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.320]   You fly to Brussels, and then you fly straight into Kigali.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.360]   I don't know how you do it.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.760]   I'm going to--
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.200]   You got a cocoon.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.320]   Oh, you go business.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.480]   No.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.800]   So when you say cocoon, you have a little tiny, tiny,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:02.960]   see--
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.480]   I have a mental--
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:03.960]   I have a mental--
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.720]   mental-- mental state.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.160]   Mental state.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.640]   No, I just get into a mental state where I just don't--
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.320]   I stop moving, and I just kind of like just go into it.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.200]   Little bit of a trance is why people use good, meaning she's
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.040]   Louise.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.520]   So I like this.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.200]   Let me praise Apple for doing this.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.000]   I use Find My iPhone all the time,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.920]   but in the past, you've had to be a mobile meme member.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:26.200]   The new iOS 4.02 makes Find My iPhone/IPAD free to everyone.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.880]   This is a great feature.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.000]   And if you've not used it, I could show you.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.120]   As long as my kids aren't watching.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.720]   Because, by the way, it's not just for finding your iPhone.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.400]   It's for finding your family.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.640]   There's--
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.160]   there's a Harry Potter clock in one of the books where
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.200]   every member of the family is like a hand in the clock,
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.080]   so they know where everybody is and when they're coming home.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.040]   And I thought, why that would really be cool.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.160]   Well, all you have to do is give your kids iPhones,
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.600]   and you can do it too, or iPads.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   You're the--
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.040]   I realized, so if you wanted to put one in your car--
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.320]   this is after I lost my car, and I wanted to know where it was.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.440]   So the cheapest way-- so I did some research,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   and you could load Jack your car.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.760]   And that's going to cost you $150.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.200]   Hear me out?
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.520]   It's going to cost you $150.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.320]   And a couple things.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.360]   $150, $49 a month, or $39 a month.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.400]   And every thief knows exactly where to go to disable it.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.520]   So if you buy a 3GS for $99, and just leave it in the car,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.080]   family plan on AT&T is $15 a month for every added thing.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.240]   So you could just leave it in the car, somewhere in the car.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.360]   And you would literally-- if it was powered--
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.280]   I mean, if you found a place to power it or whatever--
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.080]   for $15 a month, you'd have a low jack.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.760]   That's actually a much better interface
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.240]   than the one that comes with the $50 for your car.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.840]   I love this.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.280]   It is fantastic.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.720]   So I could see my sons at school, which is good.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.520]   I could see where Abby is.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.760]   It's all the fun out of--
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.480]   --ditch in school.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.520]   My wife, my iPad, and my iPhone.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.280]   And then you also-- so this is a GPS.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.360]   Obviously, if you're not sure from the map,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.120]   you can see from the satellite information.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.200]   There's a school I can tell.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.160]   I can zoom in.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   The circle's kind of neat.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   That shows you the confidence radius.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.000]   And as time goes by, it gets smaller as it zeros in on it.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.960]   But I know he's somewhere in this radius.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.440]   There's also, if you press the I button,
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.400]   there's some things you can do.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.880]   You can display a message or play a sound on the phone.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.240]   That's so you can say, hey, please give me my phone back
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.840]   or play a loud sound if you're trying
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.520]   to find it in the seat cushions.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.480]   There's a remote lock and a remote wipe.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.840]   This is a great feature.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.560]   And I've been using it for a while since I have a Mobile Me
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.160]   account.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.360]   Now you don't have to anymore, which I think is great.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.640]   It can be a little bit frustrating, though.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.120]   Last week, I think Mark Wade, whose name is going to be
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.800]   familiar just by every comics fan out there,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.520]   he did one of the best runs of the Avengers and the Flash
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.280]   ever.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.880]   But he left his iPad behind on a plane.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.600]   And frustrating as hell because he could see exactly what
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.560]   hotel whoever found it had brought it to.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.600]   OK, but really, it's frustrating because the GPS
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.960]   can tell you that it is within this building somewhere.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.680]   But you can't tell the local place,
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.480]   hi, can you send someone to do a door to research
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.000]   the best Western until you find someone who has an iPad
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.800]   and then have them like started up to see if it has a Flash.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   It won't do a floor.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.040]   For instance, it doesn't do height.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.320]   So it could be anywhere on 10 floors in a tall building.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.280]   We lost a phone in a field.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.840]   And it's not immediately obvious how to find--
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.600]   But you turn on the--
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.280]   Well, I never heard the sound.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.040]   I turned on the sound.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.680]   I never heard it.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   So I don't know.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.400]   I wonder if it doesn't turn on the sound, even if it's
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   unsilent, you must.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.320]   Yes, even if it's in silent mode, it will make that noise.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.480]   All that happens is that as long as it's charged, it'll work.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.440]   I just think this is a really--
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.360]   It is great.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.880]   If anything, there's stupid things that--
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.000]   whenever I worry or wonder about something
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.960]   that I may or may not have done, stupid,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.080]   there's always that list of, OK, it's almost impossible
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.320]   for you to be so stupid as to leave your phone behind
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   somewhere.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.000]   But you like to have that verification that so long
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.400]   as it's somewhere inside the house,
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.600]   I don't know what problem is.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   As long as you do-- if you do, they find my iPhone,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.840]   you realize that, OK, it's centered somewhere
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.880]   around my office building, so I know it hasn't been stolen.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.160]   I didn't leave it at a restaurant.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.240]   I just left it at my desk or something.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.520]   So I can see that my iPad is right where it is.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.400]   Right there.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.320]   It is a miracle feature.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.600]   I don't know if you're watching the new version of Sherlock.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.960]   Sherlock Holmes, it's on a PBS Masterpiece Theater.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.200]   It's exceptional.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.760]   And of course, on the first episode,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   Watson locates Sherlock who's in a bit of trouble
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.120]   by accessing the MePhone website and using the MePhone feature.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.880]   That's pretty funny.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   Mobile MePhone.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.360]   Yeah, Sherlock Holmes is modern.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.640]   In case you're wondering how they had phones in 221 Baker's
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.840]   to be, it's the modern version of this.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   It is such a great feature.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.040]   Anyway, free now.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.920]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.680]   You know, I was talking to a police officer
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.640]   when we lost your car.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.680]   And so evidently, even here in Petaluma,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.760]   two or three people have their cars
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.200]   absconded with every week.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.040]   Oh, really?
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.880]   Stolen?
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.720]   Really?
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.400]   And so it's not unheard of.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.800]   Not unheard of.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.440]   But a lot of people do what I do, which is just lose their car.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.280]   So anyway, you know, my CRB--
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.800]   You was here when I left it.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.960]   My CRB is officially the largest thing I've ever lost.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.240]   And that's not the most expensive thing I've ever lost,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.080]   but it's the largest--
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.440]   That's a big hole in your pants pocket if you lose a car.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.960]   I lost a car.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.400]   But only for a couple of hours.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.680]   Bad news.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.080]   Some people are reporting their music disappears
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   with iOS 4.2.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   There does seem to be a fix for that
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.320]   if you have disappearing music on your iPhone.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.120]   It's not a race.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.920]   You just need to re-sync.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.040]   So the date is there, but I guess that maybe the index
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   or something gets mongued.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.000]   Apple Insider has an article if you want to know more.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.120]   And I guess there's a thread on the Apple discussion groups
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.040]   that says what to do.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.800]   I don't know, so I can't tell you.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.760]   Resync.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.600]   Resync.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.680]   It'll be right enough, isn't it?
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.280]   What more do you want?
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.800]   I was a little perturbed, and I don't know--
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.840]   There's a big download, too.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.680]   It was--
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.000]   Yeah, I had bangs or something.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.880]   I think it was more than that.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.800]   Yeah, it was huge.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.520]   And I was a little perturbed because all my folders were lost.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.400]   I had a-- oh, man.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.120]   Reorganized.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.840]   These were all in folders.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.560]   So--
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.840]   Sorry.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.760]   No, because you spent a lot of time.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.920]   At least the folders--
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.320]   now it's a lot easier to organize.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.680]   I was super organized with my iPhone,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.320]   and then I updated it at some point in time,
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.160]   and it all the folders were lost.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   And then I was like, now it's not been quite the same.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.320]   I was just like, oh, I'm going to do it.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.080]   Right.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.400]   Yeah, so you know it's a mess.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.880]   No, I don't want to play anymore.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.800]   In every day.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.400]   I'll show you.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.200]   I'll just stay disorganized and unhappy.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.000]   That'll learn you.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.840]   Oh, wait.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.640]   No.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.720]   User slouch sock 8 says, here's how you get your data back.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.840]   Connect the phone to iTunes via USB.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.080]   Play a song on the phone itself from iTunes.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   You know how you do that, like with iTunes?
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.240]   It's in the lower right-hand corner.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.920]   You say, play this through the iPhone.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.520]   Click the sync button, then, to re-sync the phone.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.320]   Open the iPod application on the phone
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.440]   to rebuild the music library.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   I don't know how he figured that one out.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.720]   That's just goofy.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.120]   This is, by the way, 421.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.720]   We don't know why 4.2, the original Gold Master, was not released.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.120]   I'm still having Wi-Fi connectivity issues.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.440]   One of the things I noticed when I updated is it lost--
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.680]   it didn't stop noticing my automatic connect Wi-Fi,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.960]   and I have to manually say, when I got here, it didn't see it.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.080]   So I'd manually say, I'm here.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.760]   Now I presume from now on it'll know I'm here.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.120]   But just something to be aware of.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.840]   You might be on 3G.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.240]   Probably it's very important to be aware of that
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.400]   if you're up at your limit.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.200]   And already, there is a jailbreak.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.680]   Boy, that didn't take long.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.440]   Those guys are industrious.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.720]   Unbelievably, the iPhone Dev team released the newest update,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:07.880]   Red Snow version 0.9, 0.6, B4, Mac and Windows.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.000]   So if you want to jailbreak, the only reason I could think of
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.040]   is for tethering, right?
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.400]   What else?
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.760]   Oh, you do use that God demo, right?
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   So you can--
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.160]   No, I don't.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.040]   Andy, that's--
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.720]   I gave up on it.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.400]   There are two things that I like jailbreaking for.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.960]   One is tethering.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.160]   I think if you already have unlimited--
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.840]   if you've been grandfathered into unlimited data use,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.960]   you don't want to do anything that would cause AT&T to say,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.720]   congratulations, you just violated your terms of service.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.000]   Oh, you can still have your iPhone,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.280]   but we're going to have to give you a brand new contract that
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   has a 2GB cap on it.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.800]   And the second thing is mirroring the screen, which doesn't
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.080]   work as well as the version that Steve has for his keynotes,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.320]   but even at three or four frames per second, it's good enough
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.000]   to show an audience what you're doing in your iPad.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.760]   We used it initially on iPad today, and it was just slightly
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.720]   lower res.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.360]   It just kind of didn't look quite as good.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.800]   So I just shoot the screen directly now.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.360]   It looks great when you're shooting directly.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.040]   Oh, yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.920]   It does look great if you have the right camera and the angle.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.080]   Somebody sent me a really nice stand for this particular purpose
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.200]   from Monavus.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.040]   Wow, that's great.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.360]   It's the AP design.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.120]   And it's like kind of the--
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   Can you adjust it?
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.120]   Super adjusting.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.000]   See these knobs so you can tilt.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.920]   And that's what I need for a camera is to get the exact right
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.640]   angle of incidence so I don't have any key stoning.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.680]   That's awesome, though.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.720]   And you know what's bright enough?
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.280]   If you iris the camera just right,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.400]   get the brightness just right.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.480]   The only problem is big, fat fingers.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.880]   But on the other hand, I think as you watch--
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.640]   It's very natural.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.720]   You want to see the fingers.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.240]   You don't want to see that little dot that they do.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.720]   The fingers are useful.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.520]   And I imagine if you put it on a--
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.800]   I think that's what they often do is
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.320]   they put it on one of those stands with the cameras that
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.680]   shoot down that they use in college and a place like that.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.800]   You can do that too.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.360]   Movement, what are you looking at?
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.120]   I'm a buying one.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.920]   What are you looking at?
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.440]   Here, just take a look at that.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.480]   I'm going to write that all down.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.080]   I don't even know.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.280]   I get a lot of that stuff in the mail.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.080]   I apologize.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.280]   You're coming to this office is very expensive for me.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.000]   I know.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.440]   Me too.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.360]   You come in and I have to buy Crap too.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   Mine are more expensive.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.080]   Your stuff is really expensive.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.920]   I get you back.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.880]   Let's see.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.440]   So you do have to update to Apple TV 4.1 to get that
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.680]   airplane working.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.440]   Some Apple TV users are saying they're
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.680]   having some strange color issues with Sony and Philips
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.400]   TVs, according to end gadget.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.920]   How did it look on yours?
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.280]   Andy.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:45.880]   Look, just fine.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   Mine's a Samsung though.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.360]   I don't know if that makes a difference.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.200]   Apparently, it's only those two models.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.560]   Airplay is working fine.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.760]   The only difference is that you can somehow--
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.400]   you can kind of see the limitations of the A4
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.800]   process from the iPad, because obviously you can multitask.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.400]   It'll airplay will work in the background
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.280]   while you're doing things in the front ground.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.240]   But there will be times of which you'll
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.400]   hear just a tiny little stutter.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.520]   Because you just tap something and ask your iPad photo
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.960]   when you're doing an unsharp mask.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.760]   And for one fraction of a second is--
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.520]   No, I'm good.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.000]   I'm good.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   I'm good.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.520]   I'm good.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.000]   Just a little bit of a--
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.080]   So there are videos on an gadget that show the effect.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   So I presume--
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.760]   I don't know why there's German music playing,
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.320]   but that's where it's coming from.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.640]   Although there's another thing that I'm
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.080]   trying to track down, unfortunately,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.360]   I can't find my adapter.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.280]   But some people are telling me that one of the coolest
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.760]   hidden features of the camera connection kit
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.640]   has been sort of quietly removed,
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.720]   where if you use the USB version of the camera adapter
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.680]   and you plug in a really good USB microphone,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.720]   you can record off of that microphone, no problems whatsoever.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.160]   A couple different people have told me
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.800]   that now under iOS 4.2, there are different power
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.000]   requirements for devices you're plugging in there.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.880]   So it no longer delivers enough power
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:11.080]   to tell a good microphone to maintain compatibility,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.760]   which I'm still trying to figure that out.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.480]   Again, I haven't seen it yet because I still need to--
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.120]   the last chance thing is if I don't find it by tomorrow,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.040]   I'm like, damn it.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.920]   I have to go to the Apple Store and buy another damn
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.440]   connection kit because I can't find it on damn it, Andy.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.000]   I have mine somewhere.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.920]   That's not what a higher life form does.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.880]   A higher life form keeps track of these things.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.160]   No, they don't.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.880]   Don't be foolish.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.200]   But I think we all agree that kind of suck
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.400]   of a feature that I know that a lot of people use it.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.520]   Oh, it's a great feature.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.920]   It's not advertised.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.560]   Let's face it.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.960]   I mean, it wasn't something Apple said.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.800]   Yeah, and to--
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   I don't want to be hasty.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.720]   One thing I haven't tried and failed to use it myself.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.320]   And secondly, maybe there's a good reason
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.800]   why they made that change as opposed to simply saying,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.840]   we just want to be mean because we're Apple.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.840]   Exactly.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.560]   Let's see here.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.320]   Rupert Murdoch will be our next story.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.480]   But before the Rupert Murdoch story--
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.520]   And his son is involved.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.240]   Is his son involved?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   I'm very curious about this.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.040]   I want to know more about this.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   But before we do that, I want to talk a little bit about--
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:17.800]   Backing up.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.960]   Backing up's very important.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.160]   We all need a backup.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.920]   We all need someone we can lean on.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:27.640]   I have network attached storage, drobos.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.000]   I've got a tonito plug.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.840]   I've got a pogo plug.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.960]   I've got every kind of backup in the house.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.680]   But I'm not foolish because I know if the worst happened
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.960]   and the house burned down, all that crap would get burned down
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.520]   too.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.480]   And then I'd be ever clamped for a lack of data.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.920]   So I also backup to the cloud--
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.760]   in the words of Microsoft-- to the cloud.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.480]   And that's with carbonite.com.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.640]   Works with Mac and Windows.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.160]   I know you don't care about Windows, but works with Macs.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.360]   Just great.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.160]   You install carbonite.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.400]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.280]   You don't even need a credit card if you go to carbonite.com/macbreak.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.800]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.680]   You install it immediately starts backing up.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.040]   Uses your internet connection whenever
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.120]   your online is backing up.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.480]   Now, if you have 100,000 megabytes of data,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.360]   it might take a-- it's dependent on the speed
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.560]   of your internet connection.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.120]   So please understand that.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.760]   Somebody said, I have--
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.840]   I think somebody sent me an email.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.360]   I have 250 gigabytes.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   And it's going to take a long time.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.240]   Well, of course it is.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.720]   If you had a bigger pipe, it might not take so long.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.640]   It's really dependent on that.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.000]   That's why I want you to try before you buy.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.240]   But once that first backup's done,
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.920]   then pretty much keeps you always backed up
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.960]   because you're not creating data that fast.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.240]   And it's beautiful because anytime something happens,
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.800]   whether you accidentally delete a file
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.480]   or you lose your laptop or your hard drive dies,
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.280]   you can just go online with your iPhone
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.240]   and get that data back.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.720]   You can go online with your Android phone or your BlackBerry.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.120]   Actually, I don't think they have an Android app yet.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.240]   But BlackBerry phone.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.040]   You can go online with any browser from any computer,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.280]   log onto your Carbonite account.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.880]   There's all of your data, safe as houses.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.720]   128-bit SSL all the time.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.640]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.040]   You can even-- if you go into Starbucks
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   and you're in an open access point,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.440]   don't worry, nobody's seeing your data.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.560]   And if you want more, you can use triple desk or blow
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.800]   fish encryption to even make it more private.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.440]   Only you have the key to that.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.280]   I can go on and on.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.600]   There's lots of nice features.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.080]   Carbonite really is a great solution.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.680]   I put on my daughter's laptop before she went to college.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.000]   And it's a nice piece of mind, I must say.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.040]   Go to Carbonite.com, use your offer code MACBRAKE.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.160]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.040]   And if you use MACBRAKE when you buy,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.440]   it's only $55 a year.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.680]   But we're going to save you even more.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.640]   Two months free when you use your offer code MACBRAKE.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.480]   Don't put this off.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.240]   Backup is so important.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.960]   I don't want it to be tomorrow.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.720]   You say, oh, I meant to backup.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.840]   I forgot to back up.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.040]   And now my drive's dead.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.840]   Oh, I don't want that to happen to you.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.280]   Carbonite.com.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.400]   Offer code is MACBRAKE.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.360]   I'm glad, Andy, that you've got some protective gear now on,
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.920]   because we wouldn't want you to have any problems with vision.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.760]   Yeah, I decided that I wanted to look a little bit more
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.960]   like a rebel background trooper.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.640]   Since I didn't have the goggles--
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.480]   since I did have the goggles near the table,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   I thought that, well, I'll just feel foolish
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.920]   if I don't put them on.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.640]   I did stop before getting the loose skywalker scarf
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.680]   that's sort of dangling down from one side.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.920]   That's very cute.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.480]   Did you have those or did you actually go out
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.040]   and get them to go with your walker?
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.560]   Well, you see, there's a good news bad news sort of thing
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.840]   in terms of making me look like an idiot.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.480]   The good news is that no, I didn't buy it for the backdrop.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.040]   The bad news is that I had it nearby
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.800]   because it was part of a Halloween costume.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.760]   Dot, dot, dot for my stuffed dog.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.160]   Anyway.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.680]   And you know what?
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.480]   I believe him.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.120]   Hi, I'm a grown functioning adult.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.360]   Nice to meet you.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.040]   And he's got-- yeah, that's a--
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   It's good.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.200]   [LAUGHING]
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.440]   Causing Wookiee Nises.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   [SINGING]
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.280]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:45:59.840]   Well, that's good.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.200]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.600]   I was number two.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.880]   If they couldn't find Jabba-- you know, Jabba was like a--
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.280]   staging a duplicate of Spoke, Navajo, and had the crazy boys.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.800]   Really?
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.760]   And so when they went to find him-- he's not an actor.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.600]   When they went to find him, there was a little trouble.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   Find him-- you know, tracking him down.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.440]   And so I was the pin-shitter.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.960]   I was secretly hoping--
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.080]   Do you think any of your dialogue appears in any of the movies?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.800]   None of my-- no, I didn't end up in any final.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.760]   I was in the top five for Jar Jar before they just
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.880]   decided to go with Ahmed.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.720]   And I was in the top three for Darth Maul.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.280]   And then I was also-- and I was number two for--
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.480]   I was so close.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   I am in the movie, though.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.960]   Oh, really?
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:40.880]   Where?
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.440]   So in episode one--
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.000]   In episode one, there is a shot
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.760]   where the camera droid is in--
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.440]   you know, it's kind of going across in the city.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.560]   And it's kind of floating along.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.520]   And there's a guy in orange.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.720]   This orange suit with a metal head helmet.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.880]   And he looks like he's talking to himself.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.160]   Well, I'm not talking to myself.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.280]   I was standing right next to Jonathan Rothbard.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   And they took him out.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.800]   Because he could see too much of his face.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.000]   So they rode him out.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.200]   But they left me in.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   I survived because I had a face mask on.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   I want the frame.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.680]   I got to find the frame.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.680]   But yeah, yeah.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.720]   There was a couple-- what would happen is--
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.560]   they need to actually--
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.760]   I believe it's probably just a frame or two, right?
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.640]   I got a whole second.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.440]   I don't think I got a frame.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.120]   I think I got a--
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:24.600]   I got a whole--
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.280]   And there's another shot right when Anakin--
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.320]   if you really look hard when Anakin finishes and wins the race,
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.960]   those see a guy with a hat.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.320]   It looks like a--
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.360]   just like a little-- I don't know what--
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.200]   little hat.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.120]   And you see him going like this, running behind Anakin?
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.400]   That's you too.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.000]   What would happen is is that you would get--
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.600]   you would get--
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.200]   we'd be working and someone would just come in and say,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.840]   I need you, you, and you.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   And then you'd go there.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.800]   And then they put you in.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.440]   The thing I was wearing was like a spray painted scuba suit
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.080]   with some--
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.760]   I mean, like when you actually look at these outfits close up,
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   they're kind of scary looking.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.480]   I mean, they're not particularly--
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.480]   They're meant to be--
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.360]   But they look fine on film screen, yeah.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.200]   So anyway.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.840]   Make it sound like getting constricted--
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.200]   constricted into the Korean army.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:10.700]   It is.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.680]   It's just like, I need you, you, and you.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   And then--
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.440]   I'm not finding the people's army.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.240]   And you get the army.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.600]   You get the afternoon off.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.680]   And you wander about in some kind of weird thing
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.800]   and go like this in front of the green screen.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.920]   And then you go back to work.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.080]   And you don't get a credit.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.440]   And you don't get any points.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.600]   That will help.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.420]   I will openly say that that's way cooler than my empars
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.480]   strikes back backdrop.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   Well, that way.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.920]   No way cooler.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.760]   That is way cooler.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.960]   That is way cooler.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.480]   Anyway.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   All right.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.340]   And in the cafeteria, like there are certain, like,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.740]   not with it people like realize that, chief, perhaps
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.860]   perhaps all day long, I will talk like this.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.780]   And maybe one of the sound engineers will hit me
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.980]   and put me in a movie.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:52.480]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.100]   What happens is--
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.460]   That could really annoy.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.020]   What really happens is that the--
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.060]   I'm not very pleased.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.420]   But that's chicken.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.940]   Extra chicken, yes.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.180]   If you put some more chicken that's meat in there,
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.300]   I would enjoy that very much.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:05.820]   Oh, really?
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.300]   You're doing sound design for the next--
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.460]   Oh, I did not have no idea.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.040]   Well, the--
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.280]   What happened is that they would need scratch voices.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   How they got to know that they would need you
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.800]   is that they would--
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.000]   they would need scratch voices.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.880]   They put out-- you get this thing on all messages going.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   We're looking for a couple of scratches for this and this.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   And so you go out and try out for a couple of scratches.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.400]   Once they know you can do scratch voices,
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.480]   then you start--
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.000]   Ian McKeg and I did all of the voices for the Senate,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.840]   Rotunda.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.400]   So it was like-- between the two of us,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.360]   we did like 30 different ones.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.280]   And I was like, wow.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   [SINGING]
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.780]   And then you have all these other--
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   [SINGING]
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.140]   And we just do each one.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.940]   And then send them all in.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.620]   And that's what's in the previous.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.620]   And then they get rid of one of them.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.980]   They're just in Cava to another one,
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.460]   this is Trini Lopez.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.660]   And now it's really cool.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.620]   So it's a James Basin.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.620]   Races and objection to the--
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   Sorry.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.980]   It was funny.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.140]   I had to do one where I impersonated Tommy Lee Jones.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.980]   And I did it.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.220]   Well, it was funny because I did it.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.320]   And he said, the wrong Tommy Lee Jones,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.560]   you sound like just like the one from The Fugitive,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.160]   which of course is what all I watched the night before.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   You know, I just totally--
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.920]   I didn't even know there was a wrong--
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.160]   I kind of argue with it.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.120]   I was kind of like, you know what?
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.240]   Tommy Lee is Tommy Lee.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.560]   Tommy Lee Jones is Tommy Lee.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.040]   But he said, no, that one sounds just like The Fugitive.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.960]   And the problem was is that that is what I watched.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.800]   There's a reason.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.640]   I was like, mm.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.240]   So Rupert Murdoch, now this--
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.680]   I don't think as far as I know has been confirmed,
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.980]   the Guardian had the story that Rupert Murdoch and Apple
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.240]   were going to create a tablet-only newspaper.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.600]   Now, there's some credence to this
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.440]   because Murdoch has said in the past,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.280]   we're going to do some--
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.120]   Oh, they've announced it now.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:49.960]   --some like this.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.800]   The Daily.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.640]   Well, I don't know if they've announced it.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.480]   I keep looking for--
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.320]   No, I saw it somewhere more.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.760]   --an official announcement.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   I don't know if there's an official--
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.200]   We were just talking about it on a twin this morning.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.500]   Hold on.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.240]   So he says it'll be--
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.720]   Daily, 99 cents a week.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.760]   99 cents a week.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.400]   It'll be written with the sensibilities of a tabloid
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.080]   and the intelligence of a broadsheet.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.200]   The broadsheets are things like the Financial Times
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   and New York Times.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.800]   But the New York Post folks, I think, are revolved.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.240]   He says he's going to hire 100 journalists
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.400]   and a half dozen or so--
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.080]   I think they should--
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.680]   I think they already have.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.160]   Really?
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.040]   That was in one of the--
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.840]   Well, and then the rumor was by end of November,
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.600]   Gruber quite rightly points out.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.720]   It's a little too late for that.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.600]   But probably December 8th or 9th, we will hear about this.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.120]   Would you buy a tablet-only newspaper?
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   99 cents a week is cheap.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.880]   The price is definitely right.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.040]   And I think that they'll get a lot of sampling at that price.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.600]   And if the delivery mechanism works really, really great,
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.400]   meaning I don't have to remember to connect and download whenever
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:54.960]   I feel like it.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.800]   If it just simply magically--
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.400]   this thing gets updated for me automatically,
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   that could be really interesting.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.800]   I could find $4 in my budget every month
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.080]   for a decent daily newspaper where I don't have to really think
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.560]   about how it goes.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.960]   Well, especially if that's the question.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   Is it going to be-- I mean, how good is it going to be?
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.840]   Well, I think the big thing is since they're making it
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   only for the iPad, hopefully what we're going to see
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.040]   is something that's really custom-made for the iPad
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.560]   or custom-made for a tablet.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.080]   So that we're not-- right now, what we've seen so far
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.800]   is when you subscribe, you're getting kind of--
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.840]   like the economists came out last week.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.040]   Anyway, so--
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.920]   But you have to buy each edition.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   But you have to buy every week.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   And how different--
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.240]   For expensive too.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.080]   Yeah, and so you have to buy each edition.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.720]   And it's really a-- it's kind of a sexed up.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.600]   You know, it's like-- we put a little video into it
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.440]   and we added a couple of--
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.600]   But it's still the magazine.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.040]   The opportunity here is to do something unique.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:42.560]   Something unique.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.200]   Something designed for the tablet.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.640]   Yeah, that's going to take full advantage of it.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.600]   So hopefully that's what we're going to see them kind of go down.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.040]   You think Murdoch's the guy?
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.160]   I think if anyone's going to do it, it's going to be them.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.720]   I mean, they're going to experiment with it.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.800]   They're going to pay walls.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.360]   So what I love is the time--
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.320]   Well, this is the ultimate pay wall.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.440]   Remember that this isn't an online magazine
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.800]   with an iPad component.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.720]   The only way you can get it is just exactly.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.440]   Which would be why they're interested in it,
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.920]   because they're trying to save that business model.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.680]   And I don't see why not.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.600]   I mean, this is one of the things I kind of was not--
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.920]   thrilled about with the iPad, is it encourages this kind of thing
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.840]   as opposed to a free and open web and the link economy
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.400]   and all of that stuff.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.920]   But you can still do that on the iPad.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.240]   And if somebody else--
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.040]   Yeah, and really will have to be something that's
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.880]   got to be really good.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.400]   I mean, I'm willing to pay for the--
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:30.880]   That's for the bottom.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.920]   I'm willing to pay for Wired.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.040]   I'm willing to pay for Macworld.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.520]   I'm willing to pay for the economists, not much anything else.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.280]   Although the wider folks have said that the sales--
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.520]   Well, sales isn't bad.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.440]   But they're really expensive.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.120]   I mean, that's the problem is that what one of the things
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.800]   they're doing right, I think, with this, if the rumors are true,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.080]   is that they are charging a number that makes sense,
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.280]   given the fact that they're not printing or sending anything
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.240]   out.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.080]   That makes sense for me to go--
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:54.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.840]   And at $0.99 a week, if it's a subscription
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.240]   to perpetuity, I'll forget about it.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.640]   I mean, I won't even remember that I'm
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.120]   getting charged within a couple weeks.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.760]   I do read the New York Times, because it's no longer New York
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.400]   Times selected.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.320]   It's much more of the paper on the iPad.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.960]   And I like it.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.600]   I won't buy Mac.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.840]   Here's the funny thing is now the magazines
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.920]   are starting to become available.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   I look at Wired, and I go, oh, yeah, I'm going to buy that.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.400]   It's really.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.160]   So it's working for--
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.560]   I don't want to carry it around.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.960]   I mean, I travel a lot.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.680]   And so for me, having all those magazines--
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.560]   I have tons of magazines.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.320]   I've got my books.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.240]   I've got my audio books.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.920]   All that stuff is all on my iPad.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.360]   And I don't really want to carry anything else around.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.640]   The really interesting thing, though,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.000]   is that you get kind of broken from long-term habits.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.120]   It really doesn't even occur to me to buy a newspaper
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.560]   or to buy a magazine these days.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.920]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.840]   That's kind of--
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.720]   I haven't been broken of the habit of buying books.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.040]   But I do know that Wired magazine is available.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.400]   I do know that all these other magazines are available
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.440]   for the iPad.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.880]   But there was a curiosity factor when the first couple
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.480]   issues came up.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.880]   And I've never been tempted to download a large file
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.600]   for a kind of high amount of money
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.280]   that's going to contain a lot of content that I'm probably
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.400]   never going to get around to reading.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.560]   So--
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.600]   Interesting.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.400]   You're not eating-- the most interesting thing to me,
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.640]   not even when I fly.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.440]   Because it used to be the last bastion of magazine purchasing
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.760]   for me was when I get through airport security,
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.200]   I go to the Hudson News.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.120]   I buy a copy of People magazine.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.640]   And I have something to read for the 20 minutes
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.480]   at the start of the flight or the 20 minutes at the end
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   of the flight, because you can get through a whole people
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:32.520]   magazine.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.040]   If you really hunker down, you can get through a whole people
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.200]   magazine through airport.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.400]   It takes a manful effort.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.040]   You just got to care about learning about the world around
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.760]   you and what kind of--
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.640]   I find the economists will last me--
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.120]   economists will last me like three or four legs.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.000]   So I've got to go down.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.040]   I'm flying to San Francisco or Dallas.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.320]   You're flying to--
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.640]   Well, but I'd say I'd 12 hops and--
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.280]   I don't--
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.680]   All I care about is the first 10 minutes.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   It's the first 10 or 15 minutes and I'm back to my iPad.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.320]   I just need the-- I need paper to--
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.280]   Oh, you only use that because--
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.840]   Because I'm not allowed to turn my iPad on.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.800]   I'm not allowed to turn it on.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.240]   That's the big thing.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.000]   As soon as they let us turn my iPad on, I'm done.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.960]   It's Angry Birds.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.800]   It's Angry Birds.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.280]   It's all about the Angry Birds.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   RIM continues to push its playbook,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.760]   even though it doesn't really exist now, a video showing
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.200]   the playbook versus the iPad in terms of--
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.440]   I'm not sure what--
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   Web performance.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Web performance?
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   Web performance?
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.080]   They're showing that complex Java sites really loaded much,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.600]   much faster on the playbook than on the list up-to-date iPad,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.480]   which is a good demo.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.640]   It's exactly what people were sort of asking Adobe to do
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.480]   that if you really want to show that Flash can really work
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.600]   well on a mobile device, just release a video showing it
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.760]   working great and that you win the argument.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.560]   Oh, there you go.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.080]   Look how much faster that was.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   It's not all-- I did look at that pretty closely.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.520]   It's not all down to the fact that it's a smaller screen
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.120]   or that it's pushing fewer pixels.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.280]   That's not that at all.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.600]   It really does seem to be a fair apples-to-apples sort of test.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.760]   But they still have yet to really demonstrate it.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.520]   What they've demonstrated now is that, OK,
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.040]   so it's going to be a little bit faster
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.000]   when you're browsing the web, which
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.680]   means that if it's really important that you get something
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.560]   loaded in in six seconds instead of eight seconds,
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.240]   that's a really big deal.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.120]   But hey, what if I'm not actually using the web?
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.280]   What if I'm using apps or email or other things?
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.120]   It's much, much more than just a web browser.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.720]   But still, it's really good that these companies are coming out
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.840]   of the gate early on to sort of demonstrate
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.160]   why they're getting into the market
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.440]   and why they think that they can do something that Apple is.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.240]   And I've been following the blog of a company called Notion,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.200]   Inc. that's making what looks to be a really nice Android
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.800]   tablet called the Atom.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.720]   And they're still not going to be shipping for a little while
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.000]   yet.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.280]   But every couple of weeks, every three weeks they show,
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.920]   well, here's how we've got some of this calendar interface
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.440]   working.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.200]   Here's the weather app.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.120]   And here's how we've got that working.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.160]   Here's the new logo design.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.800]   And just by making sure they remind people
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.920]   that they're still working on this,
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.000]   they still maintain a certain amount of credibility.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:09.880]   And I thought maybe I wasn't interested in a seven-inch tablet.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.480]   But I have to say, I have to play with a Samsung Galaxy
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:12.760]   tab.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.640]   I don't think seven is as bad as Steve Jobs made it out to be.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's different.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.520]   Now, my review is going to hit the sun times.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.000]   I think sometime this week depends.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.200]   Thanks, giving me my screw things up.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.160]   It might be pushed until Monday just gets more eyeballs on it.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.440]   But yeah, the Galaxy tab is probably my fate.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.720]   No, probably definitely my favorite Android device.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.800]   And you really get your head around the fact
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.600]   that you don't think of it as a competitor to the iPad.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.240]   You think of it as its own thing.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.480]   And really in the show, I was talking about the problems I had.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.240]   No matter how hard I wanted to get the iPad working
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.400]   inside the car, it's just one of those things
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.800]   where it's too big, it's too glossy, it's just not going to fit.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.440]   Whereas a seven inch tablet, you can get that working very nicely
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.280]   in that space between the driver side window
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.360]   and your steering wheel without interfering with anything.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.280]   And you do get that sort of media rich user interface
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.320]   rich experience for navigation and in flight entertainment.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.920]   So it definitely has a place to go.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   Look at the fluidity of this animation here.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.960]   This is a H2L5 animation.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.000]   You can really see the difference.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.880]   Yeah, that's where it really hurts, considering
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.200]   that there is no greater advocate of HTML5 for using
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.080]   canvas for everything than Steve Jobs and Apple.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.400]   And oh, well, ours seems to work a lot better than yours, Steve.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.280]   Some HTML5 updates in the new Safari, by the way,
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.760]   some additional features.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.960]   They are getting closer to making it a better, you know,
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.280]   a real platform, I think.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   It's getting there.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.000]   The other cool thing is they finally added
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.200]   search within the page in iOS 4.2.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.600]   Yeah, that's the little thing.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.120]   It's like, yes, please, thank you.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:45.760]   Thank God.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.360]   Praise the holop, praise Buddha.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.640]   We had all sorts of little hacks we had that we would do
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.000]   with JavaScript and stuff to make that doable.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.160]   It's just it should have been in there.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.520]   That's--
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.120]   Do not run to TJ Maxx to buy a 390--
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.080]   It's like that double take that got from Alex.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   The TJ Maxx.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.920]   How does it-- how does it get into--
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.520]   Do not run to TJ Maxx.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.720]   They tweeted that they had iPads for $3.99.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.600]   And it turned out--
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.480]   Well, they did.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.400]   They apparently had 80 of them spread throughout their thousands
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.280]   of stores.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.480]   And as far as we can tell, they just went out and bought them.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   They're not a reseller.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.400]   It was just to get a whole bunch of people just to get--
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.120]   And you know what?
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.680]   It worked.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   You know, the technical term for that.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   It's called bait in switch.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.160]   Well, I'm sure they said something like, you know,
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.920]   wall supplies last or--
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   Oh, I need just one for that.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   Why bother with 80?
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.640]   I guess you had to show that you had a good college try.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.440]   Yeah, 80.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.800]   I know.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.280]   That's true.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.320]   You know, it's like, why does-- we got one.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.600]   I guess you can say we have some.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.840]   Apparently, not many got them.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.720]   Marshals and TJ Maxx are the same store.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.840]   An email from Steve Jobs when asked,
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   would you-- could you match--
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.040]   credit a 9 to 5 Mac-- would you-- could you
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.440]   match the price that TJ Maxx offered?
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.720]   Where are you laughing?
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.480]   I'm not entirely convinced that Apple considers TJ Maxx
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.320]   to be a competitor to Apple.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.720]   I have the Apple store.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.360]   What's the difference?
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.560]   We're not selling pants for $11.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.360]   Maybe we should start selling $11.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.200]   I've never heard an Apple employee say,
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.840]   well, match that price.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.600]   No, those words don't--
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.560]   Yeah, they're just like, you can go over there and get it.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.520]   But the last time you saw a price differential,
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.440]   more than like $8.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:29.960]   Exactly.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.680]   So this is-- we're the people who are excited about,
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.480]   how is Walmart being able to sell this phone for $8 less
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.920]   than everybody else in the entire world?
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.480]   By the way, a headline including TJ Maxx and iPad.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.960]   Just really doesn't look right.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.200]   Ooh.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.080]   Josh, writing his--
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.160]   Yeah, see that doesn't look good.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.000]   Running to sjobs@apple.com.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.480]   Hey Steve, if I walk into an Apple store
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.720]   and ask for you to match TJ Maxx's price, would you do it?
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.000]   Steve Jobs says, nope.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.800]   Then he asks, is TJ Maxx even an authorized reseller?
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   And nope.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.200]   At least we know it's Steve because his response was nope.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.480]   Do you think he has like an auto script?
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.200]   Nope.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:12.680]   And--
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.600]   No, you're thinking they're all different.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.000]   Nope.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.240]   We never see one that's like, yep.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.280]   I don't see-- we don't see very many that are--
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.480]   that are like-- it doesn't look like someone
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.320]   cutting past them out.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.600]   No, I think he's doing it.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.320]   I wonder if there's just a bunch of mini-steves.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.520]   No, I think he's doing it.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.480]   Although if you were trying--
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.320]   It'd be a PR.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.440]   --they get to be like six months in training.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.840]   If you were going to be a PR person trying to impersonate Steve,
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.760]   you'd make sure you said things like, nope.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   Yep.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   Yep.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.280]   Yep.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   Nope.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.080]   He's doing the--
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.920]   Clint Easton.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.440]   He's like a laconic ranch hand, nope.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.320]   Yeah, not gonna do it.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.280]   According to A.C. Nielsen--
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.040]   This is the stupid story of the week--
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.760]   which conducted a survey in October
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.360]   to see which tech products American kids want
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.120]   through the beginning of next year.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560]   Hmm.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.080]   Hmm.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.960]   Just-- hmm.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   What do you think?
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.440]   Hmm.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.000]   17 items on that list.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.280]   Number one, a Camaro that shoots fires.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.120]   Yeah!
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.720]   Number two, a PlayStation 8.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.960]   So they talked to kids from the ages of six to 12.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.000]   Number one, an iPad.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.040]   Actually, that is kind of maybe a surprise for the kids
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.600]   that age, an iPad.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.720]   A computer and iPod touch tying for second with 29%
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.480]   saying they wanted those.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.200]   31% said they wanted an iPad.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.960]   Nintendo DS in the fourth place.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.400]   That's got a scary Nintendo.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.640]   25% of kids.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.120]   And this is their market for the DS.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   PlayStation 3, any non-iPhone smartphone and a mobile phone
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.280]   all tied for fifth place.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.200]   The Apple iPhone, a television, and as yet unreleased,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.840]   Nintendo 3DS, rounding out the top 10, each with 20%.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.320]   An e-reader, the least popular gift of the year,
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.400]   racking 17 out of 17 choices.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   And that just scare Amazon.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:01.920]   [LAUGHS]
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.600]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.080]   You know, I buy a lot of Kindle books for my iPad.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.400]   So this was a little constraint.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.920]   I guess they gave them a list of devices
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.000]   and then said, what do you want most?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.720]   Well, I know that our babysitter, she was talking about it.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.200]   She was asking if that's the iPad and everything else.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.120]   Because I guess her nephew wants to buy one.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.440]   Or he wants one for Christmas.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.120]   And then when we told her how much it was.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.600]   [SCREAMS]
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.360]   But the-- yeah, I know my--
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.200]   the biggest thing I'm having trouble with
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.440]   is deciding how much my son's allowed to use his iPad.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.440]   Because it's really a--
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440]   He has his own?
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.240]   Well, he has my old one.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.760]   Because the 3G came out and I got--
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.840]   You need to make any excuses here.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.440]   No, I just--
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.520]   You're among friends, Alex.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.200]   It's my job.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.520]   We understand you don't need to say that here.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.760]   My older son, I just bought him one.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.200]   But anyway, I'm waiting for him to destroy it.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.160]   He hasn't destroyed it yet.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.640]   He dropped it last night and hurts.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.120]   But--
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.040]   You need-- this is the case.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.120]   No, I need to get that case.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.680]   I looked at that case and I was like, see, here it is.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.400]   I already bought--
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   I already bought the Sammio.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.200]   This is real.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.560]   It's good for a kid because it's lime green.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.320]   Can I put that one on?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.160]   We'll test it like the--
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:13.960]   like the Wookiee.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.840]   So it's got the silicone rubber.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.080]   But then it's got the--
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.600]   I like this.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.440]   They do them for-- and Sibio doesn't for iPhones, too.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.960]   Kind of like a plastic hard shell.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.720]   No, it needs it because--
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.960]   The only thing that's where the corners are--
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.880]   Here's the only thing that I'd want, though, is that I need--
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.120]   I need something to flap on the front.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.160]   It doesn't have a flap on the front.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.000]   I need to flap on the front.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.960]   No.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.840]   I'll try it, though.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.680]   I don't know if you're doing it.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.200]   Flap on the front.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.920]   Well, the thing is, is that he stands on it.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.160]   You need more than a flap if he's going to stand on it.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.040]   I looked over.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:41.540]   I looked over.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.320]   I was watching the steeler game.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.720]   I looked over and he's standing on the iPad.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.280]   I said, it's not going to work much longer
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.000]   if you keep on doing that.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Standing on it.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.200]   I wonder what that was all about.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:48.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.260]   I don't know.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:49.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.360]   He's-- no, fortunately, he wasn't stomping on it.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.440]   He was standing on it.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   I don't know what--
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.320]   it makes me just this much higher.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.440]   I think he thought it was cool.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.840]   They asked 13-year-old kids what they wanted, number one
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.040]   for 13 and up, a Mac or PC, a computer, then a television,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.120]   then a smartphone, not an iPhone, then an iPad,
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.000]   a Blu-ray player, an e-reader.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.400]   e-reader bigger with the older kids.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.760]   The Nintendo Wii ranked seventh among teens.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.200]   That's not good.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.560]   Only 15% wanted a Wii.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.080]   That's probably because they all had one already.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.160]   Then the iPhone, then the PlayStation 3 with 13%.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   The Sony PlayStation Portable least desired
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.920]   among teenagers number 17.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.800]   It well-- I didn't even know they still made that.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.200]   I think I have one around somewhere.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.320]   Now, interesting because Duracell does the same thing.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.640]   The Duracell Toy Report, according to that survey,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.080]   40% of the kids between the ages of 5 and 16 want 40%,
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.280]   almost half want an iPhone 4, iPod Touch, or iPad.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.640]   Apple is in a good position for the holidays.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.800]   It's a good gaming platform.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.040]   You guys were talking about that last night on Twitch.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.920]   It's a great gaming platform.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.040]   I think that's what I do mostly with it.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040]   I think I do.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.280]   I think actually if you look at minute for minute--
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.000]   And you know what I do mostly with the iPhone?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.800]   It's take pictures because it's got a decent camera.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.560]   I love Instagram and food spotting.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.200]   And then I use the iPad for gaming.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.720]   And then I use the MacBook Air to keep track
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.040]   of all my other devices.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.400]   Waz says, you misquoted me.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.840]   I didn't say Android was better.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.440]   I never say Android is better than the iPhone.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.280]   What are you talking about?
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.320]   He says, almost every app I have is better.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.560]   Here, let's just play a little.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.920]   Can never go wrong with the Waz.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.240]   Yes, I saw a lot of headlines all over it.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.520]   Are not something that I say.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.240]   And it happens occasionally.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.320]   But I gave the reporter maybe an hour, hour and a half.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.280]   And I spent about 20 minutes talking about my vision of--
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.200]   well, of how comfortable it is to speak commands
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.760]   to an iPhone.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.240]   And I gave it many examples.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.520]   And then I pulled out my iPhone.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.000]   I spoke into several different apps
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.200]   to show the sort of things that are really changing my life.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.960]   At the end of 20 minutes, I said, well, there's--
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.680]   the one thing I can't do that you can't do on Android phones
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.400]   is you can say navigate to Joe's Diner or something.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.920]   And then I pointed out that Apple had purchased Siri.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.240]   And they had purchased a mapping company.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.040]   So it's likely to expect the iPhone.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.280]   That's a long-- you know, pointing out one thing
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.920]   that the Android does, that interpretation I've never said.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.240]   Anything like that to anyone.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.080]   He's back.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.280]   Backpedalyn fast.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.400]   I guess it wouldn't really do for the founder of Apple
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.960]   computers, say Android's better.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.360]   You see the rumors that Apple might be acquiring nuance?
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:49.080]   Yeah, that's-- again, that's the Waz going to be misquoted
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080]   or--
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   No, is that--
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080]   Misspeaking, I think.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.760]   That was the speculation.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.720]   Now, according to a piece on Engadget,
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.840]   because I think Waz also spoke directly to Engadget as well,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.880]   he was talking about an app for the iPhone
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.280]   that he likes a lot.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.640]   Engadget seems to think that he confused nuance
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.920]   with the maker of that other iPhone app.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   With Siri.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920]   Excuse me.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.480]   Which was also acquired.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.320]   Supposedly, according to Engadget, I hadn't heard about it.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.680]   But Engadget says that that is the company that
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   haven't quite--
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.880]   I'm going to say is that would be awesome.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   $5 billion valuation.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.080]   Apple could afford him, but I don't understand why.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.080]   Man, why?
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   I'll tell you why.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.480]   No, I'll tell you why.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   I use Dragon.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.320]   So I use Dragon every day.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.000]   And I can tell you with an absolute assuredness
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.480]   that there is nobody with a voice recognition library that
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.800]   is anywhere in the ballpark of what nuanced has.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800]   I agree.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.000]   They've been doing this for 20 years.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.440]   They do it better than anyone else.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.840]   And the thing is is that when you talk about voice activation,
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.680]   if you want to own the voice activation market, you buy them.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.240]   And if Apple wanted to make all of their apps and all
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.040]   the other stuff, be real voice activation,
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:07.160]   and incorporate it into their phones and Macs and Apple TVs
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.960]   and everything else, they would buy nuance.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.520]   Yeah, nuance would make less money
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.640]   because it was not licensing to lots of people
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640]   or whatever.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.520]   I mean, it would be on the eye.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.920]   I mean, if we had nuanced technology embedded on the iPhone,
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.280]   oh my gosh.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.040]   Well, that's the only reason why they would actually do it.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.400]   If they acquired it, you could definitely
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.920]   see the 45-minute demonstration of how voice-enabled iOS 5.0 is
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.560]   on the iPhone and on the iPad, but mostly on the iPhone.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.600]   But one of the most disappointing things of the past 10 or 15
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.440]   years of Apple history is that they just
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.800]   don't seem to really care about voice control.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.840]   They care about it as an assistive technology,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.760]   and it's very well supported there.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.040]   But I've always thought that if there's
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.600]   a big opportunity for one crazy millionaire
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.360]   to do a $40 million startup, that becomes a half a billion
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.320]   dollar company.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.800]   It's going to be the first company that really does
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.120]   a voice-controlled operating system that is just absolutely
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.280]   and immediately compelling to the average user.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.200]   Well, I think it's there.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.000]   I think it can happen.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.520]   I just don't think anybody's really trying.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.040]   I think the issue, though, is that I mean,
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.880]   I desperately want a full dragon capability on my iPad,
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.240]   because that's where I don't want to type
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.080]   a big, long verbiages of information.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.520]   I want to be able to type--
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.040]   because if someone gets an email from me that's
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.280]   longer than about six lines, it means that I probably--
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.600]   it's probably very verbose and has very weird typos
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.600]   that look like whole words, because I just
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.800]   flick on my mic and I start talking.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.400]   And so I don't want it for voice activation or voice control.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.080]   I want to be able to put in right-hole articles on my iPad.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.760]   And I don't really look at being able to do that right now.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.720]   Well, I'm totally opposite there.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.400]   I mean, if you want to replace a keyboard in a mouse,
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.840]   OK, that's fine, but that's boring.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.400]   What I really want to be able to do
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.640]   is to walk past my living room and with my coat, my hat,
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.680]   my car keys, my hand, and say, computer,
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.000]   has there been anything-- any interesting emails
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.640]   since the last time I checked?
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.520]   And then being able to parse that and say, well,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.400]   that means that there is a list of people
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.120]   that he's actually interested in.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.120]   I'm going to search over the past eight minutes,
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.440]   because that was the last time he sat down with a computer
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.200]   and actively asked for a new mail.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.080]   There is one email from an editor,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.800]   so I will tell him, yes, there was an email from 10 minutes
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   ago from your editor at the Sun Times.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.680]   The subject line is this.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.600]   And things like, computer schedule breakfast tomorrow
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   with Teresa at Denzano in Coolidge Corner.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.360]   And for it to do just the simple Newton text recognition
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.880]   technology and simply say, OK, I can extract enough information
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.080]   from that one simple sentence to know how I should schedule that.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.720]   That's the sort of thing I'm looking for.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.200]   There needs to be a really new hands-off interface,
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.160]   where I don't have to do this or do--
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.120]   I mean, I know that I--
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.480]   I'm moving shots sort of moves in order to control my computer.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:56.680]   Right.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.120]   I mean, I know that for me, what I want to be able to do
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:58.680]   is work out.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.560]   Like, when I'm working out on--
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.160]   I want to be able to watch the video, like I do P&DX
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:03.560]   or whatever.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.080]   And so I want to watch the video.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.360]   And when it says, write down how many reps and at what weight,
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.080]   I just want to-- I want it to say, wait.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.800]   And I go 45.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.960]   You know, reps, 14 or whatever, and then keep on going.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.520]   And that's actually pretty easy.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.880]   But the problem is right now is there's
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:24.920]   just no way to embed that well into my iPad or iPhone stuff.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.160]   And so I think that that is--
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.640]   I think that would make a big difference.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.680]   I think that $5 billion for Apple to buy nuance
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.800]   would be a bargain.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.760]   I mean, for what they could do with it.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760]   That's the thing.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.800]   Oh, Leo, doesn't look happy.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.440]   What happened, Leo?
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.040]   I thought I ordered the Mini DisplayPort 2 S-Video adapter.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.960]   But I got the Mini DisplayPort 2 VGA adapter instead.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.800]   That's not as good.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.600]   Not what I want to do.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.960]   Damn it.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.120]   Give me a name.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.200]   Give me a name.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.280]   You'll be damn Mini DisplayPort.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.480]   They have a Mini DisplayPort to S-Video.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.760]   Oh, I need that.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.280]   I know.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.000]   That's what I needed too.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.760]   Oh, well.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.320]   I didn't even know it existed.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320]   I didn't even know it existed.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.720]   But I do have the ethernet adapter for the air.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.760]   So let me show you.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.280]   And then we're going to get our picks of the week.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.000]   This is the holiday gift of the year.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.160]   Get your credit card out.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:19.520]   Wow.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.360]   Are you ready?
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.520]   Get your credit card out.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.240]   This is from the Mac--
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.840]   or I'm sorry, Mike Gadget blog, Mikegadget.com.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.680]   I'm scared.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.520]   I'm not much of a whole--
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.280]   It's a phenomenal, phenomenal the Steve Jobs
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.240]   action figure.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.360]   First of all, take a look at the body with a little black
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.000]   turtleneck, the skinny butt blue jeans.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.320]   Just looks so much like him.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.240]   The giant Steve Jobs had the gray hair.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:46.800]   Is it a bobblehead?
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.480]   It doesn't look like this.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.160]   That's why it needs to be a bobble.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.280]   No, it doesn't bobble.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.960]   But the sculpting is incredible detail.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.440]   Look at this.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.080]   Look at the jeans.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.000]   Realistic.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.880]   And he's standing on an Apple logo.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.200]   Well, get ready.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.920]   That could be a problem.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.280]   He's holding an iPhone 4.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.000]   Not detachable.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.360]   Not usable.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.360]   But you can disassemble the hand.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360]   I don't think you'd want to.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.280]   You can't replace the battery on that one either.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.200]   And buying it before Apple realizes that Apple sees the show
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.680]   and says, hey, you're using our logo and our iPhone
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.520]   and you're fired.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.960]   Look, he can actually hold an iPhone 4.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.520]   Wow.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.160]   We need to get that for--
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:23.720]   Look at the detail on that.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.640]   We need to get that for I Justine.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.920]   Doesn't that look just like him?
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.200]   Everything beautiful, handmade.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:30.720]   Sold out.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   The glasses--
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.680]   Wow, it's sold out $80 each for--
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.200]   He made $240,000.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.120]   Hold on, hold on, slow down.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:43.400]   There's even a white erasable marker speech balloon
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.000]   that you can attach to a small hole on the backside of the head
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.240]   in the wrong business so that he can say one more thing.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.080]   Look at that.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.800]   Oh, now how much would you pay?
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.120]   Or yep.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.520]   Yep, nope.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.120]   Extra-brought.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:56.560]   Awesome.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.880]   Magical, unbelievable, cool.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.760]   We hired our users.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.920]   Every phone has weak spots.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.600]   Avoid holding it like this.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.640]   There is no antenna gate.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.160]   If you want--
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.640]   Pardon, get an Android.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.240]   One more thing.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.000]   These are just some suggestions.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.080]   OK, that's the good news.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.360]   They did, in fact, offer it for $79.99 with free shipping.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.400]   Three to four weeks, allow three to four weeks.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.960]   Due to overwhelming demand, they can only
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.560]   guarantee for the first 200 orders.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.000]   Oops, cross that out.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.880]   300 sets of phenomenal figures totally sold out.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.200]   Oops, cross that out.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.720]   During due to overwhelming demand,
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.240]   we're planning a second batch of production.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.720]   More details will be announced in mid-to-sum.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.080]   Oh, cross that out.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:41.880]   Finally, Apple has informed us that this phenomenal SG
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.640]   action figure is not consented to the use of Apple's
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.880]   copyrights and trademarks.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.280]   And therefore, they request us to immediately cease the--
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.920]   All they have to do is get rid of the logo.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.360]   I guess all they have to do is get rid of that logo
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.000]   in the bottom.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.240]   Yeah, I think the logo-- because Steve's a public figure.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.400]   I think you use him, I think.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.720]   You can use him.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.240]   You might not-- I don't know.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:16:59.960]   It's the logo.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.760]   They should just pull the logo right off.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.080]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.640]   Also, because it wasn't that--
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.440]   it wasn't one of these half-assed things.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.360]   It was just done so exceptionally well.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.880]   And you just wish that some of these--
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.680]   sometimes you just see where, oh, I was--
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.240]   good luck.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.560]   You almost had a really huge success in your hands.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.600]   But fortunately, you did all the right mistakes
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.240]   to make sure that it would not last.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240]   Now, the latter--
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.600]   It's because--
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.720]   Oh, because it's obvious to me.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]   Oh, like this?
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720]   He's the--
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.480]   Anybody would say, OK, well, they're things--
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.400]   they're ways that we absolutely cannot possibly legally
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.040]   defend this.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.760]   That would be the logo and the use of the actual iPhone.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.400]   But all we got to do is make a trivial change to the base,
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.320]   a trivial change to the thing he's holding.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.400]   And not only-- yeah, too bad.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.480]   Now, I'm angry because I want one and I can't have one now.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.520]   Oh, yeah, they look fantastic.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.440]   I would love to have that on the set.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.080]   They say that the lawyers said it's
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.840]   the unauthorized use of Steve's likeness.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.600]   California Civil Code Section 3344.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.280]   Any lawyers in the audience want to help me with this?
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.000]   I thought you could do anything you want with public figures.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.440]   And I don't think you can when it comes to selling a product.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:07.960]   I can't see it.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.080]   You can't sell a product.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.080]   I think that's--
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.760]   Oftentimes, what the action figure manufacturers will do
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.720]   is call it high-tech big wig.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.200]   Right.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.640]   And you just have to say that, no, that's not Steve.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.320]   Oh, I suppose maybe there's some sort of a likeness.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.000]   But I'm not sure if you could--
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   I'm not sure how many years would take you in court
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.240]   to prove that we have the intention of making this look
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.040]   like Steve Jobs.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.600]   But--
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.840]   Well, yeah, that one would be pretty--
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.480]   Wow.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.000]   It's really good.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.080]   It looks just like Steve.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.400]   There's no way that's a fake.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.200]   I mean, you know, that's somebody that's a named figure.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   OK, well, true.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.760]   Any judge is going to look at that.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.880]   Well, usually, well, usually what--
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.880]   I like action figures.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.040]   I don't buy them as much.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.520]   When I was in my 20s, it's just to collect them.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.360]   But then I stopped.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.320]   But I still read about them.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.840]   I'm really fascinated by how well these things are put together.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.480]   And oftentimes, what they will--
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.320]   if they want to do something like that,
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.560]   if you really want to do a JLo action figure,
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.920]   but you don't want to pay for the license,
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.920]   and you know you're just going to make about 1,000 of them,
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.720]   what you do is you simply find someone who looks a lot like JLo,
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.000]   take pictures of like a high sewer was.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.880]   Give her a-- no, pay her $500 modeling fee,
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.680]   where it's explicitly stated that we want to do an action
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.240]   figure based on your likeness.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.600]   And everybody knows that you're really
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.080]   doing a JLo action figure.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.640]   But the thing is, you have all this paperwork,
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.800]   and all this-- you've done all this diligence to prove that,
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.280]   oh, well, no.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.360]   I mean, I suppose we called her Latina Celebrity,
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.560]   but goodness gracious.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.600]   If you think that she's the only celebrity out there,
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.360]   that's a race--
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.560]   That's a celebrity doll.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.720]   Now, the width of the behind, that's a purely
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.080]   consequential.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.920]   We had to fill out the mold somehow,
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.760]   and we decided to make--
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.000]   It's next to plastic.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.480]   I just want to know who the manufacturers of the tournament--
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.880]   that's what I want to know.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880]   The infamous tournament.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.360]   I feel sad because I was--
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.840]   it was that for the holidays, or perhaps this,
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:58.320]   the Apple One computer that they sold at Christie's.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.600]   But it went on sale.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.840]   This is from the BBC guarantee.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:05.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.400]   Before I give you the final results of the Christie auction,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   yes, Andy and I go.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.000]   I was going to say, it got sold.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.840]   Maybe someone bought it for you, and maybe there's
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.480]   going to be a very--
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   Yes.

[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.320]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:17.800]   Think of that.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   It could be a gift.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.240]   Maybe each and every one of your listeners
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.200]   decided to chip in, we passed around the hat.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.760]   I think more than a dollar each.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.280]   Let's see.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.040]   I think Andy just flicked off a couple bills.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.200]   Do we know where this Apple One came from?
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.280]   I got that much on me.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:32.880]   Let's see.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.280]   How much?
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.720]   That's just walking around money for Andy.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.800]   Apple One auction at Christie's auction.

[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.880]   Apple One, a successful bidder, backhand seven.

[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.000]   Come around your Apple.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.560]   Would be delighted to watch Apple One,

[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.880]   They said Steve will autograph it.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.000]   I wonder if it's Steve's.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.200]   Look at the bids coming in.

[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.040]   You don't see these guys at Christie's that often.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:13.760]   Oh my god.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.240]   What a Cosby sweater and that guy in the second row.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]

[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.440]   And then the Apple One sold.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.040]   And it really was an important, important step.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.560]   I look back at that machine.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.120]   I didn't really feel that way even when I designed it.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.120]   But I take a look at it and say, oh my gosh, the whole formula was actually exposed and
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.320]   put out there for the world.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   Wow.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   This is the first.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.480]   We had two Wozniaks in this particular show.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   Two Wozniak clips.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.480]   So that's--
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:54.280]   So suppose the paperwork that came with it shows that originally, at least back in the
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.040]   70s, belonged to-- I can't remember.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.600]   I believe that either a computer store owner or some sort of a manufacturer who had bought
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.600]   it to sort of scope it out, which is why it came without letter from Steve Jobs.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.040]   So that's what the docket says and the paperwork that comes with.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   That's right.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.240]   One of the great things about it is that it is so exhaustively complete.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.960]   You get all the paperwork that came with it.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.320]   You get the interfaces with it.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:22.000]   You get all the manuals, the box that originally shipped in, the sign letter from Steve Jobs.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.240]   Also the Christie's listing points out that it came from the address of the garage belonging
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.040]   to I believe Steve's mom and dad.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040]   Wow.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Wow.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040]   Does it run?
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   Does it run?
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.040]   That's what I want to know.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.040]   Exactly.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.760]   So I should try to boot it up and see if you can get Apple Panning running on it.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.320]   Oh, no, no, that required a floating point basic.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.880]   But I bet you can get a breakout.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.640]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.240]   We're going to come back with our picks of the week in just a second.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.120]   Andy and I co Alex Lindsey and I are here to talk Macintosh.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.800]   Before we do that, though, I'd like to talk audible audible.com.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.880]   I'm so addicted.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.280]   I'm so addicted.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.440]   I just can't stop it.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.640]   I just bought I was saying that's on Yes on Windows weekly.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.360]   I bought $100 worth of audible books.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.960]   Now I have a yesterday.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:13.720]   I have a two book a month subscription and still I just bought a hundred bucks with
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.000]   the books last night.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   I bought them.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.480]   I couldn't I couldn't wait for the Keith Richards.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.720]   Biographer autobiography.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.080]   I had to have that.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.920]   And then I was running to the end of dark tower for the wastelands and I needed dark
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.920]   tower five.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.200]   I couldn't wait until I renew.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.520]   So I had to get that and then the new Steve Martin novel came out today and I had to get
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.000]   that and no by the time I was done.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.560]   Do you have the problem that you walk into Starbucks and they're telling your order and
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.600]   you're kind of like half listening to them because you're you got one ear in your one
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.120]   ear in and you're listening to some book and you're going, yeah, pretty.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   95.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.040]   Next to the side is no cell phones are going to say no audible because I can't stop.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.600]   I cannot stop myself.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.280]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.720]   This is how you get your first book free.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.200]   You go there, you sign up for the gold account.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.560]   That's a book a month.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.640]   You can see that's not enough for me.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.960]   I have the two book a month account, but that's not even zero credits folks.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.280]   I had to go shopping because you know, they're just just this is better than candy.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   This is better.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.520]   Look at Kenneth Branagh reading Joseph Conrad's The Art of Darkness.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520]   That's kind of cool.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520]   Wow.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520]   That would be great.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520]   They have classics.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.680]   They have business and fiction and nonfiction.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.560]   They have all sorts of incredible stuff.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.920]   Yes, that new Steve Martin just came out.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.320]   The new Metatropolis Cascadia is now out.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.800]   That's a audible exclusive.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.240]   You can't get it anywhere else.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.600]   I just I am a huge fan of audible.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.120]   Any of you listen to the Keith Richards yet?
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.280]   I have not listened to listen to Keith Richards yet.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.720]   First I need to know is Keith narrating it?
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   No.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.720]   That's what it's visited me.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720]   It's a joke.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.720]   No.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   That's string.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.720]   All of it.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.720]   That's it.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720]   That's it.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.240]   Yeah, no, I think that they decided that they would be better.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.560]   Better not to have.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.080]   It is a 12 hour long audio book.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.880]   He's never been sober that long this past.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.880]   Exactly.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.480]   He can't focus that quite long.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.200]   It's actually 15, 16 hours long.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.360]   I can't wait.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.360]   It's on my list.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.680]   It's my next listen and then I've got an object of beauty, the new Steve Martin book.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.880]   I'm going to listen to that because I'm interviewing Steve on the radio show.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.840]   You know, I said, well, we'll talk about the book.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.520]   He says, your audience doesn't care about my book.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.080]   But then he said, so he's calling you all illiterate.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   That's nice.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   You're honest.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   But he did.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.400]   We were doing a FaceTime because he's going to use FaceTime and he did say, but can you
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.600]   see the book if I hold it up?
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.880]   And I said, yes, I can see it.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   Just fine.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   Thank you.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.480]   So yeah, he's your audience though.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   He listens.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.320]   He's he has three iPads, but he, you know, one of the things he says, but I don't want
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.840]   to talk about the book I got, I got questions about Twitter and I want you to help me figure
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.640]   out how to use his droid X.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   So yeah, that'll be.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.480]   That's going to be on the radio show on Sunday, 1230 Pacific three, three, three, three, three
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.080]   is this one iPad.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.760]   Andy, you're right.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.440]   And the keyboard doc.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.920]   That's all I need.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.000]   And then do you have an audible book you've been listening to lately that you want?
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   Well, I haven't done a pick in like three weeks.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.800]   I've got like four books lined up.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.960]   The pick this week is a really good book called the war for late night by Bill Carter.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.800]   This is a he did the bill Carter to this wonderful book about 10 or 15 years ago when Letterman
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.680]   lost the Tonight Show called the late shift where he after the fact he interviewed every
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.040]   executive he interviewed everybody on both staff.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.000]   So the Leno show and Letterman show got getting all the behind the scenes, not the dirt, but
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.160]   the journalism on how it happened that NBC first decided that they wanted Leno and then
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.440]   decided that they wanted to put to push Carson out and what was going on behind the scenes
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.240]   to make all this sort of stuff happen.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.600]   And so this is sort of a sequel to that.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.360]   This is all about the all the the Michigan last year to this is the Conan store.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.320]   This is about the Conan versus Leno story.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.760]   And as usual, he really interviews everybody.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.960]   He talks to Jay Leno.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.200]   He talks to Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.760]   He talks to Conan staffers.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.920]   He talks to Letterman's people.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.360]   And so almost every detail of this is so carefully worked out.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.200]   And it's not a one sided thing either.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.600]   It's not all about Conan is the hero and here's how Leno kind of screwed him over and had
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.880]   NBC's help on screen people over.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.720]   It really does demonstrate that it's a it when a whole bunch of small but bad decisions
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.920]   snowballed together.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:48.640]   It leads to inevitable consequences of awfulness two or three or four years later.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.480]   And so this is all about how Leno felt as though he was being pushed out what NBC felt
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.240]   that they had to do in order to keep their late night franchise running.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.720]   What David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel were doing just on the sidelines just delighted
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.840]   beyond all get out to be watching this happen in the opposite time slots.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.440]   How Conan wound up going to TBS and then afterward an interesting post mortem in which
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:20.040]   it doesn't no one looks particularly between NBC Conan and Leno.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.360]   Nobody looks particularly good.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.160]   No one looks particularly bad.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.240]   It just looks like here's what's going on in television today and here's how this had
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.800]   to happen.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:32.920]   And especially interesting is the very, very end where they're just talking about what
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.720]   this all means.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.240]   And it's I love these books were that kind of get myself a little bit turned around from
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.080]   how I thought I was going to feel about something.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.440]   One of the people who really comes out looking great is Lauren Michaels because he's sort
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.120]   of a voice of reason or at least the way that Bill Carter has been interviewing him and the
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.840]   way that he was offering perspective on things.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.120]   And he offered he told he told Carter a story from the time when he decided to quit being
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.320]   the producer of a Saturday Night Live.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.800]   And he tells the story about how well went to the office of like the big boss in NBC.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.760]   And he said very sweetly but very definitively, Lauren let me tell you what's going to happen.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.800]   If you leave the show is going to get a little bit worse next season, then a little bit worse
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   than season after that.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.920]   And you're going to start the show is going to start losing viewers because the people
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.040]   who are your fans or your style of comedy going to notice the difference.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.040]   But we're really not going to care.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.960]   And after five years enough people are going to quit watching the show that we're going
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.080]   to cancel it.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.200]   And the show is not going to be here, but we will.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.960]   And here's the reason why all that we care about is that a show is produced called Saturday
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.200]   Night Live that it arrears.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:39.240]   It's the proper length that it gets advertisers and it comes to air at 1130 p.m.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.120]   The fact that you're neurotic about putting on a good show, we're willing to take advantage
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.440]   of that but we really don't care about that.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.840]   And that really comes down to the heart of all of these decisions and how everything
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840]   happened.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.720]   Why Leno decided to go along with being fired, why he decided to get the show back when he
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.320]   had the opportunity, why NBC offered the contract to Conan and why it took it back when it
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:04.760]   realized that they were in this terrible circumstance where they could, I won't tell the whole
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.560]   story, but one of the most incredible, the one missing piece of the puzzle that really
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:13.480]   clarified the entire situation for me was the knowledge that Conan's lawyers, when they
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:18.640]   negotiated his Tonight Show contract, did not get that one thing that every late night
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:24.760]   host, including Letterman has in their contract, specificity that their show airs immediately
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.600]   after the 11 o'clock news.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:32.040]   Conan's contract did not have that, which meant that when NBC was forced, was faced
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:36.560]   with the idea of we have to pay Leno, not only do we have to pay Leno $80 million if
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.360]   we yank him, we are contractually obligated to keep him on the air for two years.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:47.640]   Whereas with Conan, we can bump him to 12 to 1205 without breaking his contract.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.480]   If he decides to quit, we just have to pay him off $40 million and that's just the way
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.280]   that's going to have to turn out.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.840]   Anyway, it's really, really, it was really a great read from start to finish.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.880]   It was also cool because I started, actually read this, I sampled the audiobook, but I
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.920]   read it from cover to cover on my iPad.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.600]   But it was funny because the book actually was released while I was in LA and the hotel
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:16.280]   I was staying at was literally the next building over from the World Headquarters of NBC Universal.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:21.120]   So every morning when I would leave the hotel to go get the Metro to go to downtown LA,
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.360]   it was fun to look up and say, "Yep, there was an idiot in that office and an idiot in
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.760]   that office and a megalomaniac in that office up there."
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.200]   I think that what we're seeing here is the new version of Cliff Notes.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.720]   I think that Andy ought to have a new version where it's the Andy version.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.720]   I would like to listen to the Andy versions of all of these books.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.680]   At least have an Andy Kelly Terry.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.680]   Like an Andy summary.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:46.440]   Andy, I mean, I'm just telling you, if you did like a half hour summary of the whole
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.000]   book, you know, of Mison Men, of Mison Men.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.520]   Just tell us the story in Andy version.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.640]   The thing is that you'd have a following of high school students that are a million.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.120]   Because it's much more interesting.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.200]   And they're like farmers, and ones like Big and Dumb.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.960]   I guess the small ones kind of dumb too, but not as dumb as the other ones.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.000]   Anyway, so they go to this farm and the dumb one, not the big one, I'm sorry, not the
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   small one.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.360]   I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that the dumb ones, like they came to the farm first.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   Yeah, that would be good.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.840]   I blame you for this.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.600]   You would have saved me an enormous amount of pain in high school.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.480]   Because they're going to just listen to the Andy because the thing is that Andy pulls
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   out all the most, he pulls out important parts.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.120]   That's the part that I'm going to get tested on.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.120]   Who needs Cliff?
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.120]   We've got to knock notes.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120]   And knock notes.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.520]   It would not work well because they'd be like, okay, the Andy and not go notes on Ethan
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   from.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.960]   It's a piece of crap.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.440]   It's a total piece of crap.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.360]   Just take the D and move on.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.400]   Just don't get on the sled.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.360]   I can't even believe.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   Don't get on the sled.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.360]   Audible that I got.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   That's a total.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.360]   It plays on the iPhone.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.800]   The X-ray to call you out.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.800]   Anything you got it plays on.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800]   The X-ray to call you out.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800]   I'm going to get on the list.

[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:34.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   I'm going to get on the list.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   It's not a set of modifications to your Mac.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.800]   What it is, it's just a standard application.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:49.800]   You run on any app that's on your network that has access to a printer.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:56.800]   It simply acts as a virtual printer and hosts a number of virtual printers on your network
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   that any other machine on the network can then access and print to.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.800]   Including a print to Mac, which I really like.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800]   Exactly.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   That's a couple of extra features.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.800]   The big deal is that it will also work with the AirPrint.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:15.800]   On a basic level, you can do things like access to your existing three or four year old laser
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.800]   printer that's just on the network.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   You download this $10 application.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800]   Just launch it and about three miles clicks.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.800]   You've got it working with any iPhone or iPad that's on your network.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:29.800]   But the really cool thing is that it can make these fake printers that do interesting things.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:34.800]   One of them is that you can do, it'll have a feature where instead of printing, actually printing the document,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:41.800]   it will just simply turn the print job into a JPEG or PDF and just simply put it on your Mac.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   That gives you a print to PDF function that's directly from your iPad or from your iPhone.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.800]   Already that's pretty cool.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.800]   But the second another feature it has, another one of these fake printers is print to Dropbox.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.800]   It's just a simple trick where it's the no different from the print to PDF function.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.800]   But what it does is it will then copy that PDF file directly into your Dropbox.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   So it makes it really, really easy to essentially keep permanent copies of anything that you've got
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.800]   or anything that you're browsing or anything that you're reading on your iPad.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   And just simply a way to simply divert that into a PDF file that you can then simply download from Dropbox.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:25.800]   So if someone has sent you an email confirmation of directions on how to get to the conference center,
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   there are ways that you can sort of keep it on them, keep it from being deleted from your iPad.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.800]   If you really want to be safe about it and really want to get the full meat of that email,
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:45.800]   you can just tap the icon in the mail app, select print to Dropbox as a feature,
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.800]   and there will just simply be copied into the Dropbox, we've then downloaded directly.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   Now the limitation is that this only works with local network printers
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   and only with Macs that are actually running the software on it.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   So it's not as though you can be in your hotel, print an email to a PDF and then download it.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   So it will only work inside your office or inside your house.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.800]   But already you get to work from an air print feature that right now is just for people who happen to have the right kind of printer
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.800]   and now it turns into an actually useful feature.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   It's not 100% of where it should be, but 10 bucks is a small amount of money to pay to actually get the printing feature working
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.800]   without having to buy a hundred to five hundred dollars new printer.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.800]   Yeah, it's 10 bucks for this. You can try it for a week.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   10 bucks, exactly, seven day free demo. I downloaded it yesterday and it really is three miles clicks and it's done.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:40.800]   I was anticipating that we would be doing some modifications to my system library.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   My library to get this working, but nope, it's just an application.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   If you quit the application, the features stops working and stops serving that feature as the rest of the network.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   So it couldn't be easier.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.800]   I've been using it. I love the print to PDF. I think that's so great.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   That's awesome. Yeah.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.800]   Printopia actually was going to be my pick too.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.800]   Now he's scrambling. No, I'm not scrambling.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.800]   He's good.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.800]   He's good with audibles.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   We're done. How about that? There's the audible.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.800]   We're done. Andy and I both picked that one.
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:17.800]   Actually, you know, I was interested. I don't know if you tried it. The hacktivator, which is free,
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:23.800]   which basically gives you those three files that Apple left out.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.800]   Yeah, I'm not sure if that is long for this world.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.800]   It makes me a little nervous, obviously.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.800]   Well, because it's not as though it's just a standard Unix configuration file, which anybody can simply cut and paste in.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.800]   Supposedly it is copyrighted stuff from Apple.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.800]   And so I haven't looked inside those files myself, but I'm told by somebody that,
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.800]   "Yeah, that's not going to grab that while you can. That's not going to last long."
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   Well, in that case, let me download that right now.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.800]   And this is at net.com.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.800]   Just to like, sapped the bandwidth of that server and maybe prevent somebody else from downloading that.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800]   That's exactly right.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.800]   It's committing an awful crime of copyright.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.800]   It's based on the Trout and Smith hack. I just like the name of the Trout and Smith hack.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.800]   And you do this to your Mac.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:18.800]   And then this was, is this not though what the AirPrint was supposed to be, but they took it out?
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:25.800]   Yeah, it was up until, I think, up until like last month, I think it was part of the developer build.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.800]   I don't know why they took it out, but they took it out.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.800]   You'll find out.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   Exactly.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]   Just install it and find out.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.800]   Keep writing it, then you'll find out that, "Oh, that's interesting. My mouse only goes left and right."
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   Ooh, there is a reason.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.800]   Still a small price to pay.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   Andy Ennico writes for the Chicago Sun times. He also lives on the planet Hoth.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.800]   But you can reach him via the internet at www.cwob.com.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.800]   Pay no attention to the rebel in the picture.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.800]   You know what they say?
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.800]   23 hours of boredom, 18 minutes worth of fur-pure mortal terror.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.800]   That's the story of Hoth.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.800]   Alex Lindsey is the guy at the Pixel Core.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.800]   Now they're going to do maybe a live stream at Pixel Core.com/i-stream.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   We're going to try.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   Yeah, and so if you go, yeah, and definitely you can check out our website.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   Also follow Pixel Core.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   It's a CRPS at the end.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   Pixel Core on Twitter or me on Twitter or both.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   And we'll post it when we're on live.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.800]   And we're going to try to shoot from Kelly Haren's all-in-one truck, his camera truck.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.800]   We're going to be dragging a convertible behind it and running a jib around it
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.800]   and shooting some plates.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.800]   And because it's our own project, we can shoot behind the scenes and stream it.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   So we're going to try to hook up to a little hv40 so that you get a couple extra angles
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.800]   and the camera angle.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   And we're going to try to mix it through this little mixer and then pump it on a live view and out.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.800]   So it's all experiment.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.800]   We don't know if it's going to work yet, but we'll post it if it does.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.800]   Always pushing the envelope.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   And that's what we love about the Pixel Core.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.800]   Find out more at Pixel Core.com.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:04.800]   Follow @PixelCore or @AlexLindsay for the announcement.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800]   Yes.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.800]   We want to remind you, if you want to pick a best of for our holiday special,
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.800]   you can go to twit.tv/bestof.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.800]   And anything that we did in the last year, I'm sure you can come up with some funny moments.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.800]   You can't think of any best of some.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   That's why we don't.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.800]   That's why we ask our audience to do it because I can never remember any of that.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800]   That's one long mush.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.800]   I thought we did a really lovely tribute when Princess Di passed away so unexpectedly.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:29.800]   It was heartfelt.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.800]   It expressed the mood of the people.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.800]   And I think it started the healing process going.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.800]   I think if we remembered for one show, it would be that one.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]   I couldn't agree more.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.800]   Of course, now I'm going to get a lot of votes for that.
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.800]   [laughter]
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   And I do believe we lost that tape.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.800]   Awesome.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.800]   That means we're going to have to do it now.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.800]   The Princess Di tribute.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.800]   Next on Mac Brake Weekly.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   We do Mac Brake Weekly.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.800]   You're going to candle it the window, my God.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   Oh my God.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.800]   You're wearing Glens Rose.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   Don't deny it.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.800]   You're so hum.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:00.800]   [laughter]
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.800]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   You're trying to end the show and I'm trying to--
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.800]   No, I'm not.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   I don't want to ever end the show.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.800]   As evidenced by its extraordinary length the last few weeks.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.800]   If you want to watch us do this live, it is a bit of a marathon.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   Shake a bathroom break before though.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800]   Bring it back to the safety dance.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.800]   Just go to Audible--I mean, sorry--live.tv.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   And we do this thing 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1900 UTC at Live.tv every Tuesday.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.800]   I'm Leo LaPouin.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.800]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.800]   Now give back to work.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:33.800]   Break time's over.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   All right, I'm going to let you go, Mr. Hoth.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   Yep.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.800]   You're on to the fourth show of the day, I'm sure.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.800]   Yeah, enjoy your tawn-tawn.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.800]   Well, that's what you have for Thanksgiving, isn't it?
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   [laughter]
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   Well, you know, I know that what happens on Hoth stays on Hoth, but do things you don't do on--
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.800]   Tawn-tawn on trails for Thanksgiving this year.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:44:03.800]   [music]
