[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.480]   >> Sometimes an OS update is just an OS update.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.200]   >> Are you doing it now?
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440]   >> I just finished it right now.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.280]   >> Good man, we'll talk about that.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.520]   >> We'll talk about that later, but yeah, that's not a, I don't know,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   let me just finish this project.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.640]   I'm getting a new computer in a couple of weeks, but I didn't know that's a.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   >> No, a little more important than that.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.400]   Also here Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com and Mobile Nations.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.880]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.840]   I was gonna do the update with it and I saw it required a restart, so I became lazy.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.720]   >> I am going to take chances and surf the net without it, but
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120]   we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.640]   But last chance everybody, go see his tweets as he's composing them.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.560]   >> As I'm writing them, here's my credit card number, where's yours?
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.440]   >> Also here Mr. Alex Lindsey back from Washington DC.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.920]   Shot was actually better in Washington than it is.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   >> I know it is.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.760]   >> It's an internet stage.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.000]   >> Yeah, that green screen is so crappy behind you.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.960]   Oh, it's real.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.440]   And Alex has my Mac Pro.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.760]   I finally remember to bring it in just for you.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.280]   And you can, maybe you could figure out what Apple couldn't.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.760]   There's something weird about it.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.960]   Oh, and I have to give you the administrator login.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.880]   >> Okay.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   >> Yeah, so let me do that.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.960]   You could use a guest account, but that wouldn't give you the full flavor.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.760]   >> No, no, I think it'll be the Mac Pro experience.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880]   >> Alex, are you testing it for Pixel Core?
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   Is that what you're doing?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.480]   >> Yeah, we want to see how some of the 3D applications run, how it renders.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   We also want, we've got some pretty heavy Final Cut 10 projects.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.720]   We want to throw on it and see how it responds.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.360]   >> You have until the C comes out with a little big drive and
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.440]   then it's all over, I want it back.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   >> That may be years, so you're in luck.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.720]   >> Excellent, excellent.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.520]   So go to fail, I just went to gotofail.com and it says your browser is vulnerable.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   Patch as soon as possible.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   It was kind of busy, which makes me think a lot of other people are going there in
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.800]   Safari after the update.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.600]   We've talked, we actually, there, you're safe.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.160]   Who's that, Chad?
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.200]   Are you in safe?
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   >> Yep, I'm safe.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   >> Are you in safe?
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   >> No, this is Safari, if I had a- >> You updated.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.560]   >> I had a scape, yep, I updated it right before the show started.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.880]   >> So yeah.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.040]   So this all happened since we met last.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   It was kind of a dumb bug.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.400]   I wonder even if it was a bug, it has a feeling of something that might have been
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.960]   done intentionally.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.280]   If you look at the Apple source code, and for some reason the source code of this is
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.520]   published, you can see, we could, let's do a little, we could do a little test of your
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.240]   programming skill.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   Let me see if I can find that source code and I'll show it to you.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.320]   And then you can look at that source code and see what you think.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.440]   It's, I guess, why was it open source source code?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.720]   That's what I'm curious about.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.320]   Here is the link from A, V, Ender, and Dersun.com.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.800]   Look carefully, careful, this is Adam Langley's.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.280]   >> You don't have to look too careful.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.800]   >> Look carefully, look carefully at this source code.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Can you see the error?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.360]   Can you see where, so it's a typical, you know, if then kind of a thing, if there's
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   an error, then go to fail if there's an error, go, and this is the code that checks to see
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   if a certificate is authentic.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   >> Right.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   >> Unfortunately, you see in that second if then statement, go to fail, and then go to
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   fail.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.120]   This line, this line 13 never gets executed because no matter what happens, that second
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.760]   go to fail kicks in and you go to fail.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.360]   What the, the op shot of this is, according to Adam Langley and everybody else is, the
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.640]   certificate checking mechanism in SSL on Apple devices does not work.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.320]   >> And does it look like it's been there for a while?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.240]   Since 10.7, was it?
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   >> Right.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.200]   >> It's been a while for a while, not forever, but for a while.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   So it was fixed pretty quickly on iOS, 7.0.6.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   And I take it, having just arrived, it has been fixed now on OS 10.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   >> Yes.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   >> Sometimes later.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.440]   >> It just posted about an hour or two ago.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.120]   But the weird thing is, so of course, as soon as I got alerted to it, I downloaded it
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   immediately.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.720]   But if you go to the, you know, the about box, where, excuse me, the system updates box,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.400]   where, you know, we get these system updates all the time, there's always a dense bullet
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.000]   list of here's the reasons, here's why this had to be pushed out.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.680]   And guess what, there are like 14 different reasons, including, well, there's an auto
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.160]   fill problem with Safari.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.520]   And oh, you can also, as a new feature to FaceTime that allows text messaging.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.720]   And nowhere on that list is, by the way, your entire computer is vulnerable to an attack.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.640]   And you really, this is not something you should wait a day to install.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.520]   You should install it absolutely right fricking now.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   That is weird.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   >> Pretty, pretty stunning mistake.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   Now I guess, I've written a little code in my time.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.640]   I guess it would be easy to do a command V twice accidentally.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.400]   >> Yes.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.280]   >> If you were writing the code from scratch, this code's been around for some time.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.320]   >> Or a bad merge or something.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   >> Maybe a bad merge.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.520]   Or if you were a guy you had a few minutes to get into that source code repository and
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   modify a file and you wanted to disable SSL checking, it'd be a pretty quick and easy
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.160]   way to do it, wouldn't it?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   Pretty obvious too, though.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.760]   Especially since it's open source code.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.160]   >> It is, although inside of an enormous amount of code, it's had a big pile of code.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.360]   It's actually a- >> It did go undiscovered for a long time.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.080]   >> Right, and it would be more innocuous.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200]   I personally think it's probably a mistake.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.440]   But if you were a conspiracy theorist, this would be one of the more innocuous ways to
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.440]   do it.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.920]   It would definitely look like an accident if someone found it.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   >> Right.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.040]   >> Rather than writing a bunch of complex code that did something, rather than 26 lines
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.400]   of code that tie a bunch of stuff up, that obviously look like something, this looks very
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   much like a mistaken.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   >> There's no evidence that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   >> No evidence.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   It's probably not.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> If you wanted to intercept secure SSL traffic, this allows a man in the middle attack
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.600]   where you could easily spoof a secure link and get anything that's going.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.200]   In fact, there was a proof of concept code on OS X released earlier.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.360]   I think it's one of the reasons Apple quickly put this out.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.440]   Released earlier that showed somebody capturing basically keystroke logging everything on an
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   SSL.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.520]   You can see everything in the clear because basically you're the endpoint and then you
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.760]   pass along to the real endpoint transparently.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.840]   So I don't know, Andy, you're the voice of reason.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.560]   It's not on purpose, is it?
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.280]   >> No, I'd be shocked if that happened.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.640]   A, I don't think Apple's a company that would do that.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.840]   I think that, I'm saying that if Apple were forced to, motivated to put in something like
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.400]   this that allowed backdoor access to secure transactions on iOS and macOS, I don't think
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   they would do it like a fake mistake inside the-
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.080]   >> That's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.360]   >> A, I think that they would fight like hell so that they would never have to do it.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.920]   And find a way to subvert their legal requirement to do that so that there would be a way for
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.720]   a sharp-minded people like, well not me, but certainly Renee.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.360]   >> Such as releasing it to a open source code repository where others might see such an
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   obvious mistake?
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.920]   >> That's the grassy null stuff.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   >> All right, you're right.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   All right.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   >> I just don't buy it.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.960]   Also, I think it's, if this were a mistake that Apple would, I would like to think that
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.760]   they would have enough wisdom to realize that once the secret is out, they got to jump on
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   it.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.120]   They can't just do that what unfortunately is something that they do a lot, which is to,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.640]   this is bad news, let's dump this out on a Friday afternoon when we don't think many
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.600]   people are listening or when we're certainly not gonna get the mainstream news coverage
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.920]   that we might get otherwise.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.200]   I'm actually a little bit surprised that there has not been an open letter posted to Apple.com
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.400]   about this yet because this is such an important thing that you can't undo this mistake.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.280]   You can't undo this vulnerability that they've introduced to tens of millions of devices.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.880]   All you can do is demonstrate that when this thing is discovered, they get right on it
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   and they tell people about this problem.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.600]   >> Yeah, and they did on iOS.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.960]   I'm a little disappointed at how long they took with OS Tenants.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.640]   It's clear that they wanted to wait until they released a bigger 10.9.2 update because
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.200]   there's a lot of other stuff in here.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   It's a 460-day-of-life update.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.440]   >> Including a couple features, right?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.200]   So, Kali Apple, why, I mean, this is pretty serious.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.280]   I mean, nobody here is gonna deny the seriousness of this, right?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   >> No.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   >> No, thank you.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.080]   >> It seems to me that a zero day like this, you really ought to get right on it and not
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.280]   wait till the rest of this stuff is ready.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.680]   >> I mean, part of it is this philosophy that we, even if we spend, you know, $30,000 on
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.000]   a car, we are kind of okay with the idea that this is a complex piece of machinery that
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.880]   a lot of people had to develop that took many, many years.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.440]   And it's possible that there's going to be a problem with this, this is going to need
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   to be corrected.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.920]   It's possible that that problem originated at the factory is probably, it's possible that
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.240]   problem originated at the engineering table.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   We don't want that to happen, but we accept that this is part of the problems of engineering
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.920]   something that's complicated.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.240]   When you have a tech company that decides that no, we want to maintain this idea that
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.920]   our products are perfect and they are sacrosanct.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.640]   You need never, ever worry that a product that we have shipped has a problem with it.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.080]   I don't understand why there's not that level of trust with the consumer base.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.320]   I don't know if people would actually, you know, go all Ukrainian president on these
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.080]   people if this kind of a problem were addressed directly.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.200]   >> A lot of people are saying, and I think in the chat, I'm saying this, that boy, you
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   would think this would be caught in testing.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.880]   >> Is that really the problem?
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.320]   Not that this happened, but that it wasn't caught sooner.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   >> It's not clear.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.720]   You basically have to, as far as I understand from people who are talking about it, you'd
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.240]   have to basically create a second stack that you then ran tests against the two of them.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.800]   I think someone at Google said that they're going to do exactly that the next week.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.000]   >> On their stuff.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   >> On Chrome.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.040]   >> Absolutely because, you know, it's one of those things that once it happens, the value
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.240]   of doing that is absolutely clear, but it's probably not one of those things where you
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.000]   say, oh, there might be a lot, you know, maybe someone didn't follow proper formatting and
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.920]   do the right curly bracket to prevent this kind of error from happening.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.440]   We'll build a second whole version to compare it against.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.200]   That's one of those things that in hindsight, you know, it's much more obvious than it is
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.000]   in the beginning.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.440]   >> The proof of concept that captured basically all traffic came from a New Zealand security
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   consultant, I think, is Bromium, of the company, and, or Aldo Cortese.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.680]   He's actually, he's no cube, no cube discovered this one.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.160]   And yeah, he had modified his MIT M proxy code to take advantage of the open hole in
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.400]   OS 10 Mavericks.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:48.200]   It was able to intercept all secure traffic on both iOS prior to 7.0.6 and OS 10 Mavericks
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.760]   prior to 10.9.2, which just came out.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.000]   Usernames, passwords, even Apple updates.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   And that's one of the issues and maybe what slowed this down is that this could compromise
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.560]   the Apple update process itself.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.840]   And some have said that means if somebody's been compromised, the update can't be trusted.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.560]   So what I just did down low the update and now restart my computer could be installing
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.960]   actually what looks like code from Apple.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.400]   Certificate says it's code from Apple, except it's not.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.320]   So added Apple fixed that part.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.840]   I mean, seems like they maybe should have not used their standard update process.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.040]   >> I think the thing that makes us trust that this is the actual update is that if I wanted
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.160]   to trick everybody into downloading malicious update, I would say, oh my God, this is a
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   huge security breach.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   Download this right now.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.160]   >> And that's not what we're seeing.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.200]   >> So thank you for a very, very badly worded note.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.400]   >> I'm not going to complain because they say they fixed mail.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.840]   >> I haven't waited for that one anyway.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   >> In theory.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   >> In theory, we'll see.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.160]   You know, it's so funny because some of my Macs, I get my Gmail and it's updated.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.200]   In this Mac, I haven't had a Gmail update in weeks.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   >> It's fixed.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   >> It's more fixed.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   >> It's fixed.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.400]   >> And FaceTime Audio.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.960]   >> Yes.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.920]   >> So it's, it just bugs me a little bit.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.400]   It feels like Apple should have last week said, okay, we got this one line fixed, we're
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.040]   going to get this to you right away.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.520]   And maybe not do it with the standard update process because that's been compromised.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.600]   But say everybody needs to go to this website and download this or use Chrome.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.640]   You know, don't use Safari, whatever you do.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.640]   Or I don't know what.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.280]   >> So it's interesting because the decision tree is hard.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.240]   You have one line of code, but it's never one line of code.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   There's so many dependencies.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.840]   >> I think this one line of code, no, no, no.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.320]   >> You could take that line 13.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.840]   I don't think that's a problem.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.400]   >> It's a battleship and they have to turn that and that's fair enough.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.040]   But then you make the decision whether you release just an update for the security exploit
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.760]   or your weight because 10.9.2 was imminent and was ready to go.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.960]   But then the second decision becomes do you release it immediately or do you take the
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.640]   time to go through the usual process that vets and checks the update to make sure that
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.840]   there's no additional things being introduced into it that are bad.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.680]   And that becomes a PR versus tech decision because the faster you release it, the better
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.480]   it is for your public relations.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.840]   But if there's another area, you're looking incredibly stupid.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   >> That is bad, right?
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.080]   Or you wait a couple of days, you do the vetting process and then the tech people are happy.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   But PR is getting hammered the entire way.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   >> I've got to point out.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.480]   They did do it instantly on iOS.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.560]   >> iOS is a different beast.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.400]   >> I don't know that, but I mean, same issues.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.320]   You think easier to test than on iOS?
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.680]   >> Well, it's a much more controlled, much more secure environment.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.440]   I think it's harder in some ways because they have far more bill targets than they do for
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.080]   Mac.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.560]   But the ability to turn around iOS updates because there wasn't one coming, this was an
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   update just specifically to fix that.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.280]   It wasn't like 7.1 was about to be released.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.360]   7.1 was supposed to be coming out the same week or a few days later than maybe they would
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   have made the same decision there.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.720]   >> But isn't 7.1 like doing a couple of weeks?
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.920]   >> A couple of weeks and not accepting.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.280]   I mean, a couple of days to fold it into your regular update, but a couple of weeks I think
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   would be untenable.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.960]   Also, to be fair, it sounds like all you got to do is delete that obviously redundant
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.480]   line and recompile and then redistribute.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.400]   But they probably had to go through a long process to figure out what else inside Mac,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.000]   inside Mavericks was working only because this check was always failing.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.200]   And so that's probably the reason why they couldn't just simply delete and go, "I'm
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   not going to do that."
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   >> I'm not going to do that.

[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   We have a couple of people who might go and depending on how the other events turn out.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   There's an HTC event and there's GDC.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   >> The problem with South by is it's great.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   It's wonderful.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   It's so much fun.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   Austin's great.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   Music.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   Parties are great.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   There's no content.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   But it's the best party you've ever been to.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   So it's very hard for an editorial group like ours or yours to say, oh, yeah, we're going to
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   cover.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   There's no coverage.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   You go there to have a party.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   Unless somebody slips on a margarita or something.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   >> They have some pretty good panels, but you can't go in there and really cover them.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   It's not like a --
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   >> No, in fact, the speakers at South by this year are really good.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   >> You can get drunken beta previews of upcoming software, but you can't report on those either.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   >> Right.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   You going, Annie?
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   >> No, I've never been to South by.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   It's on that list of if I get invited to speak, then I would go.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   But it's as you say, it's a great place to -- I think that I guess the best way to put it
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.000]   is that there's usually a radius of travel where that would be -- for me, that would be
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.440]   a great 800-mile to 1,000-mile thing to go to.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.880]   But I'm way outside that radius of the difficulty and the expense of getting there versus what
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.560]   I would actually get out of it professionally would be really difficult.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.440]   But it's on that bucket list of, oh, sometimes I should just, as a vacation, go and do this
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.440]   thing.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.440]   >> It's really fun.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   It's actually a live view.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.560]   >> I really like to get there before it gets completely ruined because people I know who
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.160]   have been going there year after year after year were telling me about the sun dancing
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.800]   effect of South by Southwest where it used to be really for people who are focused on
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.560]   this area believed in the thing.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.320]   And now that's so much of it is now deal making and I want this part of the marketing
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.000]   promotion for this project and I'm hoping to get angel funding for this project I'm doing.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.200]   So I mean, it's -- I can usually tell about the progress and something like that by the
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   amount of press releases and like inquiries I get before a show because now I'm getting
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.000]   like a weeks before I start getting, hey, are you going to South by because I want to
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.120]   -- I love you to meet this guy and I love you to -- I can get you into this panel on
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   this thing and it's like, okay, I'm sorry, I'm not going, but definitely keep me in the
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.560]   loop.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.680]   >> It's good not to go because then you won't miss it when you don't get to go.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:12.380]   You won't have the FOMO because I have FOMO, especially now that I know the iTunes festival
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.180]   for the first time ever is going to be there March 11th to the 15th, it's at the Moody
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180]   Theater.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.220]   I don't know that theater in Austin, but listen to who's going to be there.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.580]   Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Pitbull and Zed.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.820]   I have no idea who any of those are except for Coldplay.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.420]   I've heard of Pitbull.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   It's a person, right?
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.540]   >> You haven't heard of Imagine Dragons and --
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.540]   >> And Zed?
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.580]   >> Well, Zed, I'm not familiar with, but I knew all of them but Zed.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.100]   >> A good cultural litmus test.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.260]   How many of those four do you recognize?
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.140]   And I bet you I could name your age within five years of your actual age by the number
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.140]   you recognize.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.420]   >> That'd be a good little test.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.420]   >> Test, yeah.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.420]   >> Online app.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   You know what?
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   That'd be a fun app.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.060]   Guess your age and weight app.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:05.660]   >> Just like that quiz that you're 42 years old and 220 pounds.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.620]   >> I'm going to write that.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.620]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.620]   >> And it doesn't have to be accurate.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.060]   >> And at the end it goes, is it a profit deal?
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.540]   Sorry, Andy, go ahead.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.940]   >> I was just saying, just like that web app recently said, you want to have a carbonated
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.300]   beverage that is flavored and sweetened.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.300]   What do you call that?
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.300]   Is it a soda?
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   Is it an off?
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   Is it a Coke?
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.620]   And then after I see 20 questions, you come from not only Massachusetts, but here is the
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.340]   region of Boston that you come from if this is all the language that you have.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.340]   >> That was in New York Times.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.540]   I think it was really fun based on language.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.260]   >> And I'm sure I'm sure you do the same thing with like cultural music references like
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.900]   that.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.540]   We were talking about Kenny Rogers of all things.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.260]   >> You got the other night and one of the guys in the one of the guys that works for
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.180]   me was like, yeah, I wasn't born.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.100]   >> No, I've heard of the fried chicken.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.420]   You mean the fried chicken guy?
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.220]   >> No, no, I was talking about this was the same guy.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.500]   He has a fried chicken franchise.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   See, there's another test.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   >> Kenny Rogers.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.260]   >> I'm telling you, I'm telling you, if you've heard of Kenny Rogers fried chicken and
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.020]   you've heard of Kenny Rogers the gambler, you're 48 years old and 300 pounds.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   Thank you very much.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   Good night.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.020]   I'm telling you, it's a great.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.980]   >> When are we going to get Kenny Rogers back on the, he was on the screen savers.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.900]   >> I mocked, that's my example of when the screen savers jumped the shark is when our
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.220]   Hollywood based producer who came in.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.900]   First thing he says is, well, my buddy tells me we should have more cleavage, but I'm going
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.700]   to go smart.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.620]   And then he starts booking celebrities and I'm sitting there asking Kenny Rogers what's
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.940]   on his iPod thinking how do I get out of this job now?
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.660]   >> I remember he called in, didn't he call in for like Photoshop tips?
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.220]   I think I gave Kenny Rogers a Photoshop.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.220]   >> Did you?
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   >> Yeah, one of the corporate helps.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.220]   >> Really?
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   >> Yeah, it was on.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.220]   >> Ah, Kenny Rogers.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.220]   >> He had some questions.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.340]   >> I've been altering pictures of me and my ex and I want to know.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.420]   >> No, went to save them.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.660]   >> That was the most surreal, by the way.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.540]   That was like, really Kenny Rogers Photoshop tips?
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.700]   >> Yeah, no, no, it was, that actually is a good idea.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.140]   >> Yeah, no, no, he had asked for us.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.660]   No, I gave the Photoshop tips.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.860]   >> Yeah, it was on the show you were hosting.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.860]   >> Kenny Rogers asked you for a Photoshop tip.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.100]   >> Yes, you for a Photoshop tip and I got pulled in.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   >> And then I said, well, I don't know Kenny.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.660]   I was supposed to ask you guys your eyes why, but let's get out of the show.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.380]   I was like, that's not really going to be Kenny Rogers, is it?
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.500]   And they were like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.500]   >> I'm going to be kidding.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   >> I'm going to be kidding.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   >> I just logged in.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.500]   Is this show over?
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   >> I'm not going to talk about Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.340]   >> No, we just got distracted.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.340]   The iTunes Festival.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.100]   >> Do you want to hear who Zedd is?
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.100]   >> I think they should be Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.100]   >> I think they should be Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   >> I think they should be Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.100]   >> I think they should be Kenny Rogers.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.100]   >> Zedd does this.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.100]   >> Yes, sir.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.100]   >> ♪ Still fighting ♪
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   >> You haven't heard this song?
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.100]   This is a top 40.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.100]   >> This is a top 40.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   >> Pretty generic.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.100]   >> Pretty generic.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   >> Clarity.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.100]   >> Okay, so that's Zedd.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.100]   >> And now we'll definitely get pulled off of you two.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.100]   >> Is that like from the white chicks soundtrack?
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.100]   >> Possibly.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.420]   >> So anyway, that's not all.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.500]   It's a five day festival and the iTunes Festival is fun.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.060]   The way they do it is they, and the only problem is because it's been in the UK.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   It's always been in the middle of the day for us in the States, right?
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   It's like 1 p.m.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.060]   The acts go on stage.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.060]   So this will--
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   >> Now it's going to be in the middle of the night in the UK.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.060]   >> Sorry, UK.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.060]   At least for those five days.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.060]   But usually it's one act a day.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.780]   So 1, 2, 3, 4, there's going to be one more act, I guess.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.700]   More artists will be announced at a later date.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:29.420]   All five nights will be free as a live or on-demand stream on the iTunes store.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.060]   Best way to watch it is the Apple TV.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.060]   It's great.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   It's like you're at the concert.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.060]   It's really fun.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.980]   So I don't think they're getting rid of the London venue.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.420]   This is just in addition.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.420]   Or maybe not.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.980]   >> The London one just finished in September.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.980]   So it's kind of off-site.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.980]   >> Well this is a new one.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.820]   Oh, you're right.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:54.500]   They say a more than 400 artists have performed in front of more than 430,000 fans and live
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:00.940]   and tens of millions online at the iTunes Festival London over the years.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.620]   This is really, really cool.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.980]   I hope they do that at Southby.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.700]   And now I have a real reason to go back and do it.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.100]   Jim Dowerimple is a rock and roll fan.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.740]   He apparently goes to the London Festival.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.660]   And you just look for a guy with a big beard and Austin a couple of weeks.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.660]   >> Well, that won't be came out.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.660]   >> Plus.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.660]   >> And that won't be came out just with the big one.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.660]   >> It won't be.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.820]   >> It was evidently December 26, 2003.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.340]   Do we have video?
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.340]   >> Uh.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.100]   >> According to Alex Howard.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.740]   >> Can we get video of Kenny?
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   All right.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.780]   We got a, okay, that Mac Pro could go to who it?
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   No, I'd better not do that.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.780]   >> Don't do it.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.620]   >> No, I can't do that.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.860]   Here we go.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.140]   Kenny Rogers calls into a call for help with Thon, JC Calhoun.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   Turn up the audio.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.140]   >> All right, by that.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.860]   >> Great way to get the information sent direct to the manager mailbox.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.820]   >> So this is the call for help with Thon?
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   >> 50,000 plus other members.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.620]   >> I thought that was not a clip.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.620]   I'm trying to.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   >> That's all right.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.420]   This is just the usual promo at the beginning.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.820]   We'll cut out of that in a second.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.420]   >> The newsletters you want to get.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.380]   Robot Wars Damage Report, Tech TV Tips.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.820]   >> I had to do that every day for six years.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.620]   >> Subscribe to the call.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.620]   >> Nobody ever subscribed to the newsletter.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.620]   >> We did it.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.620]   >> There we go.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.620]   >> Now, let's see if we can get another call on.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.620]   We've only got 39.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.620]   I'd like to make it Lucky 40.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   Who do we have?
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.620]   >> Lucky indeed.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.620]   We are lucky to have this next question asked.

[00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:07.620]   >> I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.620]   >> I'll tell you when you have
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.620]   people like Jeff Gurner reading
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.620]   them to you, it's so great.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.620]   And I asked Daniel.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.620]   I said, do you have a preference
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.620]   when one or the other?
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.620]   He says, no.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.620]   But he said -- because I said,
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:19.620]   people say they don't like it
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.620]   when I say it, use the word read.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.620]   And, you know, he said,
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.620]   you should just say,
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.620]   receive.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.620]   >> You're receiving the book
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.620]   from the author.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.620]   Oh, I'm receiving the book from --
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.620]   because it's every word the author
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.620]   wrote, but it comes alive,
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.620]   and your brain does something
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.620]   really amazing with it,
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.620]   especially when it's a great
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.620]   performance like that,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.620]   where it's a movie that you see
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.620]   in your head.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.620]   >> It's ruined.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.620]   >> It has ruined me for writing.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.620]   >> I open up -- I open up
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.620]   Flipboard, and I'm like,
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   why doesn't this just read the
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.620]   art at me?
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.620]   >> Like, I don't want to read
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.620]   the city with my eyes hurt.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.620]   >> Oh, love it.

[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.620]   And even if you've not read
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:11.620]   his other books,

[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.620]   and there's one more.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.620]   I want to try to remember
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.620]   the most recent one.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   If you haven't killed a
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.620]   decision, that's right.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.620]   If you haven't read his other
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.620]   books, pick any one of them,
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.620]   but I think "influx" is a good
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.620]   one to start with.

[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.620]   We thank them so much for their
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.620]   support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.620]   And thank Daniel Suarez for
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   another amazing book at
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   Jeff Gurner for an amazing --
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   it is a performance.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.620]   I want to say performance.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   And if you haven't -- if you
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.620]   didn't see that triangulation,
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.620]   go ahead.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   Check it out before you get

[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.620]   because I think you'll agree
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.620]   this is definitely the book
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.620]   to get.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:51.620]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.620]   >> Can I put in a plug
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.620]   for triangulation?
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.620]   There are a lot of people who
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.620]   only listen to one
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.620]   Twitter podcast for the thing --
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.620]   they got started on Mac Break
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.620]   or another show,
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.620]   and they stay within their
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.620]   interest.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.620]   If you have -- if you will,
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.620]   I've been wondering, what is
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:06.620]   the second podcast you
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   should start subscribing to?
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.620]   I was oblivious to it until
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.620]   about a year ago,
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   and then I started
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.620]   subscribing to it,
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:13.620]   and now it is in that
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.620]   hallowed tier of,
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   "I don't care if I don't know
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.620]   who this guest is.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.620]   I know it's going to be a
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.620]   good interview."
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.620]   >> Thank you so much.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.620]   I am very honored.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.620]   >> Great stuff.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.620]   Your interview with Tim on
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   Tim's Vermeer was as good,
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620]   if not better,
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620]   than the movie itself.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.620]   That was a great movie.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620]   >> Yeah, Tim Jenison.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.620]   And Tim -- have you seen
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.620]   Tim's Vermeer now?
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.620]   >> I just saw it this weekend.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.620]   >> Because it's now starting
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.620]   to get into theaters.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.620]   >> What do you think?
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.620]   >> Really, really good.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.620]   It's -- I'll say my one
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.620]   negative thing about it,
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.620]   which is that I don't know why
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   Penn had to be on camera.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.620]   I don't know what the narration
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   had to be there because Tim
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   is just such a fascinating
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620]   guy that you just want him to
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.620]   talk to you personally for
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.620]   the entire two hours of it.
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   And when they skip -- and you
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.620]   want to know about -- wait a
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.620]   minute,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.620]   back up.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:59.620]   So your family had a
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   broken-player piano.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   You fixed the pit-player
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   piano, and then taught
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.620]   yourself how to play rock
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.620]   and roll by matching the
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   key presses to a fat-swaller
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.620]   piano roll.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.620]   You, sir, are a
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   steely-eyed missile man,
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.620]   and I wanted -- we'll get
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.620]   to the painting, but I want
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.620]   to know about you.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.620]   >> Tim Jenison is the guy who
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.620]   started New Tech.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.620]   He created the Tri-Caster,
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.620]   which we use.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   He's a brilliant inventor.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620]   And at one point, just, you
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   know, he was looking at a
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   Vermeer, the very famous
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.620]   music lesson -- in fact,
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.620]   I'll show you the original --
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.620]   which you can't see because
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.620]   it's a bucking in palace,
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.620]   unless you're a friend of the
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.620]   queen.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.620]   But he looked at it and he
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.620]   realized that optically it was
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.620]   perfect.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:43.620]   And he thought, "There's no
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.620]   way Vermeer painted this
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.620]   free hand."
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.620]   And so he reversed
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.620]   engineered a device that he
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.620]   believes -- and of course,
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.620]   there's no proof because Vermeer
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.620]   was keeping it quiet -- Vermeer
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.620]   must have used an optical
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.620]   device that he then used to
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.620]   paint an exact copy of the
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.620]   music lesson.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.620]   He actually built a studio,
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.620]   got models to pose, and
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.620]   apparently -- this movie is
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.620]   all about this process --
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.620]   apparently, his copy is
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.620]   virtually perfect.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.620]   It took him four years.
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.620]   And I think many art
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.620]   critics -- this was something
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   that painter David Hockney
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   actually supposed for some time.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.620]   And I think it kind of
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.620]   confirms that many art
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.620]   critics are kind of appalled
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.620]   by the idea that the great
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   master Vermeer might have
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.620]   used optical engineering.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.620]   >> Yeah, there's definitely
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.620]   been theories that a lot of
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.620]   artists actually use that.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.620]   And I know a lot of folks that
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   do paint movie posters and
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.620]   stuff like that, and that's
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.620]   kind of a very well-known
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.620]   technique or something like
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.620]   it to paint things very
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.620]   quickly.

[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.620]   Is that --

[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.620]   If you're familiar with the
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.620]   Showtime series that they did,
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.620]   pen and teller's bull's hit,
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.620]   it takes a form of that where
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.620]   pen really introduces it and
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.620]   their time when something
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.620]   needs to explain.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.620]   So, pen goes on to explain that
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.620]   when you put a lens in the
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.620]   middle of a flower and dark in

[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.620]   It's just that I think that
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.620]   there was -- they missed out on
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.620]   an opportunity for an intimacy
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.620]   between the viewer and Tim.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.620]   I don't think it was bad at all.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:33.620]   It's just that I was hoping --
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.620]   at the end of, like, I was just
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.620]   thirsty for more of Tim talking
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.620]   about himself and his worldview.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.620]   What really got to me -- I'm sorry,
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   this is turning into Tim's
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.620]   premiere weekly, but what really
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.620]   got to me is that, as you say,
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.620]   it wasn't just that, okay, I'll
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.620]   just -- I'm going to build a

[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because

[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.620]   I'm going to be able to do this because
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   this is why almost anybody should stop
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.620]   signing that figure that oh well the
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.620]   reason why you should definitely stick
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620]   with iOS is because the app library is
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.620]   like 10 times greater than it is on any
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.620]   other competing platform.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   It's like yeah but after you get the top
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.620]   the 300, 400 apps the quality tends to
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.620]   tail off rather precipitously does it not.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.620]   Walt Disney Studios launching a new
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.620]   movie app called Disney Movies Anywhere.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.620]   The app is free for iOS and you can use
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.620]   it to buy Disney Movies 20 bucks each
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.620]   420 films to choose from and the
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.620]   movies fortunately be viewable not only
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.620]   in the app but also within the iTunes
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.620]   library.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.620]   So this is an interesting model.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.620]   I don't know if anybody else who's done
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.620]   this Disney Movies Anywhere selling
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.620]   direct presumably Apple getting its 30%
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.620]   but of course 20 bucks 20 bucks there's
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.620]   still plenty of money to go around and
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.620]   I'm sure it's highly copy protected.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.620]   If you buy a movie in a Disney account
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.620]   that movie will show up in a linked
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.620]   iTunes account only so you've got to make
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   sure you're all linked up right there.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620]   If you're going to use it.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   Like a Disney boutique in the iTunes
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   store the way that those Apple and
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   Samsung boutiques are best buy.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.620]   Yeah exactly like that.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.620]   It's just too bad that it's so hard to
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.620]   buy DVD and then convert it into a
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.620]   completely non-dear--
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.620]   Oh wait a minute it's truly easy.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.620]   And often less than 20 bucks.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.620]   Easy for you.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.620]   Not easy for a lot of people.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.620]   I mean let's face it.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   Okay but it is now down to one app
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.620]   download and just you know just three
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.620]   or four days ago I did the exact--
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.620]   I turned out to do the exact same thing
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.620]   that I've done so many times where
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.620]   there's a movie on cable that I really
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.620]   liked and it's on cable so you get to
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   see it again and you're like okay now at
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.620]   this point I want to buy it and I go to
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   an online store and I can either buy it
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.620]   digitally for $9 or $10 or $10.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.620]   Or I can buy it on DVD for $5.80.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.620]   At which point you say why would I buy?
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:31.620]   It could be a little sick call.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.620]   Not that I would ever have an opinion.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.620]   And that's why it's so important that this
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.620]   app exists because the easier they make it
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.620]   the more likely you'll do it that way right?
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.620]   Yeah that keeps people from having
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:43.620]   their DVD collections on Netflix from just
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.620]   right but also there's--
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.620]   Build in the library as it comes in.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.620]   There's the other aspect that I don't
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.620]   know I don't kiss myself but my understanding
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.620]   is that people will buy a neighborhood
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.620]   like buy one copy of a Disney DVD and
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.620]   because you have these libraries that
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.620]   you just lend them out to your friends
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.620]   because if you have to buy one of every
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.620]   Disney movie that comes out there to
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.620]   keep your kids entertained that's just
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.620]   like how much money is that right?
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.620]   So I the friends of mine in this
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.620]   neighborhood and also relatives of mine
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.620]   who are in that that beat so that I was
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.620]   surprised that they wanted to want a
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   recommendation on like a mobile DVD player
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:21.620]   and I asked them why and they said well
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.620]   because I have an iPad I like my iPad but
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   the kids play DVDs because that's way way
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.620]   cheaper than buying content that I can
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.620]   really transport from place to place.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:35.620]   We bought Bambi on DVD and then I
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.620]   transferred to a V-- because Abbie when
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:39.620]   she was three wanted to watch it over and
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.620]   over again I transferred to VHS but the
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.620]   reason I did that A is so I could put
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.620]   the DVD away similar safe because I knew
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.620]   she'd scratch it but B so I could cut out
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   the part where spoiler alert
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.620]   Bambi's mom was killed and I cut that out
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:57.620]   and Abbie never saw that on the VHS tape
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.620]   I'm a good, I'm a good father
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.620]   forget all that other stuff I did that doesn't count.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.620]   Our show today is brought to you by

[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.620]   week let's start with Renee Richie this week
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   so I was gonna do two picks but I ran out of time
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.620]   I figured I would pick something that's more
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.620]   it's not available now but the demonstration of it
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.620]   was so impressive I wanted to give it some attention
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.620]   and that's the Wolfram language it's by the same
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.620]   people who did Mathematica the same people who did
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.620]   Wolfram Alpha and it's basically the language that
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.620]   runs Wolfram Alpha and there's a video that went up
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.620]   today that shows what you can do with it and the
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.620]   first three quarters of the video are sort of
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   oh yeah you can do any of that in Mathematica
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.620]   that's not so impressive when you get to the last
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.620]   quarter of the video and they show you how you can
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.620]   do all of it as a language and how you can tie it
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:25.620]   into mobile devices and web interfaces and how
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:28.620]   conceivably a child can use the symbolic nature of
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.620]   the language as one of their first pro explorations
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.620]   of programming it starts to become hugely exciting
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:37.620]   and it is that that symbolic nature of the
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.620]   of the language where you can just pull data turn it
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.620]   into graphs take that graph put that graph in something else
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.620]   sorry no I mean if you show the video that'd be
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.620]   awesome because it's just such especially if you
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:50.620]   started about 75% through it's just a really amazing
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.620]   thing to look at another fellow we found on
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.620]   triangulation Stephen Wolfram is so amazing so this
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:01.620]   language is really kind of an abstract of what
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.620]   they've been using for years in Mathematica right?
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.620]   yeah and he said he spent I think it's been 30 years
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.620]   on making it highly it's an incredibly large is
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.620]   the scope and the breadth of it is fantastic but
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.620]   what they wanted to do is make it consistent so
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.620]   that once you did all these things it would be
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.620]   vaguely similar even if you're using radically
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.620]   different parts of it is mostly going to be for
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.620]   somebody who's used to manipulating numbers right
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.620]   as a scientist or a statistician.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.620]   I would love to see what was interesting too is that
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.620]   there's a natural language that's a Raspberry
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.620]   Pi it runs on a Raspberry Pi it does and a bunch
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:41.620]   of mobile devices and if you can imagine they have
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.620]   natural text language as a as a front point to this now
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.620]   but if you can imagine something like Google now or
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.620]   something like Siri interfacing with it the kinds
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.620]   and quality of queries that you'll be able to put in
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.620]   and get really usable really important results back
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.620]   with I think is going to be phenomenal.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.620]   it's also got the machine learning stuff that they
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.620]   use to kind of gen to teach the machine which means
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.620]   you could it really make it smarter just kind of
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:05.620]   intriguing.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.620]   Wow it play it works in all those devices.
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:10.620]   That is amazing.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.620]   There's a there's one function I can't wait to play
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.620]   with called predict.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.620]   That'd be great.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:18.620]   If you watch him typing in the queries it's just
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.620]   fantastic how he can type in a small thing take that
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.620]   make it a big thing take that make it an image take that
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.620]   make it a 3d model take that make the 3d model part of
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.620]   the next query.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.620]   What is the what is this going to cost a thousand
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.620]   bucks how is this going to work.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:36.620]   I he doesn't say it doesn't address that he does talk
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.620]   about how they'll be web interfaces for it and I'm
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.620]   sure they're going to make partnerships the way they
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   have with Wolfram Alpha right for it.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.620]   But I remember using you know logo turtle graphics when I was
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.620]   a kid as an entry point into programming and this is
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.620]   so much more exciting.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.620]   Wow.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.620]   This is worth learning wouldn't it.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620]   Very nice.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.620]   You know it's just excites me about the future of
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620]   computing.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.620]   It's interesting I think that you know you have certain
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.620]   people that just have an entirely different reality like
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   they have they've got a special relationship to something
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.620]   you know like Tesla and electricity you know he had he
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.620]   understood something about it and I think when you look at
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.620]   a lot of what's what Stephen Wolfram you know his
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:16.620]   understanding of math and how it applies itself to
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.620]   everything I think is just different than everyone else.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.620]   You know and much more powerful just much more powerful
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   and much more you know almost organic I guess I would say.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.620]   I mean it is I don't know if you haven't read or I can't
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.620]   say I read it page to page but I definitely spend time.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:32.620]   You read his book.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:33.620]   I didn't read the whole book.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:36.620]   I mean I do I definitely read sections I'm impressed of a
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.620]   new kind of science and it really is a very very interesting
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:45.620]   book as far as thinking about the way math you know really
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.620]   relates to science and reality and so it's it's a new way
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.620]   that's why.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.620]   These the easily the most intimidating person I've ever interviewed.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.620]   I mean not because he's totally nice and normal but you know
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.620]   you're talking to Stephen Wolfram.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.620]   It's like you know you know he must be thinking this guy's
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.620]   an idiot.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:08.620]   The only other guy that I was I was equally and he really
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.620]   did think I was an idiot was Murray Gellman the Nobel
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.620]   Prize winning physicist who discovered the quark.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   He really did think I was an idiot I interviewed him too and
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   he was right.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.620]   So I want to.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.620]   At some point did he just go Leo?
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.620]   No you can just tell he was going why am I talking to this guy?
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.620]   That's an idiot.
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:29.620]   Are you having are you having Dr. Gellman are you having
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:32.620]   any problems with your Kodak camera that could pop with
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.620]   all things.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.620]   Exactly.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.620]   I've got Alex Lindsey here he read your book.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.620]   I'm exactly like that I'm getting ready for the Conference
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.620]   of the World Affairs University of Colorado next month.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.620]   And as I like to say I have fixed the phones and laptops of
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.620]   some of the greatest minds of my generation.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:50.620]   Mine and any other generation because I'll be it's it'll be a
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:55.620]   panel where okay this man piloted a lunar piloted a lunar
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.620]   lunar lander on Apollo nine.
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.620]   This person solved a problem that has saved eight million lives
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.620]   and this person is pointing out it was the first one to point
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.620]   out the problems of the Gulf War and Andy says here he converts
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.620]   Mac and Posh is into aquariums.
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:14.620]   It does it does put it a perspective our chosen profession.
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:18.620]   I take a certain amount of pride in what I do.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:21.620]   I hope to help people with things that I write and I say I am
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.620]   quite aware that probably nobody will is alive today because of
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.620]   something that wrote or said.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.620]   Hey you're breaking up I don't know if we want to call him back
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.620]   or or maybe that is the plug on plug it thing.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.620]   But while you're doing that let's get Alex Lindsay's pick of the
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.620]   week.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.620]   By the way here this is from Marcus Brownlee he's posted this
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:46.620]   image of the new of the Galaxy S5 prototype before.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:48.620]   That's so mean.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:53.620]   So you know it would have been a lot easier because the big bandages
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:56.620]   you know the big bandages would just one would be one big band
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.620]   one big man just cut a little whole lot of it.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.620]   Yeah there you go.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.620]   What do you got for?
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:08.620]   So I have been I we're planning to do a bunch of shorts in the
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:11.620]   summer and so I started getting back into screenwriting and a
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.620]   friend of mine actually wrote a screenwriting application that
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.620]   I'm quite happy with.
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:17.620]   So I've been having a lot of fun.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.620]   They can be very expensive if you buy final draft or some of the
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:21.620]   big ones.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.620]   And they're all really good but I think also the final draft is
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.620]   a little intimidating is a lot to it is a lot going on.
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.620]   And I wanted something a little bit simpler that I could work
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.620]   through and so I got this this application slug line.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:34.620]   And slug line is I think about $49 or $50 or whatever.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:38.620]   And it's just a really great simple application that you can
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.620]   just get started on and it will build you know help you build.
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.620]   And you really you know you may think that you want to just use
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.620]   you know pages or something like that to do it but there's a lot
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.620]   of tools within you know simple tools and this one keeps it
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.620]   it's just not as intimidating as a lot of the other places to
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.620]   you know to write.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.620]   So as I've started to kind of work through some scripts it's
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.620]   just nice because you can outline things you can comment
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.620]   things out so they won't print out when you don't want to use
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.620]   them you know if you want to come back to them later.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.620]   But it helps you format them and really the formatting process
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:13.620]   really also just helps you think about the you know it actually
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.620]   helps you think about the script.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.620]   And so if you're thinking about it there's a demo there that you
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.620]   can download.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.620]   So if you're thinking about this and you want to see if it feels
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:26.620]   right for you you can download a demo from slugline.co
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:30.620]   and this was designed by a friend of mine Stu Mashle
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.620]   who I used to work with at ILM.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:37.620]   And so anyway so I really enjoy it.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.620]   So it took me a little while.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:45.620]   Stu sent me a you know has asked me to try it a year ago and
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.620]   it took me a little while because I wasn't writing scripts and
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.620]   now that I've gotten into it I figured oh give it a shot it's
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.620]   great.
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.620]   So it's kind of cool too because it's a text only format when you
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:55.620]   save it out.
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:56.620]   Right.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.620]   You're not saving it's some format you can never read.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.620]   Exactly.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.620]   It's not you're not this is the only place it lives you can send
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.620]   it out and work on it somewhere else you can bring it back in.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:07.620]   So it could even save it onto Google Drive and use Google word
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.620]   processor to edit it.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.620]   It's just using the fountain markup language.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.620]   So that's cool.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.620]   Anyways that's a 50 bucks.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.620]   Slugline.co if you want to see more and it's on the Mac app store.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.620]   We have Andy's audio fixed.
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:24.620]   It's beautiful.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.620]   Thank you very much.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.620]   I can't take Mr. Frost has to take some credit for this.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.620]   Oh, hey, Andy.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:33.620]   My pick is one of these one use only tools that you will really
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:34.620]   value.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:37.620]   I'm shopping for a new camera right now and number one I don't
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.620]   want to be one of those people who goes into a camera store to
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:44.620]   say hi I intend to buy a new camera at a discount on Amazon but
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:48.620]   can I use your store to get a sense for what the camera actually
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:52.620]   looks like I have no intention of actually buying from you.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.620]   And not only that but there's so many cameras out there that you
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.620]   can never really know one store would even have all the ones
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.620]   that you're looking for anyway.
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.620]   So but one of the big things one of the big ideas that you're
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.620]   trying to process is what is this camera going to be like in
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.620]   my hands?
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.620]   What's the relative size yet?
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:11.620]   And so here is a simple tool called camera size at camera
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:15.620]   size dot com which all it does is it has two pop ups and let's say
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:20.620]   if I'm thinking about getting like the Nikon D7100 and you just
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.620]   type in Nikon there's the D7100 you click and there's the Nikon
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:28.620]   and I'm also but I want to know how big or small would that be
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:32.620]   compared to this other camera I'm thinking about the Olympus
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:38.620]   whereas it the OMDE M1 and so we'll actually put two images.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:39.620]   Oops sorry.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.620]   I have some right as the camera I would get if I were you but
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:49.620]   are you but I love my OMDE M5 and I wish I had the one.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.620]   There it is.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.620]   Wait though the magic is about to happen.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.620]   There you go.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.620]   And so now here those two cameras are side by side to the same
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:01.620]   scale not only that but you can also say well how so the 7100 is
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.620]   just huge compared to the Olympus but how thick are these two
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.620]   cameras and so you could just ask for different elevations
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.620]   and different views of it and that will just give you so it's
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:15.620]   so valuable especially given the you can buy a camera from
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:17.620]   anywhere but it's so hard to get a sense of what it's like.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:21.620]   I would also recommend that you go on to YouTube and just look
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:24.620]   for review videos of the cameras that you're looking at not for
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.620]   the content so much so much as video of somebody holding this
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   camera as they talked to you about.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:34.620]   Well the effective megapixels with the DXO sensor rating of
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.620]   the camera is a little bit more than the camera.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:40.620]   So you can see the camera is a little bit more than the camera
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   but you turn off the sound and just look at how this person
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.620]   is handling it handling it and how it is but this tool itself
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:51.620]   I probably put about like a half a dozen to a dozen different
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:55.620]   cameras on a side by side including like my original the
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:59.620]   camera that I have now is Panasonic Lumix GX1.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.620]   That should be here somewhere.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:06.620]   I have a lot of those lenses I would be willing to change
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.620]   lenses for the right camera so but so given that I'm always
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:14.620]   that's the camera that camera around day to day right now that
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.620]   gives me a sense of okay so it's certainly bigger but it's not
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:22.620]   like it's overwhelmingly bigger so it's just such a simple tool
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:25.620]   I will not use it again for probably no two or three years
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.620]   before it comes time again to buy another decent camera but
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:33.620]   if you're going through that sort of process and you are being
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:35.620]   careful enough with your money that you're trying to get as
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.620]   much valuable information as possible camera size.com is
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.620]   really really a lot of help.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.620]   Very cool.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.620]   You'll let us know what you choose too.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:48.620]   I actually I didn't want to say it actually arrived this morning
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.620]   the one that I bought and I'm probably going to make it a pick
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.620]   of the week but I want to use it for a week.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.620]   Okay I can't wait.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.620]   I got to say that I'm already like I've probably taken a hundred
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.620]   photos inside my living room.
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:03.620]   I know that I know that I made exactly the right choice.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:09.620]   Once the snow thaws expect more outdoor pictures from Andy.
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:12.620]   This just come in from Dan Gooden who's very good rights for
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:15.620]   ours Technica thanks to the chat room for pointing this out.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:20.620]   New iOS Flaw makes devices new iOS Flaw makes devices susceptible
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:24.620]   to covert key logging a proof of concept app has been posted
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:26.620]   on the app store it affects.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:34.620]   iPhones running iOS 704 05 and the new 06 as well as those running
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:39.620]   on 6.1 point X fire eyes security firm they published this blog
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:43.620]   post last night I did not see it but thanks to Dan for highlighting
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.620]   it.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.620]   And I don't know more about this but I looked at it all morning.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:51.620]   It's still one of those non trivial things where you basically
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.620]   have to get an app built put it in the app store get someone you
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.620]   fish somebody so that they click on the link and install the app
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.620]   and then start monitoring and it uses background processing
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:05.620]   which in iOS 6 and previously times out and on iOS 7 still wakes
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:08.620]   up and goes to sleep so it's it's a bug that needs to be fixed
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.620]   absolutely but it is no reason to go panicking and running down
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:12.620]   the street.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.620]   More serious in jail broken iPhones of course because you don't have
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.620]   the protection of the app store but it seems like Apple would be
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.620]   fairly easy for Apple to keep those.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.620]   It was shown first for Android and jail broken iOS and now they
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.620]   have proof of concept to show that you can do it through the
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:25.620]   app store too.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.620]   My pick of the week is something actually because I keep trying
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:33.620]   to fix this Mac Pro by reinstalling OS 10 I found that it's
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:35.620]   you know there's certain things I install always day in day out
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.620]   on OS 10.
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.620]   It should be part of a set.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.620]   I've used in the past on Windows something called night night
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:45.620]   which is really sweet what you do is you you go through you do
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.620]   check marks next to all the apps you want and then it builds a
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.620]   app that you run and it will automatically download and
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.620]   install all the apps so that's kind of like a pre-built build but
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.620]   it downloads the latest versions etc.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:36:00.620]   Well there's there's now one for Macintosh it's called get
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:05.620]   Mac apps little different and it's probably worth explaining the
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.620]   difference it's at get Mac apps.com it's free so if you always
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.620]   install Chrome and Firefox you always install Dropbox and Google
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.620]   Drive as I do.
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.620]   This is it's for the most part open source although there's some
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:21.620]   commercial software like Evernote and Skitch caliber I know Andy
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.620]   likes that Thunderbird if you don't want to use Apple mail
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.620]   Skype you're doing a little ripping you're going to want handbrake
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:33.620]   of course you could put the gimp on there for file transfer they
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.620]   do have a panics transmit as well as cyber duck and file zilla
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.620]   and there's some development stuff coda which I always put on all
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.620]   my systems text Wrangler 2 I have a BB edit license but text
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.620]   Wrangler is great anyway these are all there now here's what
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:50.620]   happens instead of creating a an application for you creates a
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:54.620]   command line that you run in terminal.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.620]   Now if I would recommend because you could just cut and paste this
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:01.620]   into terminal but I think it's not a bad idea to look at the
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.620]   terminal code it generates just to validate that it's doing
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:08.620]   something you expect so here it is it makes a very big bash script
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:14.620]   that uses curl and and mounts the thing and installs runs the
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:19.620]   runs the application and then removes the DMG file which is
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:24.620]   nice cleans up after itself so I've looked at the code it's
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.620]   reliable that's the code it's generating that's what happens
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.620]   when you paste it in.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.620]   This seems like a very useful little tool to have lying
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:36.620]   around install all the basic Mac apps that you always want
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:41.620]   it's certainly going to save me a lot of time so that's my pick
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:46.620]   of the weekend it's free get Mac apps.com of course once you have
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.620]   your script you could modify it it's pretty easy once you see
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:51.620]   what's going on you can make your own script.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:53.620]   Well I think that does it for this show I want to thank Rene
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:56.620]   Richie for braving the weather and coming to his microphone in
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:59.620]   his living room or wherever you are.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.620]   I'm in my podcast studio but it's definitely shaping up it looks
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.620]   great.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620]   It's good I like it.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.620]   Thank you I just got my lights in I haven't I got by colored lights
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.620]   I have to install them now which one did you get it.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:16.620]   I'll hold one up I got one right here I forget the manufacturer
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.620]   but it's this bad boy here.
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.620]   Nice.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.620]   Oh I like this guy's built in flags and everything and it's got
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.620]   two white one white one yellow barn doors what do you call
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:30.620]   those barn doors barn doors very reflective and it's LED it's
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.620]   nice.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.620]   Wow that's great.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:36.620]   Getting there listening to Alex and this is not of course for
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:38.620]   the
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.620]   great
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.620]   I'm going to remember that you have it until
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.620]   Lassie comes out with a little big I'm going to be talking to
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:47.620]   guys and we'll see and say hey you know that load down on that
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:50.620]   thing just take it easy just be relaxed.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.620]   Huh?
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.620]   You can just ask him to send it to you instead of Leo and then
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.620]   he won't know that.
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:56.620]   Yeah I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.620]   I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.620]   I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.620]   I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:07.620]   I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.620]   You know it still says available Q1 2014.
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.620]   Maybe we got a little more time.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:15.620]   Yes you can have that for.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:19.620]   And it doesn't say how much this terabyte SS dual SSD is going
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.620]   to cost.
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.620]   But it's going to be awesome.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:24.620]   It's going to be over a thousand bucks don't you think it's
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.620]   got to be right.
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.620]   I don't know.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.620]   Anyway it's under bolt two and all that.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.620]   So but also check the USB ports.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.620]   We'll just convince there's something wrong.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:34.620]   We'll test it.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.620]   We'll throw some drives on it.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.620]   Anything else you want to plug as long as you're here?
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.620]   You know we're almost ready to let people join the training
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.620]   program so stay tuned for that.
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:45.620]   And next either next Mac break or the week Mac break after
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.620]   we'll open up the the barn doors.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.620]   We're just finishing up the sign up process.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:54.620]   So and we're going to it's a but it's training program to kind of
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.620]   take it take part in what we're doing in in Rwanda and
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.620]   learn along with us.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   That'll be on the pixel core.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.620]   But you can follow me on on G plus or Twitter.
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.620]   And it's probably the best places to find me and I'll be
[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:07.620]   announcing.
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:08.620]   I world this year.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:09.620]   I am not.
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:12.620]   Boy we've done a lot in the past training and so forth.
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:13.620]   You've you've done enough.
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:15.620]   I'm not asking you to do more.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.620]   No no no absolutely.
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:19.620]   You know it's so hard for me to do many of these anymore because
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.620]   of my my current travel schedule.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:25.620]   And so I've been kind of right now I'm slated during that time
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.620]   to be out of the country.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.620]   So I'm so I have I speak at NAB.

[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:40.620]   about live streaming for three hours I think on a Saturday and
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.620]   then on Sunday I'm talking about virtual sets and I am I have
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.620]   been allowed to talk a lot about hangouts.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.620]   I may say that we were under a contract usually with Google not
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:53.620]   to not to deal with a lot of the details and so.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.620]   But you finally can talk about the speed of the spots.
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:58.620]   I'm going to be spilling the beans at NAB on how we do a lot of
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.620]   the stuff and I'm going to be showing some of the software we've
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.620]   developed internally for for hangout.
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.620]   I have been able to go into our basement for four months.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.620]   So finally I'm glad they.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:10.620]   So I world Mac world I world is coming up at the end of March.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:14.620]   March 27th to 29th and then immediately following April 5th
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620]   through 10th.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.620]   I don't know what our coverage of NAB is going to be but I want to
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.620]   get some I'll be there all week.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:22.620]   We're doing some streaming for some clients there and and as I'll
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.620]   be speaking on the week I only speak on the weekend before Mac
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.620]   NAB so that I can cover it.
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:30.620]   So I'll be I'll be definitely there with with my with my glass
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620]   wandering around talking about stuff.
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:35.620]   That's a fun show for the kinds of stuff you do and a little
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.620]   bit for what we do to it's it's an expensive show for me usually.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:41.620]   I can't wait to see what Black magic's got.
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.620]   It's always I know.
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.620]   It's always like a black magic.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:44.620]   Yeah exactly.
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:46.620]   They got the big booth when you walk in and it's always like lots
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.620]   of grand and I always come over to when Leo used to have the
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:51.620]   booth when you used to have the studio there.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:53.620]   I'd walk over like okay we have to go shoot over here.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.620]   You can't believe what I just saw.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:57.620]   It's only a thousand dollars.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:00.620]   That was when they released the switchers which I now own.
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.620]   Quite a few of that.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.620]   Twenty.
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620]   Twenty.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620]   Twenty other switchers.
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.620]   So Alex I'm guessing that Mac break viewers can look forward to
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:09.620]   about five weeks worth of eight thousand dollar picks of the week
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:10.620]   from you right after anything.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.620]   Yes exactly.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.620]   I'm trying to try to take it easy on everybody but I am very
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.620]   excited.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.620]   There's going to be a lot of.
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.620]   I'm some shopping for satellite dishes.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.620]   Oh my god.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.620]   So it just gets bigger and bigger.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.620]   I got one but it's not big enough.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:24.620]   Oh well sorry.
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.620]   I was wondering what that was on the roof.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:28.620]   Only ten meters.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:29.620]   Exactly.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:33.620]   Mr. Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun Times joins us every week

[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:53.620]   I don't I don't want to say if I say which one it is then that
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.620]   that means it's like a review and an endorsement.
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:56.620]   We don't want to do that.
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.620]   I've had only a couple of hours.
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:42:59.620]   I'm so jealous.
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.620]   I'm really jealous and I think you made the right choice.
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:02.620]   Okay.
