[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.880]   Mac Break Weekly, the show where you cover the latest news from Apple. It is super Tuesday
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.200]   here in California and Texas and Minnesota all over the country. How many states? A bunch of
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.000]   states voting and that's why Lori Gill is wearing her pink hair. Just because of super Tuesday.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The only reason I have pink hair for almost a year. That's it. Hello Lori Gill, managing editor
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.560]   of iMore.com. Hi. They are voting in Montreal and that's where Renee Richie is. He's at iMore.com.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.920]   Hello Renee. We have no such elections today, sir. We have them randomly whenever the queen feels
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   like it. I know I love that about you guys. You're crazy. What else is great? The vote of no
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.840]   confidence. Any time a government bill doesn't pass, you can have an election. It's just fantastic.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   Clean up all the cobwebs. Mr. Alex Lindsey is also here. Sands, I voted sticker, but
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   you're going to vote later in the day. Maybe not. Are you an anarchist? I'm not an anarchist. Okay.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.960]   Alex is. I think that would be a nihilist. Nihilist? Somebody who doesn't vote is a nihilist.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.560]   Someone just doesn't hear. I don't think there's anybody for a anarchy party. I would have attempted.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   090 dot media is the new streaming media guy, meet director at Alex Lindsey at the Twitter and
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   Andy and Akko is also here from Bastin, where I believe they're also voting. Some of us are
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.920]   voting. Some of us are drinking. Some of us are doing no. St. Patty's Day is coming up. So, you know.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.080]   The annual time in which you don't want to read the Boston Herald to find out who's annoyed with
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   what group and why they're being banned from the parade. Yes. That's. Yeah. That's why. Google keeps
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.240]   getting banned. I don't know why. I don't know why. So, I just want to let the word go forth.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.800]   That Steve Wozniak is not patient zero. Don't play. Don't blame Steve. No, Steve, you know what?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:04.000]   Steve is a big-hearted bear of a guy who doesn't, I think he's not, he has no filter. He has no,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.160]   he has a playful nature. Yeah. Yes. And so, he kind of got some attention
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.200]   tweeting yesterday, checking out Janet's bad cough. They came back from Asia, January 4th,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.320]   just came back from China. This is what got him in a little trouble, may have both been
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:31.840]   patient zero in the US. And of course, all of Wozniak's tweets come from swarm because maybe he
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.680]   forgot that he connected his four square to his Twitter. I don't know. But they're always check-ins.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.880]   So, he's at the West Coast Sports Institute in Santa Clara. He was interviewed later and said,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.320]   "Yeah, both Janet and I were really sick." When we came back, he said, "I could hardly move for a
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   week." He had an engagement in Las Vegas and he stayed home. But I think it's safe to say,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.240]   Janet later was diagnosed with a sinus infection. I think it's safe to say that Steve Wozniak is not
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.640]   patient zero. Yeah. Another thing is, how did she go two months without getting checked with a
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.960]   sinus infection? I know with a sinus infection, that must have been awful. I've had that before.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's very painful. That usually takes me days. I can't handle any more givings than drugs.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.280]   It's completely terrible, right? Yeah. So, Katie, my best friend is actually a lot like the Woz,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.560]   I would assume, in that he is constantly sending me messages of things that he wants to tweet.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.120]   And I'm constantly saying, like, I'm saying things about that. Yeah, at least he says it to you.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.160]   That's a humor. Exactly. He's got that sense of humor. And he's like, "Do you think people would
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.720]   think this is funny?" And I think your friends will think this is funny, but people on the internet,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.120]   not so much, don't tweet it. Don't tweet it. Thank you for noting your three quarters of my tweets.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.080]   Yeah. Everybody needs a filter. Yeah. Yeah. But I had a, I had a, I was tweeting something
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   this morning and I thought I'd press the post button, but I didn't. So I had to press it twice.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.640]   I suddenly thought that would be such a great feature for every app in which you are going to
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   post anything to anywhere that it won't post until you click it the second time. And it won't tell you,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.120]   it won't be a warning. It'll just say, oh, oh, gosh, there was a typo in that. Thank God,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.080]   I didn't post that. Of course, USA Today being the newspaper record followed it up,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.240]   called was, took a great picture. Took a great picture. He says, both was in Janet had sore
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.520]   throats and coughs when they returned from Southeast Asia. He was scheduled to make a handful of
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.640]   appearances in Las Vegas right after the trip only made a couple. I couldn't speak because he
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.840]   lost his voice. We canceled everything else to head home. I couldn't move out of bed for two days.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   I did tell everyone I was sick and stayed away from almost all in Las Vegas.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.000]   Was said it was the worst flu of our lives. Janet was coughing up blood. That does not sound like a
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.040]   sinus. No, that's not good. Went to the hospital. They said it was no American flu.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.200]   We've not been able to get tested. That's the problem right now. Had our return from Southeast Asia
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.120]   been today, we certainly have been tested and quarantined with the symptoms we had. It wasn't treated
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.960]   as important January 4th. He noticed he noticed this is the sad state of our country right now.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.320]   He notified the Centers for Disease Control, but received a form letter advising him to wash his hands.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:31.520]   Okay. Well, he's got a good thing to do. Yeah, a little late. Might have said something like,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   and don't go out in public for 14 days. I don't know. This seems like there could
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.560]   have been. And don't tweet and whatever you do, don't say you're patient zero.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.440]   All right. I should I just had to bring that up. He's fine. He's fine. Sure.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.760]   It was I do wonder where the line is between being forthright about your travel to make sure
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   that if you did pick up something that you can be quarantined or at least be observed and not
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.200]   wanting to put your entire community in a panic just because you've been in an airport outside
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.720]   of the United States anytime in the last two months. Yeah. Because we're starting to tip the
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   regarding this starting to tip over into that that thick border between being well advised,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.840]   being well informed, being well prepared, and suddenly like now the now restaurants in Chinatown
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.200]   are having trouble booking tables, right? Which is just stupid. We are, you know,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.880]   South by Southwest will continue in a couple of weeks, but already Twitter and Facebook have
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.240]   announced they won't be going. Facebook is quitting everything. Yeah.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.880]   Yeah. Facebook is an event. Facebook is out. Well, and if I were the boss, and I am the boss of
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.400]   this company, if I were the boss, I would say, look, don't don't take any chances. No, no one
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   necessary travel. We're flying least an iron flying estate for an event on Thursday at Worldwide
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:09:00.400]   Technology. One of our sponsors, we're doing a meetup at the train wreck saloon tomorrow night.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.000]   That's going to be a train wreck. Are you in St. Louis? Oh, yes, you are. Alex is on the panel.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.440]   I'll be there. Alex is on the panel. I forgot Marijo Foley and Alex are on the panel. We'll be
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.080]   talking about the tech and the cloud. The panel will be broadcast. We'll make a video of it and
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   send you a VHS tape. But in the meanwhile, you have to be a WWT customer to attend the event live.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.040]   So I'm hoping that will cut back. Actually, actually, they just opened it up. They just opened
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   it up to advance. That tells you something. So if you are not sick and if you are willing to
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.040]   greet Leo at a distance with an elbow, I'll do elbow bumps. I'll pose for the foot bumps,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.960]   like in the meme. I'm coming with a big helmet. But also we are looking at, and I think it's
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:54.080]   prudent to look at work at home options. We are announcing now that we're going to close the studio
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   for the foreseeable future. A number of our employees have expressed concern about
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.080]   studio guests. So I apologize if you had tickets to come see any of the shows, but we're going to
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:12.560]   turn that off at least until the coast is clear. So I apologize. But again, this is something you
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.520]   do for employees. I'm not actually personally concerned. If I die, so what? But it would be
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:30.000]   terrible. But phone calls keep coming in. So I know actually the Johnny Carson joke is when you
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.440]   die, phone calls taper off, but your nails keep growing. Oh, no, but that's a terrible joke too.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.560]   So I wish I hadn't said that rapidly turning into the
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:47.600]   Nevermind. I know a lot of the companies are almost a lot of the companies are canceling
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   though. I mean, sales force has canceled a lot of big companies are canceling. And I think no
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.920]   travel again, if you have employees, it's a hard thing to say, no, no, you got to go do this. This
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.760]   is your job. It's a very hard thing to say. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't have sick
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.880]   time. They're not sick leave. See, people are coming in work. That's worse. So we've already told
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.360]   our employees and we're looking at ways we could do most of these shows via Skype. Somebody would
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.280]   have to be patient zero and come in and run the board. Sorry. But no, we're working looking at
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.040]   things. But at least for timing, I do want to mention we're going to turn off studio visitors
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.800]   from for the next whatever. I don't know how long is this going to go on? I don't know.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.000]   But isn't that the terrible, the terrible sign of how these problems tend to mound up
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   that we've created, at least in the United States, we've created a situation in which the people who
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   earned the least are always the people who were the front lines, people who are in contact with
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.560]   people. Also, the people who are not being paid so little, they can't afford to take one of their
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   sick days. Also, they're being paid so little that they can't afford health insurance. So they
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.480]   have good health insurance. So they can't, they're not going to be treated for this sort of stuff.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.680]   And so when the bees in a million years and replaced us of the dominant species
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   decides to do the apparently ontology and figure out what doomed the humans,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.840]   it could possibly be that all this fight about a minimum wage, perhaps I was short-sighted in the
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:17.280]   humans long-grained claims. Outside America is very weird when you're a kid watching TV and you
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.000]   hear socialism and liberalism being used as like insults when it's like the political parties and
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   the entire rest of the world. Yeah, isn't that funny? I know. So, well, will WWDC go on? F8's been
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.040]   canceled. It's a good question. We haven't heard about it. We haven't heard about it. We haven't
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.560]   had Google IOI. That's three months off. Google IO's in A. Google IO has already been announced
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.520]   and already been ticketed but the Apple has not yet announced WWDC as usual. So they can still
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   sort of need to be calling it off. Right? It would just. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.680]   I mean, I think that and this sounds like a joke and maybe halfway it is but I really think that
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.800]   this situation is going to it's going to be like deleting the phone jack, the headphone jack from
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:10.240]   telephones from phones because a whole bunch of these companies are going to do it and realize that
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.000]   wow, we got away with it. There are a lot of complaints about having these conferences just
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   simply absolutely just a virtual audience worldwide and not having it at a physical location anymore
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.320]   but we got by and maybe we try it again next year and the people who complain are going to be
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.160]   complaining less and less and less and then they realize that why are we putting together? Why are
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.840]   we building like a temporary theme park that lasts only three or four days once a year when it seems
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.640]   as though we can do this a lot more efficiently and have much greater penetration if we simply
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.120]   make sure that say that no, there is no audience for anybody anywhere. This is always going to be
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.840]   a virtual thing. Well, and the only reason we do it once a year is because it's so hard to do
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.520]   physically. If we were doing it, if we decided that we were going to do a studio and put it together
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.120]   and run those kinds of things and put the same effort into it that we put into a physical event
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.800]   and the same budget that we put into physical event, you got to realize like an event,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.560]   one of those big events in Moscone that covers all of the halls and takes over, you know, that's
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.280]   a $50 million dollar investment, you know, you know, so for one week.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.840]   The if we put all of that energy into something online, we could do it every week, every month,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   you know, it still wouldn't be as good though because people meeting face to face is what those
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.320]   conferences really are all about. It's not the products. It's not the information. It's meeting
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.400]   face to face, isn't it? It is the way we have done networking in the past. It doesn't need to be
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.080]   the only way. You know, when Pixelcore was a training organization in the early 2000s, we
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.600]   had 2000 members in 40 countries. No one saw each other in person and they still feel connected.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.840]   They built whole companies together without ever meeting each other. So it's not that it's just
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.240]   that you have to do different things to get people to, you know, it's a different kind of networking.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   You can't, it can't be casual or as casual and it's not something we know, but I think that there's
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.400]   a lot of opportunities to do that. And I think that there's a lot of downward pressure on
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.720]   large events in general. There's, you know, terrorist threats, there's pandemics, there's
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   carbon footprint, there's all these things that are, you know, that are pushing against having
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.200]   large conferences. Yeah, well, I wonder what the future holds. Their GDC, the Game Developers
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.960]   Conference, called off. Yeah. And this could be one of those moments, you know, like, you know,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.880]   do you think though, I think honestly, they won't be the issue. They call them off because the big
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.560]   tentpole companies aren't going, or they call them off because they genuinely worried about
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.760]   the business. The government regulation is saying you can't have large groups in some countries,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.440]   over 1000, some countries over 4000 or 5000. Yeah, they've closed the Louvre. You can't go see
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.720]   the Mona Lisa in Paris because, frankly, you have a gathering and one of the photos. And I think this
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.360]   is just hard for people to move around the planet now. This year, the people are thinking about it.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   I think next year, if if the virus comes back up next winter, I think you're going to have a
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.120]   seismic, you know, shift in how people do get togethers. And that's where we're really going to see kind
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   of an expansion there. The, you know, when, in, in, I don't know if I talked about this before on
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.240]   the show, but we had an issue where HD cam, you know, had an SR deck and tell everything on TV
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.000]   was recorded. And when the earthquake, there was two replicators for the SR deck. There was one in
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.960]   LA and one in Japan. And once a year, they'd move it to Japan to calibrate it. And while it was
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.160]   there was the big Japanese earthquake and it killed boat, it killed Sony's ability to replicate SR
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.840]   tapes. And I funded like half of a little studio selling my tapes for $1,000 each because everyone
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.040]   was desperate. They couldn't record their shows. And that was the end of tape. Like, like, that was,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.240]   you know, like literally within, within a year, there was no more tape. Like everyone went to solid
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   state. And so the question is always when you have this like shock mixed with, you know,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.320]   is are the tools out there to actually do it? And I would argue that the tools may not be there,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.600]   you know, to actually do a really good large scale online event. There's a lot of pieces of them and
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.040]   someone could piece them together, but they're not just higher Alex. I've done a couple.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.120]   So but but but but the but overall, I think that right now it's still something someone has to
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.560]   piece together. And I think that there's some real opportunities for for people to
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.520]   put together the tools to create great, great online. Apple did have its shareholders meeting
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.800]   on Wednesday. Tim Cook addressed coronavirus that it was a quote challenge when he's talking about it.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.000]   Han Hai, which, you know, Foxconn, which makes the iPhone says we're going to reopen at the end of
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.080]   March. But I think that there's a lot of big like maybe's or what ifs or who knows that conceivably
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.840]   to have some problem with the iPhone, the iPhone nine or the iPhone SE two or whatever you're going
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.360]   to call it, the iPhone SE successor, which supposedly will be announced this month. They also say
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:18.560]   they've reopened 30 of their 42 stores in China. Suppliers and mass assembly partners are slowly
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.520]   coming back up to speed. And some analysts have said the fallout could spill into the quarter ending
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:31.120]   in June. That's Mark Herman reporting in Bloomberg. That all conditional on what I think people
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.880]   thought a little while ago, which is that it was getting better in China. But I see that the numbers
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.480]   are going back up. So the diagnostics changed, right? They went from like kind of sort, we know it
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.440]   now they're doing genome level detection and it's much more accurate. And hey, we're working
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.960]   it accurately. And the number went up then and it's continuing to go up. So in other words, it's
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:19:01.200]   not it's not going away. So Cook said annual revenue from wearables, AirPods and Apple Watch
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.040]   compares with that. I don't know why you would say this, but he did with compares with that of
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:14.880]   Marriott International plus Visa. More than $40 billion. Yeah, of course, that's what I think when I
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.600]   that's what I use as a metric. Apple reported $10 billion in fiscal first quarter revenue for
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.680]   its wearables. So it's 10 billion a quarter, I guess is 40 billion. It's not a bad business.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.240]   Cook said for the first time Apple will open its online store in India this year with the first
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.520]   retail stores opening in 2021. So you can buy online this year and can actually walk into a store in
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.760]   India in 2021. He also talked about the company's rejection of the government's request to unlock
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.360]   phones in the attack at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. Don't think he said we have something
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:55.680]   we're not giving. Don't think we have something that we're not giving. Yeah. In other words,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   we've given them everything that we have. Apple won't create a backdoor to break into its devices.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:07.760]   Except their hearts. That's an interesting way of putting it. Don't think we have something we're
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.240]   not giving. We're not holding out on the government. Of course, Apple's building a new door.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:20.960]   And Apple's goal is to give is to have less and less. Right. We only want to give them what we
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.600]   can give them. And that's why end-to-end encryption and things like that are important. Presumably,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.720]   I think Renee, you're the one who explained this to me. Apple can give my cloud backups,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   including iCloud backups of things like WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.400]   That's encrypted, but Apple has the keys. So they apparently are giving that to... Yeah,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.040]   that's the hard part. There are certain things that Apple believes in the best interest of the
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.960]   customer if they can help them in case the customer gets locked out themselves. But the minute they
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.840]   do that, those things then become subject to subpoena. So Apple has carefully parsed through
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.160]   everything they think is just sacrosanct and is better if the customer loses it than anyone else
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.400]   ever gets access to it and the things where they think that it's safer for the customer to keep
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.360]   it, even if it means somebody else could theoretically get access to it. And those things have changed
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.200]   slightly. It changed a lot actually over time. I think they will keep changing over time,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.240]   but it's sad that we have to make those sorts of choose between customers safety and customer
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.760]   security all the time. You know what? Apple? You know who can't get Apple iPhones bad guys?
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:33.680]   Ryan Johnson, the director of Knives Out, in an interview said, "Apple won't let us do product
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.600]   placement if it's a villain." I mean, we had that comment. I was in a movie, I was working in a movie
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.480]   where that was a conversation 10 years ago. That's not surprising. That's not surprising.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.400]   It's not enough. It takes Star Wars from me. He has to take the rest of the movies from me as well.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.560]   It wasn't at the case in 24 that the bad guys all had Android phones and the good guys all had iPhones.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.360]   Well, they had Windows and Macs. Windows. Oh, that's what it was.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.640]   Yeah, but that was a good guy. It was a bad guy's drove Chevy's.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.320]   Really? In 24? So if a guy was driving a Chevy, you knew he was a bad guy?
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.440]   Yep. And then they had fake computers. They had fake Microsoft computers long before
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.160]   surface. Surface. Oh, I know they had very confusing.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.560]   They had Microsoft logos in the back of their computers.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.160]   Yeah. They were like, "Nobody makes that computer."
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:24.320]   So this is the wild world of product placement. Is Apple paying Knives Out?
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.400]   Is that true on TV+? Because on TV+ everybody has Apple products.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.200]   There are no bad guys on TV+. That's what's wrong with it.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.880]   Maybe it's shades of gray. It's only shades of space gray.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.400]   Who's the bad guy on TV+? Who was the bad guy in... Even Steve Carell? Was he a bad guy?
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.920]   He had a nice phone. They were all the heroes of their own stories, Leo.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.160]   That's right. As we all are.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   Product placement makes for weird situations. One of the weirdest things about
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.240]   about Pawnee, Indiana in parts and recreation was it was the one city in the entire world where
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.040]   everybody was using a Windows phone. It was the most amazing thing ever.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.160]   That's the worst giveaway movie. All the giants.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.040]   Those giant phones that no one really uses.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.640]   There's a certain shot that you can see. There's a beauty shot.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.360]   There's a shot that you see and you go, "Oh, they paid for that."
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   Immediately when they pick up the phone and go, "I gotta check something."
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.080]   You see them typing on it. It's always like a Samsung or something like that.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.160]   You're like, "Oh, they paid for that. They paid for that.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.480]   But CBS was so bad that they would not only do the placement. They would tell you about the
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.000]   product in the product placement. "Oh, my new Windows phone, I can easily search for
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.320]   contacts to catch the bad guy. Oh, this is terrible. It's got super fast shift.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.720]   Let's get in. If you look at it, let's get it started by the Black Eyed Peas.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.600]   I think they're using a Toshiba phone or something, but it was so clear.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.200]   I was like, "They probably paid for the whole video for this one shot."
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.080]   That's a question. I didn't read the interview.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.200]   Did Ryan Johnson say that Apple paid them for the good guys?
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.480]   No, if you want to use it in the, if you want to do Apple placement, they don't pay.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.560]   They will give you equipment. They don't pay for it.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.600]   They don't pay for it. They don't pay for it.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.720]   Like, you've got a thing. If I bought the phone, could I give a bad guy the phone?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.600]   You have to cover the logo. You have to?
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.360]   Yeah. If Apple gives it to you, you have to.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.800]   No, you buy it.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.240]   No.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.920]   Like, at least you're a hundred company.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.800]   No, no. You can't have a commercial product. A commercial media product can't use a logo.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.720]   That's why you Greek everything, right?
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.800]   Commercial, you don't want to have a commercial. If you're selling the movie...
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.680]   What's Greeking?
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.640]   Oh, Greeking is...
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.160]   When you turn English into Greek.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.520]   No, it's funny.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.440]   So, we Greek a lot of things. Like, a regular broadcast. You grab onto like a soda bottle or a water bottle or whatever.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.920]   And you use a pen, literally. You just connect things.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   So that it doesn't.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.360]   I've seen that.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.320]   And you just kind of connect it out. You either take off the logo or you...
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.200]   A lot of us print...
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.840]   I mean...
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.720]   So, if I see a...
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.680]   You print your own logo.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.880]   If I'm watching a show actually or a movie and I see a brand in the movie,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.600]   they had to get permission for those wise content.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.840]   They have to clear everything that's in the movie.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.400]   Yeah. There's a whole team that just sits there and clears logos.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.800]   Have we greeked all the brands in here and we haven't?
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.320]   Showtime.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.800]   We need to greek all the brands.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.920]   Even Greek brands.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   Apple didn't give me this phone.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.440]   For this kind of stuff.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.120]   Could they get this pulled down or consider this?
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.800]   Well, this is a great news area.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.080]   They totally could.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.640]   In the news...
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.920]   You're giving it...
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.080]   No, no, you're giving it away.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.400]   On a free...
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.960]   Well, also, it's about leverage.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.440]   Realize that any company who realizes that...
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.840]   If there's a trailer for a $400 million blockbuster
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.640]   and an Apple iPhone is being used as a trigger device on a weapon,
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:40.880]   they...
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.840]   Well, that I understand.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.640]   Well, no, I'm saying let's use that as an example.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.440]   They can basically say, "Hi, we're going to stop this move.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.720]   We're going to file in junctions to stop your $400 million movie
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.160]   with its $300 million marketing budget from being released.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.880]   Or would you like to cover up that logo digitally in post or research those scenes?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.840]   Because it's their trademark.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.680]   And like...
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.240]   Interesting.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.880]   I didn't know that.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.640]   The US military, if you want to do a movie,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.480]   they have all kinds of rules about...
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.240]   Like, you want to shoot off of a carrier?
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:08.800]   They want...
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.920]   Well, I understand that.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   But I'm saying that's...
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.040]   You're trespassing on government property.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.680]   That's different.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:13.760]   Right.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.840]   But there's always releases.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.160]   There's something we worry about all the time.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.200]   Like, we're hiding logos.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.320]   Like, when we're doing productions for commercial media products.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.600]   Like, if you're doing something free on YouTube or a podcast,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.120]   I don't think we've ever had to worry about that really.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.360]   But on large...
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.040]   Anything that is being sold or uses advertising...
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.520]   So...
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.840]   Is usually something we have to test.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.720]   So that's interesting.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.880]   Because in other words, if it's not product placement, I have to greek it.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.040]   So there may be an incentive not merely to get the free phones,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.360]   but just so I don't have to make everything look so funky.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.600]   To have these phones on set, get Apple to give them to me, then I can use them.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.120]   Well, it's...
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.280]   They don't have to pay me, but at least...
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.480]   It's so weird looking.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.440]   There's a bunch of a budget.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.080]   There's a bunch of photos where they're...
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.360]   You have a $100 million dollar...
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.320]   ...over by a square.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.080]   If you have a $100 million movie...
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.720]   But you see the one...
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.560]   You could afford to buy 10 iPhones.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.200]   Right.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.240]   But that's not the issue.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.160]   But if you look at like Alias, if you watch the old TV show,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.880]   Alias, you'll always see that little circle that was stuck on the...
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.600]   Yes.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.000]   Almost the same color as the laptop.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.880]   And just on the back.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.640]   And that's because they didn't get the approval.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   And here I am eating Tim Tams all the time on the show.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.800]   And they could take our show.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.640]   Brought to you by Tim Tams.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.280]   Are they approved?
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   Are they cleared?
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.480]   No.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.680]   I didn't clear the Tim Tams.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.080]   Clear!
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   And you didn't clear the Tim Tams.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.840]   I didn't either Greek for them or cleared them.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.800]   I can remember watching TV shows when...
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.920]   In the 10 years ago or whatever, where...
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   It would be sort of like a production TV show,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.400]   but there would be random people in them.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.520]   And they'd have like their hat logo would be blurred out,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.520]   or their t-shirt logo would be blurred out.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.360]   So there...
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.080]   Yeah, there's...
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.320]   Now sometimes it's because the hat or the t-shirt says...
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.520]   something horrible on it.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.880]   So it's not always a logo.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.480]   Yeah, I suppose that's true.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.040]   It says some...
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.240]   Has some exploit...
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.720]   Explo...
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.040]   So...
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.760]   Okay, we're going down a rabbit hole.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   I got another question.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.520]   So on the radio show, people are always asking when they call in,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.360]   "I had a real problem with this computer."
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.800]   Can I say the name and I always say, "Of course,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.840]   I want to know what name it was."
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.480]   I mean, typically...
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.360]   Should I not do that?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.640]   No, typically on a news...
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.440]   It's news.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.520]   News, you know, or advice and stuff like that.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.560]   That's not usually an issue.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.480]   It's when you're selling tickets to it.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.040]   Got it.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.080]   That it becomes...
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.680]   Selling tickets are using as advertising,
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.480]   is usually where it's...
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.280]   News is coverage.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.480]   And then there's a whole sides of the...
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.200]   Someone who does production,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.720]   like you look at James Bond,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.000]   whatever James Bond is driving,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.800]   that car company,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.400]   no one only paid a lot of money for that.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.760]   They paid a lot of money for him to drive.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.280]   Or the wristwatch he's wearing.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.000]   Absolutely.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.560]   All of that stuff.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.040]   That's all...
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   And so like, James Bond is a perfect example of...
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.920]   I think they pay for a huge chunk of the movie.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.160]   Oh yeah, it's a big deal when he stopped driving Aston Martin's
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.040]   and started driving...
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.600]   Or...
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.840]   Or...
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.480]   Or he's not really...
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.160]   You need to afford James Bond.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.360]   Does it drive a Ford?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:51.680]   He did.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.320]   It was in...
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.280]   It was in...
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.800]   Casino Royale, I think, when he ran into the car or something like that.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.680]   I remember seeing it going...
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.680]   Mr. Bond, would you drive this Mustang?
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.440]   It was like, I saw it, I was like...
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.240]   It's a huge...
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.160]   I think it was a BMW, I think, was a big one.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.960]   Yeah, BMW is a big one.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.520]   That was a big one.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.080]   That was a big one.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.480]   That was a big one.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:06.880]   That was the big one.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.840]   James Bond, yeah.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.680]   Was there a lot of AMC cars and like,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.880]   you only lived twice or something?
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.960]   Which ever one where he was partnered up with that?
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   James Bond drive so grim.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.200]   It was...
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.360]   It was one movie.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.880]   One movie James Bond of a grand.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   You need that big backseat of AMC,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.280]   Pacer to beat James Bond in the final shot.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.520]   Oh my god.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.720]   Wow, I'm learning a lot here.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.760]   I didn't know you did feature film production.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.400]   Yeah, it's the little thing I did on the side.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.760]   Once or twice.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.800]   Yeah, it worked a couple of times.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.720]   Somebody said Alex Lindsay could not possibly
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.080]   worked on the Empire Strikes Back.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.280]   He would have been eight.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.560]   I did not work on the Empire Strikes Back.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.640]   You did Princess Leia's ship for...
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.760]   Episode one.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.040]   Oh, episode three, number one.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.120]   One which is the fourth movie.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.640]   The fourth queen Amidala.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.440]   Queen Amidala.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.320]   I didn't work for that.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:54.720]   I didn't work for that.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.160]   But it was typically known as Queen ship.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:56.640]   Thank you.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.520]   The queen ship.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.400]   It was what I worked for.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.840]   The queen ship.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.200]   Queen Amidala's.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.080]   Did I say basically...
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.880]   Did I say basically...
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.920]   Even I'm not that stupid.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.160]   It was basically a shiny 50s styling of an SR-71.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.840]   With alpefins.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.440]   Oh, the, the, the.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.120]   Without the fins.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.560]   Bathered me every time I saw it.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.280]   I was like, "It doesn't have the fins."
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.560]   The black, it's a black bird.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.040]   Black bird.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.440]   I once.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.000]   Black bird.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.200]   I tried to...
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.800]   It did look like a black bird.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.920]   It's a shiny black bird.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.320]   It is.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   I didn't even think of it.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.560]   When I was modeling the previous one,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.480]   I called, I contacted the PR for Lockheed and I said,
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.320]   "Hey, how about you guys have your engineers up here?
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.200]   I'll give you a tour of the ranch."
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.360]   And our engineers could come down.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.520]   No, no, we'd come down and visit the skunk works.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.320]   And they were like,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.440]   "This is a top secret facility."
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.480]   And I said, "So is this."
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.840]   We're a top secret facility.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.120]   And did that work?
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.680]   As he goes,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.200]   she goes, "We work for the United States government."
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.080]   I'm like, "We work for George."
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.200]   Even I...
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   And...
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:45.680]   And...
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.760]   That's what I come to say.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.720]   And she sent me a great...
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.000]   She sent me a great...
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   It's a document and drawings of...
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.560]   Like exterior drawings of the S-71.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.680]   So that I could build the model.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.120]   That's the stealth fighter.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.320]   Well, it wasn't stealth by then.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.640]   It was...
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.840]   Oh, not so stealth.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.560]   It was near retirement.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.280]   They have one of the...
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.440]   Udmar Houdesi...
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   Oh, dasie.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.480]   Oh, dasie.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.040]   That's really cool.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.600]   Whatever that is.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.200]   The Air and Space Museum.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.760]   They have one...
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.560]   They have a couple of them.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.920]   There's one of the Air and Space Museum.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.400]   There's one...
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.600]   It's really neat to see that in person.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.040]   There's one at Pima Air Force.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.480]   Pima Air Museum had one.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.360]   Or at least had one.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.600]   And...
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.640]   There's one in Florida.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.600]   Thanks to the chat room.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.480]   I have a list of all the James Bond vehicles...
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.040]   In every James Bond movie in...
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.440]   See, look.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.160]   Ford Warner Company.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:30.640]   There was...
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.120]   Yeah, OK.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.560]   Octopusi was an alpha-rame,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.320]   a quantum solace-spector...
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.840]   No, go to Goon Rayco.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.720]   Goon Rayl. Goon Rayl.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:36.960]   Goon Rayl.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   AMC.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.240]   AMC.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:38.960]   AMC.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.680]   Hey, the man with the Golden Gun.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.440]   No wonder I didn't see that movie.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.880]   AMC Matador.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.400]   Oh my god.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.760]   Moon Rayco, he was driving a Concorde or a G-Wagon near.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.160]   Keep Cherokee in a view to kill CJ.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.280]   J-7, that's a good car.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.160]   That's a good vehicle.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.520]   There's the Aston Martin's that I remember from the real James Bond.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.000]   Yes.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.040]   Caught Concorde.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.560]   Oh, and Skyfall, they came back, right?
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.520]   They brought it back.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.160]   Wow.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.400]   Yeah, they're doing a lot of nostalgia stuff in these latest bonds.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.440]   Wow.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.480]   And an Audi in some of the more recent ones.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.240]   Do you expect me to talk to Mr Bond?
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.440]   I expect you to die.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   To die.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   Oh.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.080]   Right there, see?
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.320]   See?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.080]   When he's on the arm.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.120]   He already found the clip.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.480]   How did you find that so fast?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.040]   Because I'm--
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.160]   Is that Dr. No?
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.120]   No, this is a sound.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.680]   Because he's out.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.800]   Oh, because he's driving around.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.000]   The reason I'm driving a Ford.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.960]   He's driving a little Ford.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.320]   Like a crappy Ford rental.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.280]   That's kind of embarrassing.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.000]   Here, give it to me here.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.280]   That could--
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.040]   No, no, no, no, it'll get pulled down.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.720]   So you can't go fullscreen, but you actually can show.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.080]   This is as long as you don't go fullscreen.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.200]   No, we can't.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.120]   Carsten is now the copy of the algorithm.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.560]   The algorithm won't see that.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.280]   You know that, right?
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.160]   Carsten is looking at me very mentally.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:50.720]   It's not really meant to be a movie.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.200]   It's by show.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.720]   It's just an algorithm.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.080]   It's just an algorithm, Carsten.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.800]   It's just a machine.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.120]   Oh, the SR-71 is not a fighter.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.480]   It was a stealth bomber.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.600]   Yeah, this is a good--
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.640]   Yes, or 71.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.600]   I'm not read it.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.960]   If you just call the SR-71 the fastest plane ever,
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.720]   that will start.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.440]   It was it?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:09.760]   No.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.240]   No, it's not.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.440]   Not even close.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.520]   But it was the sneakiest plane ever.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.320]   In some ways.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.880]   Some ways.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.360]   It's a spy plane.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.920]   Sorry.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.040]   S is for spy.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.200]   F is for fighter.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.760]   B is for bomber.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.080]   Oh, there's a method to their madness.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.960]   There were a couple of different--
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.120]   No, anyway, that's a whole other conversation.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.480]   Yeah, excuse me, Leo.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.440]   This is how 70 was.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.280]   We entirely were kind of since aircraft.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:35.760]   They did work on it.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.240]   Sorry.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.040]   I think Alex caught himself almost about to violate a hell of a--
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.760]   An idea.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.040]   And the rat hole to--
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.760]   What did he say?
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.800]   What did he say?
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.280]   Nothing.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.760]   Go ahead.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.240]   Nothing.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.160]   Man, our show today brought to you by Cap Terra.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.360]   If you are using old software in your business,
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.240]   everybody is, right?
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.880]   That's why Windows XP lives,
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.120]   because people have software that won't run on anything,
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.040]   but IE8, things like that.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.120]   You're suffering unnecessarily.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.320]   Needless suffering.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.760]   Unfortunately, line of business software
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.960]   does not often get updated.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.480]   Sometimes it was written by the boss's nephew, Joey,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.240]   when he was intern.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.320]   And Joey went on to bigger and better things.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.680]   He's now a dentist and Muncie,
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.320]   but the software lives on.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.520]   Nobody's supporting it.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.280]   You got to get--
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.160]   Here's the good news.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.000]   There's great brand new fresh state-of-the-art software
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.280]   for every single business.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   And you could find it at Cap Terra,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.920]   C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A.com.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.360]   The website, millions of people use every month
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.440]   to find software for their team or their business.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.600]   You can filter it down by--
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   We'll start with there's 700 categories of software,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.360]   everything from project management to email marketing,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.600]   IT management software, even line of business software,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.120]   like Doggroom or Yoga Studio, mortuary management.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   Then filter once you pick your category,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.080]   filter the software down by price and features.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.720]   You could even do a side-by-side comparison chart,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.320]   like they used to do in the magazines.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.760]   So compare the options side-by-side,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.240]   save your favorites, then the best part kicks in.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.720]   More than one and a quarter million reviews
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.320]   from verified users.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   Did you hear that?
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.240]   One and a quarter million reviews.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.200]   Visit Cap Terra, C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A.com.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.720]   Now wait a minute.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.760]   Now I don't know what category,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   but I see the names of the software are
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.240]   Nvorus, Cryptlex and Keygen.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   I'm going to guess these are--
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.960]   this is for running a dental office.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.920]   No?
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.000]   What is this category?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.800]   I'm dying to know.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.680]   Licenses.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.400]   Licenses.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.200]   There you go.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.080]   Licensing software.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.480]   Look at that.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.040]   There's software for everything.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.600]   I forgot the best part.

[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.200]   one of the reasons there's so many good reviews,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.240]   not positive reviews, but useful reviews on there,
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.560]   is because people didn't pay anything for Cap Terra,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.200]   so they go back and they leave a review after they try the software.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.160]   Do the same.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.440]   It's just paying it forward.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.240]   Capeterra.com/MacBreak.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.200]   We love Cap Terra.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.320]   You can show your support for the show by going to that address.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.480]   Capeterra.com/MacBreak.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.040]   Capeterra is software selection.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.960]   Simplify.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.320]   Guys, I'm sorry, Alex scared me, so don't worry.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.040]   I made sure that this, this cellter water is safe to drink.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.600]   You did show that brand.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.360]   I don't know if I can, if I'm a good guy or a bad guy,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   so you know, a little gaffer table, so.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.320]   Rhymes with the--
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:56.800]   Crips.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.520]   Yeah, where's your iPhone?
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.080]   That's the question.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.360]   Are you using an Android phone?
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.920]   Actually, I'm using a Palm, thanks to a new licensing agreement.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.160]   That, you know, you got to make $1 if you can.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.680]   Chewsy geeks, choose Palm.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.760]   This Palm pre has turned out, turned my life.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.200]   TCL makes everything now.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.240]   I'm going to do, I think we did the coronavirus.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.360]   Okay, moving along.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:26.000]   Did you see Patrick Wardle's presentation at RSA?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.240]   Patrick, who is a former NSA hacker, we've mentioned in many times,
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.680]   he's also a really good utility programmer for a max.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.400]   He works at Jamf.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.760]   He's their iOS and Mac OS Enterprise Manager,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.320]   or no security researcher at the iOS and Enterprise Management Firm Jamf.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.600]   Former sponsor, by the way.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.800]   He says, hey, if you're a bad guy, you know what's cool?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:59.520]   Take, take, take advanced nation malware designed for the Mac
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.560]   and repurpose it.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.720]   They are incredibly well-funded.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.000]   This is, by the way, this is in his talk, repurposed malware,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.920]   a dark side of recycling.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   They are incredibly well-funded, well-resourced,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.600]   very motivated hacker groups in three-letter agencies
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.840]   that are creating amazing malware that's fully featured, also fully tested.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.480]   So, if you're a hacker, why not let these groups create malware
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.240]   and repurpose it for your own mission?
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:32.720]   So, he- I think he's- okay, he's not really telling people how to hack.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.440]   He's just pointing out, you know, the issue here is that this stuff gets out in the
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.680]   wild.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.800]   He took four pieces of Mac malware that have been using in the wild attacks
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.440]   over the past several years and repurposed them to report to command servers belonging to him.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.160]   From there, Wardle had full control over the recycled malware.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.480]   This feat allowed him to use well-developed and fully featured applications
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   to install his own malicious payloads,
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.360]   as staying- obtained screenshots and other sensitive data.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.320]   Obviously, he's not telling you how to do this.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.080]   He's just mentioning this is an issue.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.920]   This is all- I mean, that's most of the ransomware that we've seen
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.680]   all based on our own NSA code.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.080]   Right.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.360]   Not Petra.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.560]   One of the worst- and WannaCry, one of the worst malware worms,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.840]   was based on Eternal Blue, a Windows exploit stolen from the National Security Agency.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.680]   All malware are organized into families, and it's all about, hey, this one was super,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.880]   super effective before they managed to find the good people managed to find this one weakness
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.960]   that could exploit to shut it down.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.600]   So, let's fix that weakness and release version 2.0.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:53.120]   Well, and it's also why a lot of times we don't retaliate for like Russian interventions,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.520]   stuff like that is because we'd have to give up, you know, show what we're- what we can do.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:05.680]   So, I think that if I'm gonna draw a moral from his talk is these nation-states are creating
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:11.600]   malware. It's impossible for them to keep a lid on it, and by doing so, they're empowering
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.480]   all of the- many of the security problems we're all suffering right now.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:23.440]   And it's not just Max, obviously. This is from Dan Gooden's article in Ice Technica, by the way,
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.160]   let's give credit to Dan. He's one of the best security writers out there.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.960]   Wardell said, "The idea is to let those with more time, money, and resources do all the hard work."
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.880]   Wow. He used to work at the NSA. That's the funny thing.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.440]   Hey, he knows. He knows.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.920]   There's a lot of really smart people making really good code.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.160]   I think when someone saw the Stuxnet thing, they immediately were like, "This is the United States
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.120]   because no one writes code like that." There's nothing sloppy about that code.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.520]   Yeah, I think Stuxnet was Israel and the United States working in tandem.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.480]   And it's terrifying because what it can do is get into your USB system which makes it almost
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:07.120]   impossible to pry it out. Siemens, I think, figured out how to see it. I like to see if it's there,
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.280]   but it's very hard to extract reliably. You pretty much just throw the machine away.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:20.080]   Yeah, there was that story and the other depressing story was the vulnerability in
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.960]   Google's Titan security system that the researcher spent like six months getting them to fix.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.760]   And he's like, "Your project zero deadline is like what? 90 days? You're giving me the run around
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.640]   for six months? Google's doing it." I use Yuba Keys, not Project Titan Keys,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.120]   kind of for that reason. Project Titan Keys, I was always a little nervous. They were made in China.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.960]   But as anybody found anything with Yuba Keys, I have the new one that the 5CI that has the,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.240]   I love it, has a lightning port on one side and a Type C on the other.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:54.160]   That's kind of quirky. Yeah. But as I hope anybody else has Yuba Key in your USB,
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.520]   you'll get juice checked all over again. You can only make it harder. It's like washing your hands.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.960]   New report from Ming Chi Quo. Let's give this a confidence rating.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   Apple is working on six, count them six, it's a half dozen, six to one half dozen of the other.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:22.880]   And mini LED products, including a new, a new 14.1 inch MacBook Pro and refreshed iMac Pro.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:31.680]   Mini LED is a screen technology that I thought wasn't yet ready for prime time.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.720]   That's micro LED. The confusing thing. Oh, micro LED.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.800]   Oh, this is a little bigger. It's mini LED. Yeah. Yeah. Not micro.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:45.440]   Thank you for clarifying that. Mini LED is out. And the difference is micro LED is a direct view
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.240]   product with micro LEDs that you can mix and match to make a screen of any arbitrary size.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.520]   Mini LED is about the backlight. Well, micro LED is still expensive. They're only giving us small
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.920]   tiles and telling us to mix and match so that it won't look like it's a billion dollars for
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.760]   elevation. So the mini LED is a very, very small, I think very, very small red green and blue LEDs,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.880]   backlights and more discrete backlighting zones. So there's less like the detrimental effects with
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.280]   LEDs that you have a lot of backlight glare to minimize that by having different zones. Yeah.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:22.080]   So that would be that would make sense, right? As mini LED, I think it's in widespread production,
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:28.240]   we saw a lot of mini LED TVs at CES. It's just an LCD technology. It's a new form of backlight,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.360]   basically. So that would make sense if Apple's gonna make new products that they would use that
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.360]   in their screens. Yes. So it's supposed to be, well, the rumor has it that that's what they were
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:43.120]   using in the Pro Display XDR, but it turned out they were just using LED with small LED. Yeah,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.920]   with really small discrete not not mini, not micro, but just really small.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.840]   Yeah. Well, it was mostly the way that they zoned it, but the rumors that Apple's been investing
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.920]   in both this and micro LED for a long time. And it makes sense that it'll be the next
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:04.320]   display technology. OLED is a wonderful, but incredibly flawed technology that Apple and every other
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.400]   company has to work super hard to mitigate. Like I was watching some of the videos with the new
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.680]   Galaxy S20, which has the best OLED display on the market. And when people are shifting refresh rates,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.160]   the white point literally changes. It's just, it's just LED, OLED makes things so hard that
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.600]   everybody is desperate to find something that is as easy as LED and LCD, but that gives you
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.920]   the contrast ratio and dynamic range and everything else that makes OLED so good.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.640]   And maybe they're getting there. Actually, I buried the lead because the thing that's most
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:40.080]   interesting in this note is the 14.1 inch MacBook Pro. Right now there's 13s and 16s and the old 15s.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:46.560]   14 is a sweet spot. I think that's a nice size. Same size, but less bezel, just like the 15
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:53.040]   to 16. So it'd be a 13 with a smaller bezel. So you'd get 14 inches, which is I think
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.280]   perfect 13 is just a little too small for 15 is a little too big. I think 14 is a Goldilocks point.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:06.000]   Yeah. I know. I want an 18 with no. You want bigger. Just like, you want the old 17 inch MacBook
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.440]   with no bezel, but I just, but I don't want you to make it smaller. I want you to just fill out
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.720]   that bezel with more with pixels. That would be amazing. I do. I have to say I love my 17 inch
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.640]   laptop, my breakfast computer, because it really is a nice, it's too big. The reason is my breakfast
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.840]   computer is it's too big to have to round. So I just plop it down at the breakfast nook.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.400]   And that's it. It lives there, but it's really nice. It's really, and it's like five years old,
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   an old system 76. But that size is nice. It's like you're using it. That's the most,
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:40.720]   what's the case against having a USB-C lightning based, I'm sorry,
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:48.960]   USB-C based external to external screens. It's something that is about the size and form of an
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.360]   iPad, but isn't going to be as slow as using mirroring on an iPad. It would give you extra,
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.960]   extra real estate on your desktop, even if you can't necessarily have the big, big screen.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.320]   You mean, as a screen, so have your laptop plus a USB screen.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.400]   Yeah, I've always wondered why that hasn't really taken off there. You can get them, but they're not,
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.360]   they're very, once you, I used to, I had one for a couple of months to try out. And every time,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.600]   like I'd set up with like a second display next to me, there'd be so many people there at the
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.640]   Starbucks or the Panera's like, what is that? It's like, it's like a tiny, tiny, tiny little second
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.680]   monitors. Like, what's this? Like, it's something that you can get probably
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.120]   to Alibaba for like 110 bucks, right? You've never heard about it.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.000]   I've done that. It's like DisplayPort over USB-C. I'm sorry, that's the word I was looking for.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.960]   Yeah, I've definitely, I've had USB-
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.160]   Even just regular USB is fast enough to get a second screen.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   No, I'm, we have screens that are USB, just USB to USB screens.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:40.720]   They're a little-
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.960]   Bring that over because we use them as touch screens.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.160]   Father Robert was the one who showed us this at first, and John uses this all the time.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:55.680]   This is an Asus USB, it's Type-C, right? No, it's regular USB, USB-2, but it's a nice,
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.840]   and he uses that with his laptop. It's a nice screen.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.400]   It's almost like they took the lid off of an Asus laptop.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:07.920]   Right? And then there it is. And it's not, it wasn't expensive. How much? 120 bucks.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.200]   So you get the value of a second screen. I think it's fast enough,
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.800]   but you're right. If you had Type-C, it'd be even better. That'd be, you could have a nice screen
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.760]   if you want. Lots of people make those. You're right. I wonder why we don't see more of those.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.000]   And does it have a stand? Is that how you do it?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.760]   The cover turns into a stand.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   The cover, it has a cover like a Type-pad cover for the iPad, but it turns into a stand.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.320]   So that's a nice-
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.600]   And they make some of them with them. They really only work with PCs really well,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:41.440]   that are touch screens. So you can, you know, it's the old kind of capacitance
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   touch screen, so it's not great, but I'm not sure I'd want that.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.920]   Like 100 for bad words. It's useful.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.320]   Really?
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.360]   Yeah. If you want to have something where you're, what we would use it for is
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.880]   connecting it to a computer where we want to control, we just put our interface up,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.440]   the big buttons that you hit things while you're working in.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.520]   Here it is. The Asus, this is the most recent, I think, is the MB-
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.160]   One screen.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.120]   ... on B-E.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:08.720]   And it does auto rotation. See, there it is in your holiday in room.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.920]   So you carry it with you. But see, that's why I use the iPad, and I don't use do it anymore.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.440]   I use, what does Apple call it? The ghost display sidecar?
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.240]   The sidecar.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.520]   I should remember that.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.000]   Which is kind of like what Alex was describing as a touch screen interface.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.200]   That's your second screen. That's kind of what the iPad, what sidecar does now for Mac,
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.600]   MacBook and iPad is you kind of have that second screen that's touch sensitive.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.520]   For certain programs, it's kind of neat and works really well.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.640]   Not needed most of the time, but for some times it's kind of cool.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.240]   Asus does make a Type C, but it's a lot more expensive. It's like 50 bucks more for the Type C.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.040]   And here's one with a built-in battery.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.640]   Why would you want that?
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:49:00.080]   I would have to imagine that the reason a second screen for your laptop in a portable
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:06.400]   capacity isn't more popular is that it's just one extra thing that you have to unfold and fit
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:14.240]   on a table. Whereas if you have one 17 inch laptop, for example, it takes up one spot on your desk
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.320]   or your coffee table or whatever.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:22.480]   Even though the portable screens like that, they're lightweight and they're very thin.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.080]   They can just slip into your backpack. But once you actually set them up,
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.160]   you're taking up twice as much computer space on your tiny little coffee table.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.600]   And that's probably why they're not that popular.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.200]   They're intended to be portable, but they don't really fit in a portable life.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:39.680]   Right.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.200]   Yeah. Plus the other advantage of having the other fans having a 17 inches that if you're
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.000]   making the chassis itself bigger, you have room for a bigger battery. But we have a lot of situations
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.120]   where like Leo was saying, where I have this big wonderful laptop, but I don't actually take it
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.960]   out of the office because it's too big. And I mean, my pick of the week is kind of related to this
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:07.040]   conversation that I bought a new bag. And part of it was how if I'm buying this bag, which is really
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.840]   a buy it for life type of bag, I have to commit to never buying a laptop that is going to be
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.240]   going used for trips. That's going to be above a certain size. Now, I was very confident about
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.600]   that because they're making screens bigger by making the bezel smaller, like Renee said.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:28.800]   But there is a I have a friend who was using the that that that prison cafeteria plate size MacBook
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:35.600]   was 17 inch or was it 19? Yes. I wanted it was it was it was and I had it when he was he was still
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.160]   using it when I was reviewing like the original MacBook nothing. And I had to like get a picture
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:46.080]   of the MacBook nothing like the smallest MacBook ever made on top of this. And it looks like it
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.360]   looks like an iPad. I'm not talking about like the iPad Pro. It looked it was just like something
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.120]   looks like something this other Mac power book would eat, you know, for a snack. And so I love the
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.960]   fact that you having this kind of power inside something that doesn't require you to take something
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.840]   that looks like I'm taking a piece of big luggage with me just just to go to Starbucks to get a
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.720]   couple of hours emailed on. I do have to say since I do carry an iPad with along with my MacBook,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.120]   Sidecar is kind of the best of both worlds. I'm not getting anything extra and I've got that.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.200]   Right. And I will say I used the 17 inch for years and just loved it. And on a plane, if I got if
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:28.320]   I get into the exit row, I get open and you know, you saw what happened to Cassidy. Well,
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:36.080]   the Barstoo Sports host, Hard Factor News, here's his tweet Delta, small note for the suggestion box.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.160]   Maybe have a little warning sign or some way to prevent my laptop from being destroyed when the
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.920]   person in front of me reclines. There's literally when I open the laptop, the way I look at it is
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:51.040]   I look at the seat and I look at where it's going to catch. Yeah. And I and I look at it for when I
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.160]   tilt it just a little forward. So if it gets hit, it's going to go down. I've had this happen.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:01.120]   I've I've I crushed a 17. My last 17 has died because of this, right? Because the seat reclines
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.240]   with the trade table does not exactly. So this catches it. If it catches it. So that happened,
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.360]   actually, I was lucky. I yanked the thing out from under as it was going back. Had I not, I would
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:16.640]   have lost. That was the end of my 17 inch was this. This is this is this is why those those 360 degree
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.680]   screen hinges are such a godset. Every time I fly, I'm running into that problem myself, but it means
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.000]   that I can actually fold it the other way so that if someone does recline all the way back,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.200]   there's just no way for it to catch. It's it it it decreases the overall depth of the user experience.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.760]   And if I know that I'm going to have to work on the plane, I will just take a portable Bluetooth
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.000]   keyboard with me a little rechargeable with me. And it really is far, far more comfortable.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.120]   I like your reaction though, Lori, because that was exactly what I what I reaction. I look at this
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:50.880]   poor Macbook Pro. This I think it's the new 16 squished and that broken.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:53:00.320]   And I just can't imagine how sad I would be watching that happen. Like that like I would probably just
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:08.240]   Well, make a they make group for great. I had I had an airbag hit one of my my titanium was the end
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.640]   of my titanium was an airbag. And it made a great stunt computer. So I was a
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.840]   true you at least you got something you got something you can have fun with. You can bring this to Apple
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.640]   and get it repaired. I look at that. Can I have more information on this? And if an airbag
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.760]   what happened to get thrown into the face of somebody? No, it was me. No, so what happened?
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.800]   What happened? Okay, so you're not dead. Deverify. It was driving. The guy that was driving. I was in
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.600]   the passenger seat preparing a presentation. And the guy that was driving just bumped the person
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.880]   in front of them, not very hard. And the airbag popped out. It didn't. Evidently, I mean, it pushed
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:51.040]   it up against my chest and it shattered the screen. But otherwise it looked fine, which made it much
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.960]   more useful like a month later when I had to speak in front of much people. And I looked like I
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:02.320]   accidentally tripped and threw it 15 feet on stage, which I felt was necessary because it was a morning
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.120]   seminar morning session for two and a half hours on the second day is the worst time to get a
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.920]   session. So I felt like I need to wake up. Alex, you may want to run to the phone. I think we have a
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.640]   pay phone right outside because Google has just announced that they are canceling Google I/O.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:25.440]   At least the in person of part of Google I/O due to concerns. This is the email from Google due to
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.440]   concerns about the coronavirus and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC who and other
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:34.000]   health authorities. We've decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at the Shoreline
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.680]   Amphitheater. Those who purchase tickets will be fully refunded by March 13th. While registered
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:48.000]   guests this year will automatically be able to purchase an I/O 2021 pass. So I went to the Google
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.440]   I/O front page and it doesn't say that yet. But this according to 9 to 5 Google, this email has
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:59.680]   been sent out to attendees of Google I/O. Other people are reporting it too. I wonder how long before
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.800]   Apple makes something. As you point out, they don't need to say anything because they haven't sold
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.680]   any tickets. They can just announce it as a virtual event. They would just probably just
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.880]   announce it as a virtual event from start to finish. This also puts a lot of, yeah, exactly.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.760]   Also, this put not only is it prudent, but this puts a lot of pressure on Apple to simply say,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.840]   well, Google canceled, Microsoft canceled, Facebook canceled, but you decided that it was safe to go
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.200]   ahead. Okay, let's see how well and if there's blowback from that, they are going to have a
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:37.680]   blowback that will overshadow anything they announced in June. So it almost seems like if you had,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:44.080]   don't buy non-refundable tickets to, if you're in the habit of saying it's usually a couple of
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.920]   weeks, it's usually at the same time. I'm usually there for two weeks anyway. I'll buy tickets in
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.040]   advance. Yeah, don't buy tickets in advance. So the thing, well, I mean, a lot of people bought
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   their tickets last. That became the whole trick is double so expensive people bought a year early.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.560]   Because they were fairly confident what would happen. But this to me hurts us in some ways more
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:06.080]   than Apple or Google because Apple can fill Steve Jobs' theater with employees and have an
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   incredibly rousing, it won't be the same, but have an incredibly rousing product reveal event,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.800]   almost like a regular keynote. And they can FedEx outproduct, they can do all those things,
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.480]   but it was just so much more efficient for them to do like briefing after briefing,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.440]   especially with international press, because they have to bring international press to
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.840]   Cupertino, or they have to go on a road show. And both of those are very resource intensive,
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.160]   but at least if you're in Cupertino and everybody's there, you can talk to all, like last year at
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.000]   WWDC, we didn't just get to see the new privacy features. We got to talk to all the privacy
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.120]   engineers. It was a huge difference in the quality and depth of the information we got.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.280]   Right. Yeah, we benefited because we came back and you shared all that information on the show.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   And for developers, it's not just the sessions, because like there are people who beam those
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.840]   sessions almost real time now, it's amazing compared to waiting a year to split the labs.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.920]   Yeah, the labs when you go in and get design critiques and you get to talk to the guy who
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.840]   made the framework and he says, Oh, you're getting this bug because of this. And you're like,
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.760]   Oh, you just saved me a year. And Google does. I mean, the thing is, is that that can be done
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.600]   online. Google does office hours or whatever where they bring in the teams and they live stream
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.320]   for their developers and they talk through your talking to guys and they're, you know,
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.360]   showing you things and here's how to take here's how to develop. Yeah, I guess the theory you could
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:24.000]   do all of that. You can, you can do it for a lot more people at the same time than having a round
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.320]   table. Just a matter of building, you know, it's a matter of exercising tools that are already there
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.040]   and applying them to this. There's, you know, we, it's not, this is an opportunity to start to
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.280]   stop doing something that's crazy and do something that is actually just a hands-on area. Like,
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.400]   you'd have to mail out so many more products than you'd have to just put on a stand all
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.560]   everybody's milling around. You get though. I mean, honestly, I agree with you on the brief
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.560]   things. I agree with you and all that. But the hands-on, I mean, you get 20. You get the hands-on
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:54.240]   video immediately. Yeah. No, I understand. It's good for YouTube. But, but do you really get, I guess,
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.160]   I mean, you've now seen it. I don't know how important that is. Is it worth getting coronavirus?
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:07.440]   But the other thing is, you can also localize until we really shut everything down. You can also
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.440]   localize a lot of these things where you're doing an event where you might be doing in all the major
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.400]   cities and then you- Microsoft has done that. They've had satellite events. Yeah. I'm salty
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.920]   because Montreal's never a major city. No. You know, we've done a bunch of events because we've had
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.800]   clients that are worried about carbon footprint. You know, so we've done ones across four to six
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.960]   cities that are all tied together in the back end. And the speakers are coming from every different
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.400]   city. The people are on every different city. They're talking to each other. And it works. And no
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:38.000]   one had to travel. And again, this wasn't a pandemic issue. This was a climate issue. Yeah.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.920]   I want to go to Montreal and have a bagel. Well, last good. Oh, let's do it, Leo.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.680]   Yeah, I really do. And now that I know that you're practically in Vermont, the food, the food
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:52.080]   in Montreal, the food in Montreal is amazing. I love. I'm 45 minutes from Plattsburgh. Plattsburgh,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.760]   New York. Yeah. Wow. Home of the United States, Chefs Federation. Oh, Alex was here. What is it?
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   What is it? As an Afghan? I forget what we went to when you were here, Alex, but it was really good.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.280]   So good. I think it was Afghan, which I love. So good. I love Afghan food.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.880]   Yeah. All right. We're all going to Montreal because there's no food tour.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.200]   I can't get sick in Montreal, Kenya. I don't think so. You have to get sick in French.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:23.520]   Yeah, you can. My lad. I'm not going though. There's too much snow. Oh, come on.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:28.240]   There's always too much snow. Come on. No, no, no, no. I'm just concerned about being
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:32.160]   let back into the country. Do you guys have to go to where is future in Britain, right? Do you
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.240]   have to go to Britain every once in a while? So far, we've only had to go to New York. They
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.840]   have a New York office too. So that's fine. Actually, I still wouldn't even want to go there in the
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:48.320]   winter, though. I don't know. Let's go for you, Laurie. Oh, wow. New York's pretty pretty cool place
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   in the winter, I think. I like it better in the winter than the summer. I'm sure it's prettier
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.600]   in the winter than the summer. It's not devastating humidity and heat in the winter.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.520]   Yeah. I forget Alex, Laurie didn't move to the West Coast. She was born on the West Coast. It's
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.280]   very different. I have the sunshine boils through my blood.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   It's like Superman. Superwoman. She gets power from the yellow sun.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:20.160]   Did we hire you at Zipper Cruder? No, but we hired you. We did not.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.680]   I'm just thinking because we've used Zipper Cruder, our sponsor for this section, by the way.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.480]   We've used Zipper Cruder a number of times. Who else? Ashley, I think we got on Zipper Cruder.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.200]   Yep. John, Ashley, we have had such great results. You know, when you are hiring, it's always,
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.840]   if you're a small company like ours, it's always a problem because it means you're down a person.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.840]   Somebody's gone. That means everybody's working harder. Often the person doing the hiring is filling
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.520]   in. It's a pain. You want to hire the right person, but you also want to do it quickly. This is why I
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.760]   love Zipper Cruder. According to research by Zipper Cruder, 75% of employers these days are
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.840]   having difficulty filling open positions. That's why employers are taking bold steps to hire.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:09.920]   This is good news, by the way, if you're looking for a job. For example, 68% of employers have raised
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:17.440]   their wages. 23% have increased their benefits. That's how hard it is to hire unless you're using
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.720]   Zipper Cruder. Zipper Cruder, first of all, it sends your job posting to over 100 top jobs sites.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.680]   So you're going to reach, you're going to cast the widest net. That means, you know, let's assume
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.360]   the right person's out there somewhere, but you're going to go to wherever they are.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.840]   Here's another great thing they do. They have some really sophisticated matching technology.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.440]   People apply for jobs at Zipper Cruder too, right? It's a job site. They will scan through those
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.680]   resumes to find people with the right skills and experience for your job and then actively
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.440]   invite them to apply. You can even add screening questions to your job listing so you can filter
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.440]   candidates, focus on the best ones. You can multiple choice, true, false. You have essay questions
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.160]   and narrow it down. Plus Zipper Cruder, all of the applications come into the Zipper Cruder
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.000]   interface. They don't come to your mailbox, your inbox, your phone. They go right into the Zipper
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.800]   Cruder interface where they are pre-formatted so it's very easy for you to scan them, reject the
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.320]   people that just don't fit. Select the people that are just right for you. In fact, Zipper Cruder
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.520]   will even highlight the best applicants. It's so effective. Four out of five employers who post on
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.760]   Zipper Cruder get a quality candidate within the first day. Hiring's hard, more important than
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.000]   anything getting exactly the right person because you know it's harder than hiring, firing.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.360]   Right? Yeah. So higher right and then you don't have to fire. Higher right with Zipper
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.200]   Cruder, you are going to love this. The experience is great and you get great people. We love John
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.240]   and Ashley. We love you two miles, but we love John and Ashley. How do we find? He's John.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.320]   We got miles. How do we find you, John? Do we just throw a dart?
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.840]   Basically, I think a dart was just thrown around. My face was on there. You are good. I don't know.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.480]   Did you apply? Alex Lindsey may have had something. Oh, you set us up.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.040]   But okay, there you go. So that's by the way, if you don't have if you don't have Alex Lindsey,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:21.200]   you need Zipper Cruder. We have hired a lot of Alex's former employees. That has been a good
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.440]   resource. A lot of people have Zipper Cruder.com. Yeah, but you train him well.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.600]   Facebook's got a huge chunk. Yeah, that's right. Well, Facebook has one of ours too as a matter
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.680]   for you. Zipper Cruder.com/Macbreak. Try it free right now. If you go to that address,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.080]   by the way, that also helps us because then they'll say, oh, we got a lot of people from Mac break.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.320]   Zipper Cruder.com/Macbreak. Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:53.280]   Zipper Cruder.com/Macbreak. It's the smartest way to hire. And we know from real experience,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.640]   Miles and Ashley are just too excited. They're not the only ones we've used Zipper Cruder for.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.000]   Actually, I just can't remember all the rest.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:16.960]   So Apple has had a rule for more than a year that if you're a Chinese game developer,
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.680]   you have to have a license from the Chinese government for Apple to put you in the App Store.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.160]   But they hadn't been enforcing it, apparently. According to some publication called iMore,
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.120]   the Apple-- Those scallywags. Those scallywags over at a dime mall.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.000]   Dattering daybubs.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.160]   Apple tells Chinese game developers, no, you know what? You've got to get a license.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:46.000]   Yeah, believe it. There's the law in China, right? The administration
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.600]   oppressed some publication of China. That was just a law that they had in place,
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.480]   and that Apple hadn't been enforcing that for a while.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.680]   Do you think Apple kind of knowingly didn't enforce it? Let's see if they notice.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:06.400]   Could be? Could be. Maybe they were given a certain amount of time that they had to
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:13.040]   build the system in place to make sure that they were checking it.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:20.560]   Now that deadline has hit, now they have to do it, even if they were putting off making the switch.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.080]   The Chinese government really has locked down. I think they just passed a new law that says you
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.600]   can't say anything that would in any way scare people about coronavirus or disparage.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.920]   The regime. They're not the only government. They're just the only one who's doing it fairly open.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:39.200]   Yeah, they got a law. There was a report today about not being able to prep military troops or
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.320]   something because they didn't want people to actually know that we were taking it seriously.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:48.000]   The whole thing is gasping. That's too bad. They did block Plague Inc.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.960]   In the rest of the world, everybody's downloading it. The publishers of this great game, which has
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:01.120]   been around for a long time. I'm going to play this game. Say, this is just a game. It's not
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.760]   modeling the spread of any actual viruses. You're not going to learn anything from this.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:11.440]   Nevertheless, I noticed people are downloading it. They're also watching contagion. That's like
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:17.920]   the number one movie on iTunes now. You came out five or six years ago because we want to learn.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.120]   There was a good movie. It wasn't a great movie, but apparently science was really good.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.080]   Yeah, I thought it was an enjoyable movie. It was okay. It's good to watch at home.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.640]   It wasn't one to go out and see. There's often a trade-off between good science and entertaining
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:39.440]   fiction. The science fiction and the scary part is always like it's zombie plague or it's
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.960]   Ebola. It's like the ones that are very visually dynamic, but real life was always like,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.120]   "No, we're the flu. We're fine." It was all we need to continue to do. I think. Yeah, wasn't it?
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.400]   I don't remember, but it wasn't. That's where I learned what R not meant.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.160]   Right, exactly. Yeah. Well, also, it also made the point that you will never know how this
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.080]   absolute horrific pandemic started because it's a complex interaction between human species
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.360]   and non-human species. If we knew how to prevent it, we could prevent everything from happening.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.680]   The whole, "Don't touch your face. Wash your hands."
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   By the way, I know those safety things were in there.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.400]   Exactly as I started telling a story, I started touching my face.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.360]   I want somebody to make an iPhone app that honks at you.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.600]   Yeah. Yeah. You just put it... No, it would be your Apple Watch, an Apple Watch app that uses
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.080]   the location of your where your wrist is. Or just you put the camera on you. I don't know.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.640]   I can do it. Can you not do it? I don't know why you say you couldn't do it.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.400]   Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. I can... No, I know that's for real,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.120]   because it's hard not to touch your face. I was thinking about running some errands before the
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.160]   show. But I definitely have to do something after the show to drop off something for FedEx.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:54.320]   And I'm like, "Do I really want to have to wash my hands when I get back here before the show,
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.440]   and not to be able to touch my face for another hour? Or do I want to just do all those errands at
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.760]   once and have to do all the hand washing and all the non-face touching at once?"
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.240]   It's a navigation, man.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.320]   We, last week, we had the story that Apple was going to... that the Supreme Court rejected Apple's
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:20.320]   appeal, and Apple was going to have to pay a patent troll almost half a billion dollars.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.560]   Well, now Apple has to pay half a billion dollars to somebody else. Man.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.440]   Lots of other people.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.200]   If you have two hundred one billion dollars, pretty soon everybody comes after you.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.280]   Apple will be paying half a billion to end a lawsuit claiming it in... There's Tim.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.320]   I'm not happy about this.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:45.520]   I love when they take a picture that has nothing to do with the article.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.160]   Like he wasn't there looking at watching this.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.480]   This is some other picture.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.120]   This is another Congress.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.000]   They do it all the time.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.560]   It's just...
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.600]   Actually, this is Tim standing behind the president when he was announcing that he had just opened this factory in Texas.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.920]   Is he running for Congress?
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.280]   Is he doing the slow zoom?
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.720]   Tim Cook doesn't want you to buy an iPhone.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.400]   Tim Cook has got billions of dollars.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   What is he doing with it, Tim Cook?
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.720]   He says that he's going to business of the users.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.960]   Tim, this is a class action lawsuit.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.640]   Yes, so it would be a lot of people who'd be paying.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.840]   Saying Apple claimed... or that claimed Apple capped performance on older iPhones.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.440]   Well, it did.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.080]   We know that.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.280]   There's not been a secret about that.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.560]   It's really the intent that is in dispute.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.800]   The lawsuit said, because they wanted to force people to upgrade,
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.040]   Apple said it's because your crappy old battery is going to crash the phone if you try to do it.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.600]   It was brown out.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.840]   If it came with peak process demand, it would cause a brown out.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.640]   I believe Apple did that intentionally.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.400]   Nevertheless, the lawsuit is being settled.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.760]   It was disclosed on Friday.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:05.360]   $25 per iPhone and a minimum of $3 million, although it still needs to be approved by a judge.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.320]   The lawyers get $90 million and if you're a named member of the class action,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   you get 1,000, a couple thousand bucks or so.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.120]   And the rest of us get...
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.280]   What are they going to get checked from Apple?
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.720]   Well, when you see all these class actions, just remember that it's really just lawyers
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.680]   doing lawyer-y things.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.720]   $90 million.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.840]   This doesn't make a lot of money with you.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.560]   It doesn't make a lot of money.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.520]   It's not helping anything.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.360]   It's 1.25 days of Apple revenue.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.280]   So the one thing I hope we get from this though is that Apple eventually did...
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.480]   I think they did the right thing because I think it was better for people's iPhones
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.680]   not to shut down unintentionally, but they didn't do it in the right way.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.440]   They didn't fully explain what was happening.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.000]   And they did later, once all this Bruja came out,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.680]   they gave people a page that explained what their battery health was
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.280]   and the ability to opt out in between brownouts if they really wanted to.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.080]   And all of those things, if they had just done that upfront,
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.320]   would have completely obviated any of these.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.800]   And it was horrible.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.320]   And it was the first to fake conspiracy theories.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.080]   They also super discounted the cost of battery replacements,
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.240]   which was great for everybody.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.760]   Yeah, $29.11 million people last year, 2018, I guess, took advantage of that.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.680]   That's twice the normal or 10 times the normal.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.040]   And the reality is that Apple does...
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.280]   People say Apple's trying to force you to buy a new iPhone.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.080]   And Apple's actual plan is way more fiendish than that.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.240]   They don't want you to just buy another iPhone.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.400]   They want you to be so happy with your car and iPhone
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.600]   that you won't even consider a Samsung or anything else when you go to buy.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.640]   But then your old iPhone will still be good enough that you'll give it to,
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.480]   like a family member or sell it or trade it in so Apple can resell it,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.760]   thereby increasing the overall number of iPhones in the market.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.120]   Because if you remember the earnings report,
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.040]   they don't even talk about how many are sold anymore.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.520]   They talk about the absolute platform size now.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.800]   And any iPhone that times out of being still useful anymore
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.440]   gets dropped from the platform size, which is not what they want.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.800]   So they want those things to keep going in secondary and tertiary hands.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.280]   If you had an iPhone 6, 7 or an SE, you have to apply.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.880]   And then you could get as much as $25 depending.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.480]   It's the same thing we saw this.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.760]   I believe that's 6s though.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.640]   I think they have that wrong.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.280]   I think it's 6s.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:03.840]   6s.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.960]   Yeah, that's...
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.400]   This is business inside or so.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400]   They may have dropped something there.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.120]   So you'll get a note, you'll get something in the mail and you could fill it out.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.720]   Or maybe you'll have to go to a form online.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.600]   I got one for Quebec.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.960]   We had the similar lawsuit in Quebec.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.320]   And I was getting three bucks.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.920]   Here's where five bucks in the mail or something.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.280]   You filled it out?
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.960]   No, they just sent me the letter saying, "Hey, you're a resident of Quebec."
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.120]   You're part of this class action.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.160]   I'm getting you five bucks.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.960]   I wish they would just send us a coupon to the Apple store.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.080]   Oh, I'd use that.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.520]   Give me 10 bucks in the Apple store.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.480]   What can you buy for $5 at the Apple store, Alex?
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.000]   Especially you.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.960]   Alex can't buy.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.200]   Just count on something that you were going to buy anyway.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.520]   It's a 125th of an Alex.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.800]   Here's a 125th of an Alex.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.160]   I will find something.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.200]   Buy yourself something.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.400]   Have some mints.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.280]   Have some mints.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.600]   As an Apple store, it would probably be $10 from this.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.240]   The mints are probably like $6.95.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.360]   I'm a little disturbed by this.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.960]   We talked about it on iOS today and Micah and I were kind of disheartened.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.680]   This is a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.040]   Uighurs for sale.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.800]   I don't know who the Australian Strategic Policy Institute is,
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.800]   I don't know the facts on this.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.720]   But we know this.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.480]   The Muslim minority in China, the Uighur minority,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.800]   has been incarcerated by the millions in concentration camps.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.960]   The report says that many of them are then sent to
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.280]   get re-educated and then brought to factories under conditions,
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.480]   quote, that strongly suggest forced labor.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.120]   Factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands,
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.840]   including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony, and Volkswagen.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.080]   They say 80,000 Uighurs were transferred out of their homes in Xinjiang
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.240]   to work in factories between 2017 and 2019.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.400]   Some sent directly from detention camps.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.320]   Obviously, Tim Cook is going to make that face again when he sees this.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.240]   I think Apple has done a lot to improve conditions for workers
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.120]   in their primary assembly plants, the Foxconn plants and the Pegatron plants.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.760]   But these are mostly going to factories that are suppliers to Apple,
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.480]   suppliers of the OLED screens or the camera modules and things like that.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.640]   Your thoughts, Sandy?
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.720]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think Apple is to blame.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.320]   I don't think most of the companies that are being named are to blame.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.040]   It's part of how complicated the supply chain is.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:55.920]   And if you're going to have the hiring power and the commercial power of a company like Samsung,
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.880]   like Apple, Huawei, like anybody, you have to take responsibility for the fact
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.240]   that sometimes your suppliers are going to do things that you don't approve of.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.760]   And possibly, if they have to do some more work,
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.200]   part of that is going to have to be if we are negotiating for the best advantage we can
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.640]   possibly have in terms of bringing unit cost down, bring things in on the timeline that we demand
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.920]   and not on what they think that they can actually provide.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.720]   What are these contractors going to do in order to make sure that they can produce
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.800]   this component at the price we want and at the time frame that we want?
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.520]   It labor is such a complicated thing and there's so many knock-on effects that we are not going to
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.000]   figure out for the next 10 or 20 years. It really is like climate change. It's like a social version
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.600]   of climate change. We don't know that we fundamentally screwed up a thing that makes
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.360]   the global society work until we see all these weaknesses happen.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.400]   And this is the first crack in that scenario. We are seeing slave labor.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:03.440]   Again, we are no doubt about it. It is slave labor being used to produce components that are
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.000]   going into an iPhone. And again, not with the knowledge and not with the consent of Apple.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.320]   They are going to probably be beating a few managers about this. But nonetheless,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.400]   that's what happens when you drive costs as low as possible. The people who are going to get it
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.840]   right in the neck are usually the people who are doing the assembly, the people who are being paid
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.080]   an hourly wage. ASPI reached out to the 83 brands. By the way, all the big brands are in here,
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:36.480]   including many clothing and sneaker manufacturers, cars, all kinds of manufacturers.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.360]   And I asked about the suppliers. Some of the companies, for instance,
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.800]   Deedis Bosch of Panasonic said, "And I bet you Apple is in this boat too. We don't have any
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:53.200]   direct contractual relationships with those suppliers. Those suppliers make products that are then
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.640]   sent to other factories that we do have a relationship with." And I think that's been part of the
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:05.280]   problem with the supply chain is the batteries. A lot of these parts are made in questionable
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.600]   circumstances. But if you don't deal directly with those factories, then you don't have any
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.440]   leverage. It's such a complicated. It's very complicated. I mean, the thing is, it would be like,
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.280]   I just know that I've worked with a bunch of these companies. I have to sign all kinds of,
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.840]   if I'm working for a large corporation, I have to sign all kinds of agreements.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.440]   Well, you do use forced labor. I know. That's why we hired a lot of those people.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.560]   Right, John? But the thing is, is when we're hiring freelancers, I have to do background checks on
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.400]   those folks. And you have, there's all these stacks, but it's like, at some point, I don't know
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.840]   what they did. I don't know what the person that they bought stuff from, that's being used.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.240]   This isn't like someone directly giving something to those Apple ones.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.480]   I do have to say, this is what happens when you say, and I think you write Andy,
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.880]   the price pressure, maybe drove them to it, we're going to manufacture in China.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.160]   If they were being manufactured in the US with US made parts, it would be done in prisons.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:10.560]   I may be like, I mean, who made your license plate, right? But, but, but, but, and of course,
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.800]   you're not suggesting an equivalency there, but you are right that that's, that's, that's
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.640]   not the thing that I am in the same ability.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.360]   The work that we outsourced to prisons in the United States is in the same room.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.320]   Oh, a lot of stuff. Maybe not sitting in this right next to them, but it's in the same room.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.720]   Yeah. Now there's a lot of stuff that's made in prisons, I know.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:35.200]   Yeah. I would, I would say though, Alex kind of drifting off of what you were talking about,
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.480]   that, you know, the difficulty of kind of, you can't, you can't know what every part is being
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:47.120]   made for your phone, for example, in this case. But I think that corporations do have the ability
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:53.760]   to put pressure on all the way down the supply chain of, especially after having the knowledge.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.560]   So before they had the knowledge of some, something forced, some forced labor happening
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.640]   down the supply chain, once they learn that. I think this report will, within a year,
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.120]   none of these guys are going to be using anything that's connected to that.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.280]   Yeah. I mean, it's, it's all going to go away.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.520]   If they can't, they will. There's a big, well, there's another big issue there in which
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.720]   this is the Chinese government that are rounding up Muslims, putting them into camps that they are
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.960]   claiming to be employment retraining camps, but are actually not only, it's reeducation,
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.440]   reeducation camps. And not only are they being then moved and forced into this labor situation,
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.720]   but also they are treated like third or fourth class citizens within that labor community,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.960]   where even then they're being monitored, they're being forbidden from practicing their religion,
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:45.200]   they're being, they're being suspected. This is not a, it's, it's, it really does raise, once again,
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:51.760]   that, that consistent drumbeat of what is going to be the cost of dealing with countries that treat
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:58.080]   their own people in deplorable ways. And there's never an easing answer to a lot of these things.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.240]   Well, yeah, yeah. But, but again, we're not rounding up people putting the, who are of a certain
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.080]   religion, putting them in camps and then force away from their families, stripping them to their
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.440]   identity. I watch the Canadian, I watch, I watch what's happening with Canada and the natives and
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.080]   with America and the borders. And I honestly don't know how far away we are from anything anymore.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.120]   Terribly, is really human what we're doing to each other. So scooter,
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:24.960]   we don't need to learn scooter. You accept me this link from the state of California since 1947,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:30.080]   inmates at Folsom State Prison have manufactured California's license plates for the Department
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.280]   of Motor Vehicles. Originally, the factory was located in a surplus airplane hangar near the
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.560]   original granite quarry. So now we know what else the inmates are doing. In 1953, the entire operation
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.720]   was dismantled and reassembled in the new factory located in the upper yard. The first license plates
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.000]   were made of steel. Today, license plates are manufactured from aluminium with reflective sheeting.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.960]   Over the years, license plates have undergone many changes. Blah, blah, blah. Through the
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.520]   water. It's not just license plates. No, it's a lot of stuff. Prisoners are doing all kinds of
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.040]   things. And he's right, I don't want to conflate the two, but I feel like we would have a much better
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.880]   moral platform with which to express our outrage if we weren't being just so terrible in our own
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:20.560]   ways. Well, my big issue is more with the shift towards privately owned prisons as opposed to it.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.960]   It's one thing when you have federal and state-owned prisons where a lot of the reasons why you have
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.160]   prisoners stamping out license plates is because it gives them something to do other than getting
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:38.480]   into severe forms of mischief. It basically gives them a certain, it's part of a rehabilitation
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.280]   training. It's when you have a private prison that is trying to be run for profit when the
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.960]   corporation that owns that prison sees that the prisoners as a labor unit that then can be rented
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:56.160]   out. And then you have them lobbying for certain get tough on crime incentives to make sure that
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:02.160]   those private prisons get filled with people who can do that contracted work. That's when you start
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:09.920]   to be like, oh, for F's sake, come on. What country are we in? Do we have a right to judge
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:18.240]   anybody on anything? If it's one thing, if a government is saying that a group is ideologically
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.680]   unsound for inclusion into the regular workforce and to be trusted members of our society,
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:30.800]   but it's not as bad, but it's certainly in the same sort of category when you basically say that
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:38.960]   corporations are allowed to withdraw human beings from the general population to be able to provide
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.320]   cheap labor at pay. Anyway, I'm about to get on a tear, so I'm going to stop. Yeah.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.400]   I got you, Andy. I feel like I voted. That's why I voted today.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:57.360]   That's all we get to do. 13.4 beta is out, nine to five Mac digging through the code.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:02.960]   Looks like they said they found evidence that Apple might be working on an internet recovery for
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:11.360]   iOS. Does this mean the end of the D F you? The end Leo or just the D F you on the cloud?
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.680]   D F you in the cloud. I'm going to sound like a broken record on this, but there was this huge
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.400]   rumor that Google was going to make up one of the pixel phones with no ports and they didn't end
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:27.280]   up doing it because they could not get remote execution 100% stable and it has to be. We've had
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:34.080]   quote unquote portless devices like the Apple Watch and the Apple TV don't have user accessible
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.240]   ports. You can break them open and dig around inside and get a USB port, but they're just not
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:42.800]   user accessible and you have to take them to an Apple store and they open up the sealed port and
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.440]   they plug into it, but it would make everyone's lives much easier whether we keep the port or not
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.800]   if you didn't have to go because like I don't think most of my family knows how to connect to
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:56.160]   iTunes or Finder now anymore. They're so used to living in the age of iCloud. It would make it so
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.960]   much easier that if any update went wrong instead of breaking a device and having to go find a way
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.480]   to plug it in, you could just do an internet recovery. It would just be one more step towards
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:12.320]   making these things really truly PC free. That's why when I did a ask the tech ion
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:18.400]   on the DFU, I sent people to your video at imore.com because the timing is so critical.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.880]   That you got to watch a video while you're pressing the button and doing the button and
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.960]   it's a dance. I wish you wanted to be because you don't want it to happen by accident.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:35.040]   My issue is that how many times have you had a problem with a device and you go into a Google
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.200]   search for how do I solve this problem and then you'll find a really beautifully produced
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.760]   support document on Apple or Google or whatever that explains. Here's how you do the reset and then
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.240]   wait for it to blink four times. That happens four times. Blink search again. It'll turn orange
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.880]   and go into recovery mode. But there's nothing in that document says, "Okay, let's say hypothetically
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.200]   that I do all that and the light never does turn orange. Are you going to tell me exactly what to
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:04.800]   do then?" There's no documentation for that. I've said this time and time again because this
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.040]   really is a core belief for me. If you're going to take away a feature from a device, you have to
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.680]   give the consumer something in return. You can't just do it because your designers are offended
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.520]   that there's a hole in this thing. You can't do it because, "Oh, well, it's inconvenient to have
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:26.000]   to design around having this other mechanical structure inside the device." I would be okay with it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.600]   I'm more okay with it on the Apple Watch where obviously you can't have a 30-pin port
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:39.200]   on this device. It's just crazy. I'm okay with it on the Apple TV because it really isn't a device
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.880]   where you do anything but simply plug it in, plug it into a TV and watch television.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.560]   And it's also cost about $200, $150. When you're charged, when you're giving me,
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.760]   when I'm giving you $800 for a phone, I really want to make sure that anything that I want to do
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.200]   with the phone. I don't care about what the majority of people do. I want to make sure that
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   what my possibilities aren't being limited by the fact that you made a selfish decision
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.520]   as a designer and decided that, "Well, people don't use ports anyway. We're going to simply delete it.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.400]   I'll be with you. I won't even notice it's gone until that first time where I'm totally,
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.080]   totally screwed, but I would have had an out if I had an actual place I could plug in a cable on this
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:28.160]   device." Which I think is exactly where this OS recovery is. It's sort of like the first step
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.680]   in into that world. And I actually don't think it's a good idea for Apple to use to make a
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.920]   portless phone. I'm on your side with that, Andy. But I think this evidence and the beta that there
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:46.880]   may be some kind of cloud-based recovery, this to me is an example of Apple testing the waters
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.640]   as to whether or not this is something they could implement because I don't think that they will
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:56.800]   get rid of the ports until they're sure that they can allow people at home to access
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.680]   recovery for their phone or DFI for their phone through the cloud. And it's seamless and smooth,
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.320]   and it works really well because that is so important to us before making those steps.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:14.640]   No, I agree completely. The other issue is always going to be just glossing over the fact that
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.240]   there are a lot of people that don't have easy access to an Apple store either because they're
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.680]   just simply isn't one nearby or because they don't have a car they can get into and drive to a mall.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:32.640]   But the other thing is that wireless, I think this is a line that I keep stealing from René,
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.840]   and I usually credit him. But because it coalesced a lot of things I already knew but failed to put
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.960]   into a simple phrase that wireless charging does not come for free, that you're going to have to
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.480]   deal with the fact that it causes heat, it causes stress on the battery, it's not typically as fast.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.960]   It's not as easy to take. Last night I charged my phone and once again I've had this phone for
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:02.080]   years but I was shocked to find out that I was at like zero at like you're about to go south.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.360]   This phone is about to go home to Jesus temporarily until if you don't plug it in soon. And then
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.880]   looked at it again 15 minutes later and it was up to 60% and like my god I love fast charging.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.560]   And I don't want to trade away the ability to fast charge it to basically just to by the time I
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.880]   finish the, by the time I, the tea that I ordered at Starbucks has gotten even slightly warm.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:30.320]   My phone is at 100% and I go home with my life. Again, show me, give me a reason why you removed
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:36.560]   that port and it can't be, we didn't like the slot in there, we didn't like the fact that we can't
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:42.000]   make, we couldn't put this component here because we haven't put in a lightning port or USB-C port.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.160]   That's just best with my philosophy. My hope is that, and again, one of the things is, sorry.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.720]   Go ahead. I was going to discuss, my, my, my feeling is that mechanical things are still failure
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.200]   points and hardware companies hate that. But if they can just mitigate it a little bit. So for
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.400]   example, like water resistance is fine. But if you plug immediately in after it's wet,
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.680]   you should never do that. That causes shorts or it causes corrosion. And also people, again,
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.440]   I don't think any of my family knows how to plug into iTunes and that becomes a whole stress
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.840]   thing and they've, they've got to find I'm more and thank goodness, you know,
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.680]   Lord is such a great job with all that stuff. They can find it and they can do it. But if they
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.760]   don't have to, if, if like the port is an option for them, even if it reduces usage by 50%, wear
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.480]   and tear by 50%, that's a huge savings. It means those ports will last longer. The phones will last
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.560]   longer. They'll be less errors. They can fast charge if they want to, but they have wireless
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.400]   if they need it. That's my, my favorite so far is because they didn't take away anything.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.960]   They just gave us the convenience of wireless charging. So like one day, I'm assuming everything
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.280]   will be gone, even the phone. It'll just be all virtual, whatever in our brains. But until then,
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.040]   like, just let us keep those things for as long as possible so that we get the convenience and
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:54.400]   can work our way off of the speed. There's also something to consider. Go ahead, Larry.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:30:01.040]   The fact that some people don't have computers in their house anymore. I've said this before,
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:05.680]   my mom is an example of this. She doesn't own a computer. She has an iPhone and an iPad,
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.480]   but she can't go into recovery mode if she needs to do something to either have her devices. She
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:17.280]   has to take it into an Apple store. So this is also helping people who have kind of transitioned
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.640]   out of computers entirely. And the better our mobile devices are, the more people aren't going
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.920]   to have full computers in their home. Excellent point. You could do it with a Mac now. That was
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.360]   one of the best things they ever did with a Mac. You could install the operating system from the
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.520]   Internet. You can zap the P-Ray. Yeah. And you can also zap the P-Ray. And that's where the frog
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:43.840]   absolutely has to leap out of the boiling water. I'm kind of, I will still say that I think that
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:49.120]   a phone with a headphone jack is better than one without one, but I accept that especially three
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   years later, no one has died because of this as far as I know. But the last level of dying,
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.480]   because they're no longer being strangled in their sleep because they went to say fell asleep and
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.840]   then they twisted it. Or how about the people who are trying to drive to emergency CPR, but like
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.600]   they're on the phone to 911, but then they get disconnected because of Bluetooth, but if they
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:14.160]   had a... There's also a legitimate problem that we're all have to use now battery powered
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.760]   AirPods or headphones that then end up in the landfill because you can't replace the battery in
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:26.160]   the AirPods. I don't know if that's a net gain. Yeah, I have phones work forever. Yeah, I have a lot
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:32.320]   of different options. Yeah, I have a lot of difficulty with the fact that these are, and this is not
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:40.240]   isolated to Apple. They're $250, $275, it's really positive everywhere. I have a big problem with
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:48.720]   personally spending $250, $275 on a device that has an absolute death date on it. Yeah, until
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.520]   until somebody figures out how to swap out these batteries and given how precisely these things
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.160]   are put together, as well as how so terrors these batteries are going to be, that's not going to be
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:02.480]   the case. We're trying to find, you got to be creative and think about people who can't afford
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:07.280]   it. That's fine, but for me, that is such a hard no that I can't imagine that's not a big deal
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.800]   for everybody else. We just have to figure out how to create artwork with it. I had a monitor,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.880]   I had a monitor that wasn't working, so I gave it to my son and he turned it into a lamp. Perfect.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   He came back and gave it to my wife for a birthday. I was like, he gave her a lamp. I was like, where did
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.280]   he get the lamp? But he's like, I made it from the monitor. A little earlier today, I fired up my
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:33.360]   ERO app during iOS today and lo and behold, your ERO now works with Apple HomeKit.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:40.720]   That's actually a big deal used to be if you wanted to put your IoT devices, if you wanted to
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.480]   secure the network from them because they often become a gateway for bad guys in your network,
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:52.720]   you had to use the Steve Gibson three routers system, which is impracticable to say the least,
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:59.920]   especially since now you can't reach your IoT devices. You can't use them. This is a really good
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:06.080]   solution, isolating home kit IoT devices on your ERO network. I imagine Apple is going to extend
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:12.000]   this to other networks at some point, but this is something now available right now in your ERO.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.440]   Leo, I have to ask you a question about this, especially because you were talking with Micah
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.800]   about it, and he's also a home kit expert and a smart home expert. What about the fact that
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:31.600]   you're supposed to reset all of your smart devices back into the home kit? That's the only reason
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.840]   I had it on it. We talked about this last week, didn't we? Did I not have a repeating the story?
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.280]   I am because. Nope. Nope. This is new. This is new. Okay. Because somebody else raised this wall
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.880]   that you have to read. We were talking about it because it was rumored to move forward.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:51.440]   And now it has. You do have to reset it. Is that what Apple is saying? Reset the devices?
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:58.880]   I think they're saying they recommend it. I haven't tried it yet because I don't want to find out
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:06.240]   that I have to go reset every single one of my home kit or smart home kit. What it does is it
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.280]   makes a firewall basically around every device and then opens just the ports that are necessary
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.960]   for that device to either communicate to the outside world. Although you can say if there's
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.560]   no reason for a device to connect to the outside world, you can't. Your local network only. But
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.480]   the firewall is great because it says this port only, this device only, and it prevents even a,
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.320]   I mean, I'm going to have to say it might be unnecessary because anything that's home kit
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.760]   is probably has over the air updates and is probably pretty secure by itself. It's the weird
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:41.600]   off brand Chinese cameras I'm more worried about and they're not home kit. But still, this is exactly
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.480]   the, in my opinion, the right thing to do. And going forward, it'll just be when you get a new
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.280]   home kit device, you just add it to network, right? So if you put it off like me, then you're
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.800]   good. Yeah, it does. It says, you have three, three levels of security restrict to home,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.760]   which means devices can interact only with home kit through your Apple devices, no access to the
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.960]   internet at all. The default option is automatic, which allows limited internet access to the home
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.240]   kit and connection, quote, connections recommended by its manufacturer. And then no restriction,
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:20.400]   it's just like it is already, which is that I think I would set my phasers to definitely restrict
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.960]   to home. Restrict to make it as reliable. Yeah, from external and right and killing people with
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.120]   some devices, though, you know, need to get the time from a time server and things like that. So
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.520]   you can't necessarily do that. I think this is a good thing to do. And I just saw that it is
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.040]   available now. When Mike mentioned it, I fired up my arrow app and there it is.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:44.160]   So if you've gotten the arrow and I presume other home kit routers will do the same thing at some
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:51.120]   point, take your pressures on now, right? Let's take a break and then shall we come back to
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.600]   our picks of the week. All right, we'll do that. I just want to reiterate what we said earlier,
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:06.240]   the WWT panel is now open to all. So please don't come a few sick, but open to all without sniffles.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:13.200]   No sniffles allowed. But if you go to w w t dot com slash twit dash live dash podcast,
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:20.320]   then we will let you in and you can join our live broadcast Alex Lindsay's on the panel.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.560]   Mary Jo Foley's on the panel. It's going to be a lot of fun. We've got an analyst from the
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:30.480]   Gartner group talking about the future of tech in the cloud. And there it is. There's all the
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.840]   people. And it's going to be a lot of fun. It's the meetup is tomorrow, Wednesday, March 4th,
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:44.480]   730 PM at the train wreck at Westport train wreck saloon at Westport. Are you going to be out in
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:49.200]   time tomorrow night? Okay, good. So come on over. And then the event is going to be a lot of,
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.240]   there we go to train wreck saloon. And the event's going to be online. I like the picture of me in
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.320]   a cowboy hat. We're going to have a lot of fun at that panel the following day Thursday.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:04.480]   All the details and you do need to RSVP if you want to know more twit.tv/blog,
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:12.640]   give you all the information. Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV. You are obviously
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.000]   a discriminating Apple user if you listen to this podcast. Maybe you have some interest in IT.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:25.040]   Maybe you already work in IT. IT Pro TV is the easy and fun way to get the IT skills you want to
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:32.400]   get your first job in IT or to get a better job or a more responsibility in your job in an IT
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.280]   professional. As a busy working professional, it can be difficult to get those skills or make
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:44.160]   a career change. IT Pro TV makes learning IT and getting those IT certifications easy. You can
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.480]   learn quickly at your own pace when your time allows IT Pro TV on your computer, on your mobile,
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:58.560]   on your Roku, your Apple TV. It's a great binge-worthy way to learn for IT professionals and people who
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:05.200]   want to be in the IT field. Content is current, relevant, up-to-date and it's, you know, I have
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.000]   to say it's entertaining. It's fun. They're really good. We were out there a couple of years ago when
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.240]   they opened up their new high-def studios in Florida, in Gainesville, Florida. Six of them.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:23.360]   That means they are putting out the videos. You're going to get the latest exam objectives for all
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:29.040]   of the different certs, including by the way, they are the official training partner, video
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.200]   training partner for CompTIA. They have 4,000 hours of IT training, but 12 CompTIA on-demand
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:40.160]   courses. So if you're studying for the A+ network plus or security plus certs, three of the most
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:46.160]   important certs, they've got all the material. It's official. What else? They have a certified
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:54.000]   ethical hacker. I love that one. The Microsoft certs, Cisco, security skills, Linux, MacOS,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.120]   Windows, AWS, all sorts of stuff. Even courses in business and some stuff that you'll need to
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.360]   know as everybody does when you get that new job, they always are up to date. They're always doing
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.200]   new stuff. You're going to love it. Don and Tim did a beautiful job creating IT Pro TV and
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:19.120]   it has grown like crazy. I got a special deal for you too. They have two plans. They have the basic
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.120]   plan, which gives you all the videos on-demand anytime you want. 4,000 hours worth. They also
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:31.600]   have a premium plan, which includes practice exams and Windows servers and clients that you can
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:40.880]   configure, mess up, and have fun with. Go to itpro.tv/macbreak. The offer code is Macbreak30

[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.200]   We always end with Alex Lindsay because this is the most expensive, but this time-
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:15.280]   It's not very expensive. It's potentially expensive. Oh crap. It's not expensive up front.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.080]   What is it Alex Lindsay? It's an interesting app. It's more of a-
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.640]   something I think we're going to see more of. I don't know if it's all there yet, but
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.200]   it's worth checking out. It's called Network or the Network. What these guys do is they have
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.000]   live streams and they drop new products and they do these little videos of the product.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.720]   Are you doing work for them? I'm not doing work for them.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:48.400]   But it's more of an interesting- Weird stuff. Is it the person who's making this device?
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:55.120]   Yeah, you can buy stuff. It's literally e-commerce with live stream.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.560]   It's hard to see on the web. It's like a home shopping network with-
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.760]   We're going to see more of this. It's less of a you should go look at it. You should go
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.160]   use it. It's more of a you should go look at it. There's 60,000 live streams being done
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:15.920]   to sell products in China. Not here, not on network. But the point is that this is a glimpse of the
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.760]   future of- I think that there is a- Where we're going to see more-
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:27.360]   You've always been saying that brands should do their own podcast, their own streams, their own
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.280]   videos. And what they do is they merge- Instead of buying ads on our fine network-
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.720]   No, they should still buy ads on your network to talk about their launch products.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:41.920]   Or they should pay you to do the launch product. So tomorrow there's going to be a G-Shock 25th
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.480]   anniversary. They'll show that stream at 5pm on their-
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.920]   On the cool. That you can watch on your phone, but the purchasing is right in the phone.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.800]   Of course it is. It's more for people who like to spend money.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.360]   People like me who do production, you just want to pay attention to this market because I think
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.880]   this market's going to be a really interesting market that's going to pick up speed.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.480]   So this is less of a recommendation of, "Oh, you should go use this all the time and go buy
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.520]   stuff because it could get expensive." It's more of a just worth researching this market
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.120]   because I think it's going to keep growing.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.560]   The youngs, you think the youngs, the kids, the eutes, that's who this is for?
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.800]   I think so. It feels like it is, doesn't it? Like it's- Are you a eute?
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.440]   I don't know. I don't know necessarily this is the end of it.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.600]   We don't pay you well enough to visit. This is the first one I've seen.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.240]   This is the first one that I've seen with purchasing really well put it-
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.640]   I really want this. What is this? What is this?
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.960]   It's like a skeleton that he had face. You'll get to know on March 6th.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.400]   We're on English collectibles.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.120]   Birthday present for the over.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.480]   Birthday present.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.080]   But I think that- Again, I'm just interested in it from a perspective of-
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.080]   Clearly aimed at younger people.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:01.600]   And you're right, it might be the future.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.680]   Young people have no taste.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:09.440]   No, again, don't look at the stuff that's there.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.120]   Think about that all of the products.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:11.680]   It could be anything.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.640]   This could be talked video-
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.680]   I just have everyone like young people.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.200]   People don't like ads to begin with.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.040]   Why would they watch a stream that's all ad?
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.240]   Okay, but it might be-
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.840]   We watch the Apple streams, don't we?
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.920]   We watch the Apple streams because we're interested in those products.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:25.440]   Or if Blackmagic is releasing a new camera,
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.160]   people would love to have a live stream where someone's like,
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.000]   "Let's show you the camera. Let's show you the camera.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.480]   Let's talk about that and have experts talking about it."
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   Now, that's not what this is doing necessarily right now,
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.880]   but I think that when people launch new products-
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.280]   No, I agree with you.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.440]   There's a lot of people who are interested in that product.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:46.000]   And right now, I was configuring a clear-com device.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.440]   And it was like, there's no documentation for the best parts of it.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.080]   No, but people under 30 go to YouTube immediately.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.600]   If they have a question, they don't read a manual.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.720]   They search-
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.280]   I go to YouTube and everybody else.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.640]   Like, I go to YouTube and then I-
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.320]   It's not there.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.200]   I'm like, "Oh, man."
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.840]   So here's Jonah Hill plus Adidas.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.560]   Jonah's going to do a stream and show off his sneaks.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.480]   I'm sorry, what do they call them?
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.360]   They don't call them sneaks.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.640]   I'm just trying to keep you up with the kids.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.000]   You know, just May the 4th.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.800]   A very special stream on May the 4th.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:23.120]   There you go.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:28.080]   I still can't see that bloody hand print on the stormtrooper
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.320]   and call that nothing Wilson from Castaway.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.600]   I thought that was a bad choice in the first place.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.640]   Or was it on purpose?
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.400]   Ooh.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.360]   Trying to lure Tom Hanks into the franchise?
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.560]   That would be wise.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.480]   Are they locking someone in or locking us out?
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.680]   You just blew my mind right away.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:46.720]   Laurie Gill.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.040]   He shocked.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:47.360]   That was right.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.160]   Your pick of the week.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.280]   What am I buying this week?
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.680]   Actually, you're not buying anything except for maybe some food.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:56.400]   So-
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.120]   I love food.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.480]   I just-
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.920]   I know there's going to be a lot of people who said,
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.120]   "This has been around forever.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.400]   You're so behind the times."
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.760]   But I just discovered-
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.120]   Laurie, it's been around forever.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.240]   You're behind the times.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:08.720]   Yes.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:09.680]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.880]   But I just discovered it.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.400]   So, binging with Babish.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.200]   Who's Babish?
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.400]   I'm so new to this that I'm not sure what his history is in the culinary world.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:21.600]   Oh, you know what?
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.200]   I recognize those tattoos.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.200]   My son watches this.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.000]   Okay.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:36.960]   So, it's a really just nicely put together YouTube channel.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:40.240]   And it has recipes for things.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:40.720]   For foods.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:41.920]   For foods.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:49.920]   But what is so cool to me is that he uses foods that are referenced or eaten in other
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.600]   movies.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.920]   Here's like the egg sandwich from Birds of Prey.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.800]   Right.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.440]   And the one that caught Maya was Ramadan from Paris.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.560]   Oh my gosh.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.600]   I wanted to make this.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.160]   I didn't know what that was.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.520]   I'm watching the movie.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:02.800]   She's saying, "Get some steak.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.240]   Make me Ramadan."
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:05.360]   And I'm going, "What is that?
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:05.840]   I want it."
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.920]   So, here's how you make it.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.320]   And he-
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:08.800]   Yes.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:14.000]   And he- not only does he make it with the- in this particular episode,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.560]   he makes it with the store-bought prepackaged stuff.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.920]   He also makes his own version from scratch with very ingredients.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.080]   Because you hear the differences between the two.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.360]   I know why you're instant ramen.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.560]   I want to make the real deal.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   So, it's really cool.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:31.280]   And I've only just started getting into watching his stuff.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.240]   But I've just been really impressed with delicious food making techniques.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.080]   And I don't cook at home or anything.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:41.280]   I just like to watch videos of people cooking for the soup.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.120]   How come he can play parasite on his YouTube channel?
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.720]   And I can't even play his YouTube channel playing parasite.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.720]   What's the deal, man?
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.320]   He paid the money.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.840]   You think he paid parasite?
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.720]   I don't know.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:54.880]   No.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:02.080]   Four million views in one month, less than a month, in two weeks-
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.040]   Yeah, he's a big channel.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.320]   On Binging With Babish,
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.240]   Ramadan from parasite, four million views, lots of people making Ramadan.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.040]   I'm not making anything with an ingredient called chapageti.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:18.240]   Good.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.440]   This is a good pick.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.240]   I'm going to try this.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:20.880]   This looks good.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.040]   I don't know why he doesn't get the apron sponsored.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.480]   It's a killer sponsor spot right there.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.800]   Well, I'm sure no one's paid yet.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.160]   But he's working on it.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.200]   I'm sure he's working on it.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.000]   There's a big Mac.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]   I don't know what a big Mac is going to say for it.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.640]   I don't know why he's explaining the movie parasite by the way.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.120]   Yes.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   Black truffles, just like in Bob's Burgers.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:39.360]   Sorry.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:45.760]   He's explaining the juxtaposition of cheap food with really fancy ingredients on top of it.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.800]   He just put 150 dollars with the truffles on a three dollar big Mac.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.680]   Right.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.080]   Yes.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:50.800]   Delicious.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:51.360]   And I think-
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.320]   And he ruined the big Mac.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.160]   Ruin the big Mac.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.760]   All right.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.800]   Cool, Babish.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.040]   Do you ever see his face or you just see his tats?
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:47:59.680]   You do.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.920]   Usually what happens at the very end of the episode, he leans down and takes a bite of the food.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.240]   And then you kind of see him leaning down and eating.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:10.080]   So you do get to see his face, but almost always it's from the chest down.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.040]   This is Henry's hero.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.960]   This is who Henry, my son wants to be.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.000]   And like on Brooklyn Nine Nine, you save a few of the Ramen Noodles crunchy
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.840]   and you put them on the top afterwards.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.320]   Oh, really?
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.360]   It's a little bit great.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:20.640]   Is that a special thing?
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.680]   No, that's a joke from Brooklyn Nine Nine when the character got sent to prison
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.240]   and he made his fame and prison by recommending that they keep some dried Ramen Noodles to crush on top.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.080]   And at first they were angry that an interloper would dare tell them how to eat their Ramen
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.320]   but then they tried it and it was delicious and he got his prison crack.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.120]   So good.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.680]   Of course, it's lunchtime, but I'm just saying this looks so good.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.000]   Yeah, it does.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.320]   And this is the one with the prepackaged stuff.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.960]   So if you go toward the end and you see him, he makes the noodles from scratch.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.200]   He makes the broth.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.960]   This is ready in 10 minutes.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.000]   That looks pretty good.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.160]   It looks exactly like the one in Parasite, by the way.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:58.560]   Right.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.760]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.120]   Your pick of the week.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.880]   So first I'll say if you like him, there's also a channel called Pickup Limes with an M.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.160]   That's a Canadian vegan nutritionist living in the Netherlands who does very similar
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.120]   but very healthy, trendy sort of good food.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.080]   So you can check that out too.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:20.160]   My pick is an app called TOT from a little company called the Icon Factory.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.160]   I was wondering if anybody would pick this.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.920]   Maybe you've heard of Craig Hockenberry and Gedmeja.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.480]   I don't know.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.680]   You know, they've been around a little while.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.560]   Or some guy named.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.360]   They're young.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.960]   Some kid named Gruber.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.560]   Well, he tested it, but it's really interesting.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.800]   It's not a full on notes app and it's not meant to be.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.480]   It's and it's not a clipboard, a multi-level clipboard manager.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:45.760]   It's something that just lets you record seven bits of random text that you want to record.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.520]   It's a single string interface.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:50.320]   You've got different colors to identify the different tabs.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.080]   You swipe between them and you just put down any text that you want to save.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.680]   Something that's not important to you enough to be a note that you want to keep, you know,
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.800]   virtually forever.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.800]   But something that you don't want to forget about either.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.640]   It's like a little scratch pad.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.840]   And the business model is so interesting.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.440]   The Mac app is absolutely free.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.880]   You can download it and you can run it on your Mac for free.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.160]   But if you want the companion iOS app, which runs on iPhone and iPad,
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:14.960]   is 20 bucks.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.320]   Which is a lot for an iOS app.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.600]   Five bucks a note.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.720]   It totally is.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.680]   But again, like the Mac app, which is what they really wanted to make,
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.560]   is free.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.400]   And they weren't, you know, the iOS app is going to take them a lot more to support it.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:33.200]   And it wasn't really their first in-line use case.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.760]   But they said, if anybody actually wants it, it's available.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.000]   It's just it's 20 bucks, no subscription, no upsell, no anything else.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.040]   Just a one-time 20 buck fee and you can have your notes lickety split synced everywhere.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:52.800]   So let's see how the people react to that when they complain so hard that they don't want to
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:53.920]   pay for subscriptions.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.800]   Well, here you go.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.240]   Are you going to buy this $20 app?
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.080]   Yeah, I got a prediction.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:58.960]   No.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.080]   You know what I would suggest?
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.160]   This would be a good programming exercise.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.680]   You could write this on a weekend.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.040]   You'd learn a little bit.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.720]   You'd have it just the way you wanted.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.840]   It seems like a trivial app.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.800]   The concept is trivial.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.000]   Like everything is the execution.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.040]   Like it's all of it's talking very immediate and the icon fact,
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:24.400]   feasibility to make it not just a thing, but like a beautiful thing that you're paying for.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.040]   Yeah, that's pretty.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.480]   Very pretty.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.240]   I was curious.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:31.600]   You know, I meant to talk about this because I thought this is the strangest thing ever because
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.560]   it what is it?
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.120]   It's literally four different notes.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:35.520]   That's it.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:38.160]   It's I think it's seven to seven.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:38.560]   Okay.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:39.840]   Yeah, one of these comments.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.480]   Oh, yeah, seven.
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.680]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.480]   I see it.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.760]   So it's seven notes.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.800]   Like you already have Apple notes, which is unlimited.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.640]   You already could do Google keep for free.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.920]   But see, these don't just grow.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.840]   Like you don't write something down and they never look at it again.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.920]   And now you have 30,000 things and you'll see this is the benefit.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:54.480]   This is the benefit.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:54.720]   You want to add it.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:55.200]   You want to add it.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.960]   You want to sacrifice a previous one.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.240]   Well, no, it's like if you want to add something new,
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.760]   you've got to sacrifice something else.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:03.600]   You never have more than seven pages.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.280]   Okay.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.480]   20 bucks.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:12.080]   I always said I would pay cultured code so much more for an app called
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:15.440]   Thing that only let me have one thing to manage.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.480]   One thing.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.200]   Or like a omni focus would use machine learning to
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:22.000]   suddenly drop out the things that knows I'm never going to do.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.280]   Like just save me the mental hassle of admitting defeat every day.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.680]   And just like when they never does this, we're going to drop this to use.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.640]   It's a little better about himself.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.280]   It has to use machine learning to look at what you constantly say you're going to do
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.400]   and never do and then just quietly have it disappear.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:37.120]   But it can't disappear.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.400]   Like it can't do a flash.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.920]   It just takes it out.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:41.200]   Like you just put it in there.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.360]   So by the next day, it's just going to.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.840]   So Alex, I think that would be fine.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.520]   Alex, you've accidentally created a brilliant idea for a productivity app
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.480]   where all of your projects are like Tamagotchi that they need.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.640]   If they don't do anything, they don't pay attention to them.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.520]   They die.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.840]   And you can't know better than that.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   Call them footprints in the sand.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.120]   But what happens is that if you don't if you don't tend to them,
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.200]   if you ignore them for a while, they don't die.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:11.440]   What the app does is it encrypts it with an encryption key that you can't access
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.280]   until you donate $50 to a charity that you've already designated.
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.880]   I just think they disappear and then if you don't really look for them for a while,
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:19.600]   then they die.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.280]   Then they just they just say, "Are you going to buy this?"
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.400]   This?
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.160]   No, I use Apple Notes.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.000]   My whole life is a wrap.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.280]   I'm really curious how this could do.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:27.760]   I don't.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.840]   This could be the beginning of a whole range of intentionally Spartan apps.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:39.520]   This is exactly the sort of app that I love to support where it is definitely not going to
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.000]   become a meme in culture anywhere.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.400]   It is a weird idea that a few people got so captivated by that they had to wish it,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:53.120]   they had to build it into reality rather than just let it go back to the land of ghosts and
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:53.920]   wins.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:57.200]   And it's this sort of app where most people are going to be like, "Huh?"
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.720]   But there are going to be a few people that, "Oh my God, this changed my life."
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.240]   I'm naming not a baby but certainly my first kitten after your product.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.800]   I definitely respect constrained resources.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.840]   I think part of what I love about Twitter is that it's an art form.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.320]   It's true.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.880]   That's why the Son is a great poetic form.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.600]   If you watch my tweets, most of them are almost like there's like 79 characters.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.440]   Yeah, they're always like in a, because I write them in there about 300.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.640]   Then I cut things out and I move things around and I restate things and I get rid of my passive
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.160]   verbs and I do all the things that you need to do to get down.
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:36.960]   And I like that process.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.480]   I get the constraints.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.000]   I get the constraints.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.680]   But I just do so many notes.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.960]   I do so many notes per day.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.080]   So I've been using--
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.600]   And I love to make this a pick.
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.000]   I wasn't going to make this a pick but I've been using something called Notion.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.040]   Are you familiar with Notion?
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:49.200]   Yes.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:51.120]   I love Notion.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.080]   So this is the exact opposite of TOT.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.880]   This is kind of an endless notebook for anything that you want.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.960]   What's cool about it is that any note can be shared.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.880]   It can become a web page, a public web page or a private web page.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.280]   That there's graphics, there's images it uses, markdown.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.800]   I think it's beautiful but it's completely free form.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.480]   In fact, it's a little challenging because at first you open it up and I don't know.
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.120]   What does it do?
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:21.920]   I don't understand.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.480]   It's more--
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.920]   I felt like it was more like a development platform for personal productivity.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:32.000]   Meaning that once you get-- if after four or five or six months of developing this thing for your
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.360]   job or your needs, you'd get something that is absolutely custom tailored.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.800]   But out of the box, it's going to be a bit of a slog.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.160]   But when you see it, but I agree, once you see what other people have done with it,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.920]   you're like, I want to make that slog.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.480]   I want to-- Andion, not go focus productivity out.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.520]   I have-- I've been started using this a few weeks ago and it's become my absolute number one.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:53.360]   I just keep it running.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.280]   It has an app for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows.
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:58.400]   It's a web interface.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.000]   You continue to show it, would you, John?
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.440]   It's got a web interface.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.560]   This is my Mac OS setup.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:12.800]   So what's nice about this, when I get a new machine, I can immediately open this in the web
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:19.440]   because I know I memorize the password and I can set up the new machine with all of the commands
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.480]   and everything that I need. I have to say, this is incredibly useful.
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.520]   When I went car shopping, I put all the things that I needed in a car.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.160]   This is so easy to do.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.360]   I don't know, I'm really a fan.
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:38.320]   Now it's free for a thousand blocks.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:43.360]   Here I've put together my COVID-19 pages with instructions on how to wash your hands.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:49.440]   Prep for the coronavirus. You can put web pages in here.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.920]   You can put tweets. You can put maps.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:01.120]   I feel like this is the exact opposite of TOT and I think it's actually insanely useful.
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.880]   There we got two picks.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.240]   One for the minimalist, one for the maximalist.
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:08.400]   Can I just jump in?
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:14.320]   I just installed TOT on my Mac just now and I immediately know that I'm going to be using it a lot.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:17.600]   It puts a menu bar icon for you, which I love.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.840]   I just need to sometimes just like, oh, I've got to remember to call somebody later.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.200]   I'll pop that in there.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.800]   Maybe it's also something that I want to plan out what I'm going to do for work for the next week,
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.400]   but I don't need to open notes for it.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.480]   I just need to do something really quickly.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.040]   So yeah, it's going to be useful for me for sure.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:40.400]   Just for no other reason than it's got a menu bar icon that lets me just jump in and look at it really quickly.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.040]   I'm like clicking those as opposed to a notebook.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.000]   See, I like wikis and this is more like a wiki where you could just keep on going and keep
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.360]   and put more on.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.040]   It's not Adobe Framemaker.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.080]   It's Pages Leo.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.680]   There's room in between both.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.640]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:57.600]   And to each other.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.920]   One for documenting battleships, the others are making a school newsletter.
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.000]   Maximalist versus minimalist.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.760]   That's the idea here.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.720]   So yeah, Andy and Aco, your pick of the week.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.440]   My pick is something that I've been looking for for about five years
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:15.360]   and specifically thinking hard about for the past four months before pulling the trigger.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.800]   Because it was kind of spending for me.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:22.320]   But this is, it is the Filson medium field bag.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.640]   I've been looking for years.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.840]   For for years to get a bite for life type of like everyday carry sort of bag.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.480]   Something that was better than the nylon bags that I usually get that I wear out after two or three years.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.160]   But wouldn't be so.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.440]   Oh, this is made out of 100% ox blood leather.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.520]   And just not being practical.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:46.000]   It really took me a long time to find one that had all the earmarks that I liked.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000]   Meaning built really, really well.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.600]   Also really, really classy has a lifetime warranty.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.120]   Also lifetime repair for things that fall outside of the warranty.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:00.320]   But also fit everything that I need or I want this sort of everyday carry bag to be.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.000]   And I'm talking about the carry on bag that you stick under your seat.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.960]   Not the not the roll away you put over the seat.
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:08.000]   Yeah, it's really.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.240]   It's 350 bucks. So it's a little bit spendy.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.600]   But it's it's a very, very thick thick twill like a canvas.
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.600]   It's reinforced at the bottom.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.160]   Really nice leather for all the fittings of all the all the fixtures.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.960]   Really, really nice like leather strap.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.960]   All the fixtures are real brass.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:30.880]   They're not some sort of like weird cheap pot metal or something like that.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.600]   But what I really like about it is that it might not it also has a care needed for me.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.080]   It needed to have a carrying handle at the top.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:43.680]   So that if you're just like grabbing something from from the concierge at the hotel or you need
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.840]   something just to fix it to the top you roll away.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:50.160]   Now I'm not saying this is necessarily the best bag for everybody.
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.120]   This is just the best.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.600]   But this had all the features that I liked out of every previous bag that I've been using for the
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.040]   past five or six years.
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.800]   I'll just walk you through a few of them.
[01:59:58.800 --> 01:59:59.920]   Like I need to have.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:01.360]   I like that.
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.680]   I like the kind of thing that has what's called a weather.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.240]   Weather flap on the top for a couple of reasons.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:13.040]   One of which being that often if oftentimes but not always the the straps that hold it down
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:17.440]   will have like a little bit of like a like a bulge here.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.320]   So if you have an umbrella or tripod you can stick it up there.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.800]   The other nice thing about having the storm flap is that if you're kind of in a casual situation
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.120]   you can just leave the flap open like I did and keep growing into it.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.120]   And like spring is coming.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.160]   And so you dress in layers.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.240]   So I will have like my jacket and the jacket you can just simply you don't have to even
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.360]   stuff it inside the bag.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:44.000]   You can just lay it across this put the flap over it and then carry it around that way.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.960]   It has to have a magazine flap at the back for first order retrievability usually of things
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.800]   like my iPad or things that I'm reading.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:58.880]   I really like to have these little pockets on the edges like one for my water bottle.
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.960]   Usually the other one has my super high capacity recharging battery.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.800]   The other thing another thing is kind of controversial.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.720]   I'm from a number of people I know.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:13.680]   I don't like bags that have lots and lots of dividers and little pockets inside them.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.360]   Because I know very briefly.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.960]   I just don't have stuff that fits into those pockets specifically.
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:25.840]   So what I prefer to do is just like sort my own gear into little bundles like this.
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:32.720]   It's big enough to hold really any 13 inch and maybe 14 inch laptops.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.640]   The only like this is my 13 inch MacBook that I usually keep in this kind of a sleeve.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.080]   One thing that's kind of a warning sign for certain people.
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.600]   I like this I should say.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.120]   It's actually has like sort of a seam that makes the top of it narrower.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.080]   So if you have a larger laptop you might have to sort of put one in first and then the other
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.880]   and as opposed to sliding it all the way down.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:01.680]   I like that because when you have to flap in it protects the contents from the rain
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.400]   and also protects it from fingers just being able to jump in for people behind you on the subway
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.600]   and grab things.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.240]   But again a lot of people are going to want organizations that's fine.
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:18.160]   It only has as far as pockets go it only has two but they are big pockets.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:26.480]   And if you want to know how big they are it is actually big enough to carry not only what is he
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.760]   having his pockets is not only my Sony disc man.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:30.720]   Oh wow.
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:33.440]   But the same pocket also has visitor from 19.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:36.240]   It also has also has four CDs.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:36.800]   CDs!
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.160]   So that's how let's see they're not they're not chintzy little pockets.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.760]   If you pull vinyl out of there and not come we're going to have words.
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:46.080]   You could fit an LP in here.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.080]   Now I should.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.400]   So like I said it's not cheap it's 350 bucks available in two colors.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.480]   You can get a smaller version of this if you're just using it with an iPad and that costs a little
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.040]   bit less.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.680]   If you sign up for the newsletter you can get 10% off immediately and that's what I
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:03.360]   that's why I would I engage with.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.240]   Their policy is once again if if anything ever goes wrong with it because of defect like if they
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.800]   didn't close the stitch where the properly and something pops off send it to them they'll fix
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.360]   it for free if just wear and tear happens they will charge you for it but they've been around
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.920]   for about a hundred years and they will I like the idea of 15 years from now having like patches
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.480]   on this thing and I've seen videos of people who've had them for 10 years showing off after 10
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.560]   years they look very nice beaten in and positive.
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:36.320]   I will give one little warning though and this kind of I had to navigate this to now 350 bucks.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.840]   I tried to say that I'm frugal rather than cheap so this is why it took me four months after
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:46.160]   discovering this to really decide if this is absolutely going to be the thing that was going
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.880]   to work for me despite the fact that there is a 30 day return policy so you can thaw us it's in
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:54.480]   resaleable condition you can buy it check it out with your own stuff in your office and then send
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.040]   it back you don't like it but now there is a weird a weird and suspicious thing.
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:05.440]   Filson if you go to this if you live in Seattle they have a Filson Filson factory store
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:11.760]   where you can buy seconds really cheap that's fine but if you look online if you go to eBay
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:17.600]   you will find lots of sellers that have this same bag for 250 dollars and it's not as though
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.840]   in their brand new with tags they say and it's they say that oh well and it's not like a limited
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.920]   number where they only have to know they seem to have as much as you can possibly get and I for
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.960]   the life of me cannot figure out any answer to how are they able to get an unlimited supply of these
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.240]   bags for 100 these very very famous bags for 100 dollars off retail unless they were absolutely
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:43.360]   counterfeit and so that's and I'm pretty sure that they there are a lot of counterfeit bags
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.800]   over there because I've seen like online reviews I said oh well the this this this this so-called
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.840]   brass handle like broke off after about a month or this this stitching came undone like almost
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:58.800]   immediately and also most suspiciously this is why it was so cautious that oh it won't I can't
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:04.320]   get my 13 inch MacBook Pro in here and it's like wait a minute I act I didn't actually buy it until
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:11.280]   I went to the Boston store locally you can get a Mac Pro in there Macbook Pro my my 15 my 15 inch
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:17.200]   MacBook Pro inside oh my goodness slip case works fine that's my that's neither than I thought it was
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:23.360]   that's not yes so and again if this were packed to the absolute gills I think I would have problems
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:28.080]   getting it out because once again there is sort of like a lip that kind of would have to make it
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:34.320]   shimmy out but so I would say make sure you're buying it directly from Filson because that was
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:38.960]   the big warning sign when people I was concerned that oh gee if it doesn't fit my MacBook Pro I
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:43.280]   don't always leave the house with the MacBook it really is more about the iPad but that would be
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:47.440]   kind of a deal breaker so that's why I actually made a trip I filled my backpack with all the
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:54.400]   stuff they would I would even even potentially carry in an everyday with carry bag and what it
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:58.560]   actually took to the store for a test fitting and it all fit just great so I think that there are
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:03.120]   knockoffs that are a little bit too small oh the one last feature that I really like and again these
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.880]   are things that I'd have to I have to abuse these things for a while before I realized this is what
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:13.040]   I like the bottom of this the bottom of the bag is wider than the top which means that when you are
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:17.200]   in that mode of I made I need to check out of this hotel I need to get out of here I need to get
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:23.200]   to write to the airport and you're just stuffing things in your bag the death of me is when I'm
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.880]   using a conventional bag where it's the same width from bottom to top so I'll get nice and
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:32.480]   stuff stuff stuff but then I can't close the top because I've overstuffed it the thing is when all
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:37.120]   the stuff is at the bottom and the narrow part is at the top you'll almost always be able to flip
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:41.040]   it over and actually seal it up anyway so I've had this for about a week now I've taken it out on a
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:46.560]   couple of different excursions really really really like it it's it's it has the hallmark of any for
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:52.240]   me for any like major purchase that I will definitely be worried oh my god am I really gonna spend 300
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.560]   dollars on a bag and then like the first time I actually use it I completely forget about how
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:01.200]   much I spent on it because it is right it's the right size the right functions the right features
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:06.560]   and and I think it looks damn nice and and I'm of the age where I'm going to enjoy having like the
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:11.840]   same bag my Ford prefect bag that I've been fantasizing about since I was 12 or 13 years old
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:16.000]   if I were going to be a stringer for the hijackers guide to the galaxy this is probably the bag that
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.960]   I'd have with me all the time oh you shouldn't this has not been a sponsored course I have a bag
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:33.200]   Jones as yeah many people know oh you should if you like that check out I've never heard of
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:38.320]   Filson before I've been looking at all their stuff man this is gorgeous since 1897 yeah and
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:43.440]   they have they have backpacks they have I know they have briefcases that I didn't like that some
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.880]   people are like oh I want something that has a zipper top that I could secure well they do have
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:50.560]   briefcases and other bags that have zipper tops to them I want something big enough that I could
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:55.120]   actually not only have my laptop in it but also have a couple days worth of like stuff for a trip
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:59.120]   they have also a small they have lots and lots of different stuff that's of that same thing they
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:05.760]   have only three or four stores nationwide there's a flagship store in New York for instance there's
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:12.240]   one at Boston tin cloth ah I believe it's like fine Corinthian leather that's that's the name that
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:19.520]   they came up with it's it's a I think it's a briefcase I don't know it's it's a see the thing is
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:26.160]   it's it's definitely stronger than nylon because my the fault of every bag that I've loved that I've
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:31.760]   bought for like 50 or 60 bucks has always been after a couple of years there will be something
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:37.680]   wearing through there'll be a hole somewhere usually on the bottom of it and so hopefully my
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:42.000]   I've experienced with with bags made of this kind of material that I've seen in vintage shops that are
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:47.200]   just like 50-60 years old this kind of heavy canvas tends to stand up and once again if even
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:52.000]   if I do wear a hole in it they will send it back with a very very slightly look at what it is
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.680]   it's a tightly woven canvas duck saturated with a liquefied paraffin wax and oil mixture under
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:03.920]   high heat and high pressure to protect against thorns and briars yes I'm not gonna be dragging
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:07.600]   my laptop back through a lot of thorns and briars but still it's good to know isn't it yes
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:17.200]   oh moly oh man I'm gonna just put this aside and tonight when I have free time I'm going to put on
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.240]   my jammies put a fire in the fireplace I'm trying to look away because I get a glass of brandy
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.960]   and brows notice me being very quiet I'm just trying to not look at all the wall and back
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.680]   oh my god I have a wall backpacks me too message your back and I've yet to find exactly
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:35.840]   exactly and they spin around and they present you with your bag of the day yeah yeah like giant
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:42.320]   the job is is that I have I have a lot of pockets and so going from one back to another is surgery
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:46.240]   like there's like a lot of right like well that's so I don't it's like a purse for a woman
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.240]   and so you don't want to immerse it's a merc this is my bag right now but it's not
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:56.480]   capacious enough to satisfy my needs but this is why this is why I put things into like little
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:01.600]   sub bags so that when I do switch from my bag back to this I can just grab here here's here all
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.840]   my cables and all my chargers for everything that I'm likely to put in this bag out for one
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:12.800]   into the other and he has bags have you exactly and he can ask if you ever held any other filson
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:20.880]   bags I have I have looked upon many filson bags in the store with lust I've had you finally gave
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:27.200]   into that lust you know what and it was a beautiful lovely thing I just right my it was my only shame
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:34.480]   yeah Alex I picture Alex having the briefcase from Iron Man 2 where he just puts it down and
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:39.680]   the the go-to live stream armor comes on I know the problem the hinges the hinges get
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:45.840]   stuck I am like set it down that it comes open part per way and then it doesn't come all the way
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:50.160]   and then you're in front of the client you're like I worked in the lab
