[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Well, never mind.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's time.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I speak in broken English.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's only my first language.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I am Leo Laport.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk about
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Mac and Tash Apple and all that jazz.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Andy Enoch goes here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Mr. Atatko.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   The man on the hat.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Catherine Hepburn there.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm very, very sorry.

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Aren't you wonderful to house this wonderful photograph?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Let's sock face.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   There's a fetish video that even the Japanese.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I think I need a minute.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You know, I kind of like that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I just had a vision there.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Also here, actually we should say that Andy is the only
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   regular who is here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Scott Bourne apparently is checked into an undisclosed
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   location in Florida where he has no bandwidth.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Mmm.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And Alex Lindsey is getting a sonogram with his wife,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Carlita, who is expecting their second.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yes.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So that's good news.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So the first sonogram is always fun.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Excellent.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You're just looking for how many legs?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so anyway, that's great.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But fortunately we have some wonderful people stepping in.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Mr. Frederick Van Johnson, who was going to be a regular,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   but I'll have to explain why he's not going to be going forward.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   This is Frederick's last appearance on Mac Spring.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   This is my last appearance.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   For now.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   For now.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, nothing is permanent.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   No, but you haven't always have a standing invitation to join us.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I may do the Kramer from now and just come here.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I bust open the door and show up.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Can you do that thing?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Can you do that thing?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I'll come up five minutes for my time.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You go in my hair out a little bit.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So the audience goes...
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And also here, then I'll explain what's going on with Frederick,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   but also here we want to get him as well from Liverpool,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Don McAllister of Screencasts Online.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Great to have you back, Don.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Always nice to be here.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Thank you so much for inviting me.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yay.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So we'll get to the stories in just a second,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   but I do want to say, I'm sad to say,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that Frederick got a job.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I did.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's kind of a...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You know, is that that whole member?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I think the last thing we were talking about when I got laid off from Adobe,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   we were talking about how, you know,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I was going to try to stretch the cash out as long as I could go.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And then...
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You're going to be a photographer.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Well, I still am.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I still am.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's still going 110%.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Good.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Good.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But in the interim and through it and everything, you know,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   there's a need to actually contribute to the gross natural product.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And your own national products.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And my mortgage company and, you know, benefits and then work with great people.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So I did.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I accepted a job with data robotics, also known as Drobo,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   the people that make that little device.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's one of them.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I have one of them here.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And Scott Borne has like 12 of.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Alex has a whole giant room full of them.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I'm thrilled because Drobo is a sponsor,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   but we have a policy for obvious reasons in the show
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that we only use journalists and we don't use marketing people.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Because we don't want the potential conflict of interest.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We don't want to run it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So every time, you know, Fredrick comes on,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   we don't want to have a Drobo commercial.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   But all of your stuff all of your stuff all of your stuff all of your stuff.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But they're still...
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Yeah, every time he...
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So...
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Why are you going to do that to me?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Why so...
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So it's just a policy here at Twit that we don't use vendors
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   or people who work for companies in general.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so I have to give you your pink slip.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I hate to do it because you're the greatest.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Again, look at that.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Get laid off from MacPray.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   But if you get fired again, you call us.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Hopefully no.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That could be a really good theme for this show.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Because we want you to continue to continue to continue to continue with this podcast.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You want to keep, you know, to keep being able to pay your mortgage.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So it'd be sort of like a hockey game where we're trying to get you to say stuff to get you to screw up this job.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Whereas you're trying to make sure that you still have a job to go to at the end of this show.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Nice perfect.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   A nice tug of war.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   There you go.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   There's a little tension here.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But it's all good.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And I will still be hosting this week in photography.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And that's fantastic.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   In fact, that show will probably come out of this studio at some point.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's starting someday when Alex figures out how to do it.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I actually think to maybe sit in that chair.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You could sit on the ball.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'm sitting in that chair, baby.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   There's a ball down there.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You thought there was a chair?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I remember one episode like long time ago you fell off of that thing.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It blew up.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It exploded.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm not even going there.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   There was something sharp on the floor.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.560]   And I had at the time, I hadn't yet learned the importance of buying no burst stability
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   balls.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.320]   I was just buying the regular yoga ball.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.400]   And the thing that the thing that I always insist on the no explosion gas tank on my
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   car.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.840]   The next or $20 in the sticker price, they will make you get the intermittent wipers
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.920]   to that part of the package.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   But it's worth it.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.640]   You wear the no break away pants.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   Everybody does.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   I foolishly didn't get the no burst ball.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.280]   And thing was like a balloon and hit the tack and went boom.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   Ouch.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.120]   And I was on the ground within half a second.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.800]   Was it on camera and everything?
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.880]   Well, somebody says it's on camera.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   I don't think there's video of it.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   But there's definitely audio.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   It was in the middle of a twit broadcast.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.520]   And there's a rather loud explosion.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   I heard it.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.960]   And then hilarity ensues because I've suddenly shrunk three feet.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.560]   But that's not a story for now.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.600]   I won't wear any sharp objects in my back pocket.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.680]   I hear stuff on a drone.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.520]   How come every time you talk, I hear that I hear that jingle?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   And I don't have my own little jingle yet.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.000]   Now I guess I do have one.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.840]   Oh, that's true.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   Because you were special guests.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   Your name here.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   Yep.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.080]   There was no Frederick van, but now there's true.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   You were.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   Yes.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.160]   Insert name here.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.360]   But now we just we have the name.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.200]   Anyway, let's let's move.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.840]   Let's move on to the stories of the week.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   You can find them yourselves.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.360]   Those folks, if you want to follow along at home, we have a delicious tag.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.520]   In fact, you can also submit ideas.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.200]   M-B-W-I-D-Is is the tag on delicious.com.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.840]   And Andy Ennaco found the first story.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.520]   Steve Jobs, according to Mac Rumors, might be writing his autobiography.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   Actually, it's according to Valley WAG, isn't it, Andy?
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:40.560]   Well, my official position is that I can either confirm nor deny that I am helping Mr.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.160]   Jobs work on this monumental epic and absolutely imperative book.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.640]   So I can know I can't confirm it.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.840]   I can't deny it.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.080]   So that's that and that's the end of my prepared statement.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.920]   By the way, I just like to say neither can I confirm nor deny and Frederick.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.240]   I'd co-author this because I just don't want that rumor to get into play.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.560]   I can't confirm on my Wikipedia page.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   That would be bad.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.360]   If it were to strip up my Amazon page, that would be a disaster.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.640]   So I can either, I'm trying to help you here.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.880]   I'm helping here.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   I'm just as much as I can say.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.080]   Thank you.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.720]   Somebody asked in the chat room, who would be easier to work with on an autobiography,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   Steve Jobs or Christian Bale?
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.200]   At least you'd have material, geez.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.880]   I would actually like to hear Steve's story from his point of view.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.800]   So many people have written about him in icon.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   They've been three or four by unauthorized biographies.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.160]   Wouldn't it be interesting to hear what it was like from his point of view?
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.960]   I would love to hear that with expletives and everything in there.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.760]   I'm just going to hear it raw.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.360]   The audio, just from the brain.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   It's just a funny version of it.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Read by the author.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   True.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   And then microphone is crap.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   Here's the character of the art.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   Oh, for God's sake.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.200]   You're coming to go with analog microphones.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   Okay, that's it.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   That's it.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   I'm Pam.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.840]   It'd be a short audio book, but entertaining.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   Yep.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.200]   Now, ValleyWag is not exactly the bastion of truth.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.360]   I think this might be one of those items where it's like wishful thinking.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.520]   But yeah, I think it's probably the most unlikely autobiography ever going to hear of.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.160]   I think Steve Jobs doing his own autobiography.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.600]   I think you're right.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.960]   Because he does he kind of shuns the spotlight.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.520]   He's such a private person, isn't he?
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.040]   So I don't think so.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.760]   Yeah, his private life is absolutely the third rail of journalism.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.040]   You touch it, you die.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.600]   It would be really significant to know that if you were actually working on it, because
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.440]   then we would know that it's not so much that he wants his private life to be private.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.320]   But so much as he wants to be able to control how the story gets told.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.920]   But I think he's been consistently, absolutely closed book on his private life.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.760]   And boy, that's almost an immediate fail that rumor.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   No truth to the rumor then that he's going to call it my life a bag of hurt.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.720]   Well, I can't tell you whether or not we've been discussing.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.800]   I can't confirm or deny that I'm working on this.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.840]   The makers of pair C, which is the newest Mac clone, a German company say, we feel in
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.160]   Germany it is legal to make an apple clone.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   Company is hyper mega net U.G. that brand is pair C. They have a basically OS 10 is installed
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.400]   on it, which of course violates apples.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.760]   You can't install OS 10 on anything.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   It's not an apple.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.320]   They're terms of service computer world says they talked to talk to the man in charge,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.880]   Dirk Blossi and Blossil.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   And he says, first we try to settle with apple out of court.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.120]   But if necessary, we are not afraid of going to court with apple.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:52.920]   I'm starting to sound like already that guy is very interesting, which I was thinking
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   the whole guy.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   Yeah, that guy.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   Yeah, I think.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   What is his name?
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   Artie Johnson Johnson.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.840]   Johnson, that's it.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:12.280]   And then Hogan on their website, the FAQ says under the question, is the pair C legal?
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:18.000]   The answer says, yes, according to European laws, apples, you'll is void.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.120]   Now, size stars is in court.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.680]   Apple took side start a court and side start kind of makes the same sort of noises, although
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   I don't think you could claim that in the US that that TOS is void, that you lose void.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.120]   It really is an interesting idea, though.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.920]   I mean, this is part of the usual legal dance.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.160]   I don't think that apple is wrong.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.840]   I don't think that all these clone makers are wrong.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.680]   It's the classic situation of, yeah, well, prove it, prove that we can't do this.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   And there is enough international law to say that maybe they can get away with it in certain
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   markets.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.560]   Apple could absolutely slam the door in anything that happens at the United States.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.680]   But they can't prevent that information from getting out and they can't prevent the basic
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   technology.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.000]   If this might be one of those things where they will settle this because they do not
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.280]   want a precedent on the books that says that apple does not have the right to control what
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.960]   hardware this this runs on.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.840]   They just don't want to go to court.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   They don't want that.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.200]   Well, they don't want that wedge to be as soon as you have that one case ruling that says
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.440]   that we put it before a judge, we put before, we put before people and people decided that
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.960]   yes, people do have the right to install whatever they want or whatever hardware they
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   want.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.640]   It's the same reason why the RIA hasn't taken a lot.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.880]   It doesn't really want a court case to go so far as to have a judge decide whether or
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   not I have the right to convert a Bluetooth, Bluetooth, excuse me, a Blu-ray disc or DVD
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.280]   into a file for my iPod.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.960]   They just don't want to take the chance that a court is going to say that is a basic,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.000]   absolute, emphatically stated right of the consumer to make copies of everything else
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.800]   because that's the first domino.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.160]   Couldn't Apple, if they wanted to at the very least, say, "Okay, yeah, yeah, go ahead."
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.320]   And then the next dot release of the operating system just tweak it so that it won't run
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   on the hardware.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   Yeah, I mean, I could.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   Invalidating all of this model.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   You know, just completely break it.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.240]   And just like with jail-braked iPhones, it's the same thing.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.840]   And just like all the different ways that they try to break the iTunes DRM.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.040]   That's like, what was that company that did that wonderful defiant like Moses on the rock
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.600]   sort of statement that, "Oh, yeah, Apple wants to deny the ability to sync these files
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   on other files."
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.200]   Well, we're standing up to Apple.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.760]   We've got this breakthrough technology.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.680]   Apple said, "What if we change this number from a 12 to a 14 here in the here in iTunes?"
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   "Yeah, there you go.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   You just lost your whole business."
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   Well, exactly.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.600]   And that's exactly what happens with the jailbreak, guys, is they have to go, you know,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.080]   kind of this cat and mouse.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.440]   "Battle Don, you're in the EU.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.360]   Have you been to Brussels lately?"
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   Not recently, no.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.960]   I mean, the specific law they're talking about, it is actually says it's a German law according
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   to Apple Insider.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.280]   And it's a bit weird in that they're saying that restrictions made after buying a product
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   are not valid.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.400]   And because Apple's the EU law.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.200]   Yeah, because you can only read it after you've actually bought and started the setup.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.080]   Oh, they're saying, okay, so those are the shrink-wrap licenses that have been fairly
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   controversial since day one.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.480]   You have to buy it, then by opening the package, you agree to it.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.120]   And so they've invalidated that in Germany, huh?
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.360]   Well, I don't know if they're actually putting it on the machine and you only get to see
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.320]   the EU law when it boots up, the saying that because you've already bought it, it's invalid.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.000]   But it just seems a bit bogus to me, I must admit.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And you can't.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's not, you can't.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.720]   I mean, they don't give you a chance.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   I guess they do.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   You could disagree.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.760]   I can't remember when you first turn on a Mac, does it say, do you agree to this?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.160]   And if you disagree, does it shut the Mac down, put itself back in the box and ship it back
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   to Cooper to know what happens.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.760]   When you look, if you buy a new Mac and you just crack it open and start up for the first
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   time.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   I don't think they give you a yes or no.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.880]   Yeah, except to decline.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   You do with OS 10.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.360]   When you're installing, yeah.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   When you're installing software, you have to click through.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.600]   But when you first buy one, I don't know that you have to agree to anything.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.640]   Oh, so maybe Germany is right.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.080]   I think I'm going to go buy one right now.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.480]   Yeah, let's just buy all buy an apple just to see.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:09.800]   Speaking of kind of draconian statements, Apple has declared that it is illegal, a violation
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.240]   of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to jailbreak your iPhone, the Electronic Frontier
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.320]   Foundation is fighting this when they've actually filed a brief saying we would like
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.600]   to get an exemption to DMCA here to say that this is in fact legal.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.360]   Seems to me once you bought a phone, it's not like you're unlocking it.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.440]   Your AT&T still gets your money.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.800]   You're just saying I want to run other people's applications on an apple says, no, you can't
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.880]   only applications we allow.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.320]   That's a little weird.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.240]   That always strikes me as like when you buy a house and the architect says, you can't
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   knock that wall down.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   Covenants.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   Well, that's well, wait a minute.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.040]   If the architect says it, I would listen.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   Well, you will get.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   Okay.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   You can't add a room.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.960]   The post says you cannot add a room to your house.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.120]   But there are, but you do.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.080]   Well, for instance, when we moved into our little cul-de-sac, there were covenants there
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.880]   that said we couldn't raise chickens without permission of all the other people.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.320]   Where were we called to say?
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   In Petaluma, because this used to be a big chicken area.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   Okay.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.880]   The law that you're allowed to, we could put a little chicken coop out back here.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   The cottage.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.200]   But in this particular housing development that we live in, they specifically forbid chickens
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.040]   or painting your house bright yellow.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.200]   I've heard of that in different communities that you have to actually have the, what is
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.080]   it in those those communities, gated communities where you have to actually get permission from
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.240]   your neighbors in order to.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.880]   I heard your house is hot pink.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   Is that true?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   My, yeah, it is.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   It is.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.480]   I'm painting the trim green though.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.440]   So Don, what do you think of apples?
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.200]   Which, great, man, that sounds pretty good.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.920]   That's like a candy apple kind of.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   Unlike it.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.320]   Basically, basically saying anybody with Google Earth come and find me.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Come find me.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   Look for the look for the two Wong Fu house.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.200]   And the gutters are trimmed in like feather boa, that sort of thing.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.800]   Hey, I got to be different.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.200]   Are you living with Luke Paul now?
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   What's the deal?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   What's that all about?
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Hey, don't hate.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   I hate to hate it.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.760]   So you can say, Hey world, I am what I am.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.320]   Jerry Herman said it best, the Greek philosopher.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   Jerry Herman.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.760]   I am what I am.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.960]   I got what I got.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   There she is again.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.480]   Oh, no, no, Andy needs to feather boa.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.880]   I could never see ever since Wally up and downloading a lot of Jerry Herman.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   That's actually, isn't that a great.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   Well, I'm not.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   I don't want to.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.320]   But all of your stuff on a brief moment, I'd like to just say hello to Drobo.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   Don McAllister.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.680]   Last time I was on, I was going to brush up on my accents, but now I start brushing
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   up on my singing now.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.560]   You always once ever heard of me, Andy.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.640]   I just can't cope with this.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.560]   And you need a boa.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.360]   What do you think of this?
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   It's sort of smacks of the similar thing is, you know, is it something they have to do
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.560]   to sort of make sure that everyone realizes a serious about it because I suppose it's
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.800]   like the copyright thing where they have to protect the copyright.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.360]   Do they feel that they have to sort of justify that or take this stand so to try and dissuade
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   people from actually doing it?
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.600]   I think that the worried about, you know, copyrights and also, I think, reliability
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   issues as well, I think that I think they just want to keep controls.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.600]   The usual apples control.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.120]   This is pissed people off myself included.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.200]   I don't jailbreak my iPhone, but I just think this is this is reaching your hand out into
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.560]   my phone saying you may only install applications that we approve, even if you want to assume
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.600]   the risk of putting of jailbreaking and admittedly everybody knows there's a somewhat of a risk
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   doing this.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.240]   And I'm assuming that risk you still can't put somebody you can't put turn by turn GPS
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   on there.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.120]   You can't, you know, put a tethering application on there.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.000]   Maybe it is to maybe it's to make AT&T happy.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I don't care what their excuses.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I think this is unconscionable.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.480]   It's also very tricky.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.440]   I mean, it's it's I want to make a comparison to problems with public beach access where
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.000]   you might have property that fronts the beach and you might have no problem with people
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.800]   using that beach and you know, that's in front of your house because you knew it when you
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   bought it.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.960]   But you still have to make sure that people don't climb over your fences and cut through
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.520]   your yard to get there.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.360]   And as far as I understand, that's well, at least that's the reason that Apple is using
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.800]   to explain to file these suits.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.000]   They're saying that you have to modify Apple software and violate their copyrights in
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.400]   order to get these boot loaders working.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.080]   And so I really do think that they're just using that as an excuse.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.600]   But it really does point to the fact that software is a really complicated, really complicated
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   machine.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.000]   If you break one part of it, is that the same as breaking all of it?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.960]   I think it's with jail breaking though.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.480]   It's such a it's such a I know it's easy to do, but it is such a major thing that is
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   it.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   I think it's pretty benign.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.600]   In fact, if you do if you've jailbroken nowadays, if you've jailbroken, we're not talking
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.760]   remember, we're not talking unlocking that is that you have to change the radio firmware
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.160]   and that that's significant.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.200]   But this if you for instance update your jailbroken iPhone, if you went from two to updated to
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.000]   two to one, all it does is revert to an un jailbroken iPhone.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It doesn't.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.640]   Yeah, ever since when I was one of the people that stood in line for the first iPod or for
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.840]   the first iPhone and hours, how would you wait six hours?
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.400]   It was about five, six hours.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.880]   Yeah, Santa Monica Apple store.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.520]   And after that, everybody started jail breaking the phones and all these new applications
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.400]   started showing up to do all these wonderful things.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   That was cool.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   So I did it.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.800]   And then when Apple released the update, there was a warning of your break.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.840]   You will break your phone from and I just I went through it shaky hands and updated and
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   it didn't break my phone.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.520]   And from that point forward, I said again, I'm just I'll play within the lines from the
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.840]   same day open the app store.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.400]   I felt like I don't have to jailbreak it.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   Mm hmm.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   Yeah, it really is every every single time there's been a device that people have broken
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:53.080]   be it a piece PSP be it like a open source laptop, things like that, or even be it the
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.280]   original iPod when people try to get Linux going on it.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.480]   Most of the people who take part in these projects, they're really enforcing a really
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.920]   cool and important principle.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.400]   That is that if I own this hardware, I have the right to do whatever I want with it.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   Now it's a great principle, but you know, after I put, you know, Linux on my iPod, I
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.840]   realize that, wow, I have essentially I have taken away a really cool iTunes based music
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.720]   player and turned into something that's almost a command line.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.680]   I'm an ag-vorbist player.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.960]   It was it was a fun exercise.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   I'm glad I did it.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   I learned a lot.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.800]   I enjoyed sticking it to the man for the 45 minutes.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.960]   I was using this.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.320]   Now let's put the old opera.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.160]   Let's put the copyrighted stuff back on because it just works better.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.040]   I mean, Apple Apple really is like using a howitzer against a fly here.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.560]   I mean, the the the reliability card that they're playing is is I mean, if someone jail breaks
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.320]   the phone, they know the consequences of what might happen.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.600]   And, you know, I don't think it's actually done by lame and it's normally done by people
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   who understand the concept of what jailbreaking is.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.400]   And, you know, if if it goes bang or if anything happens to it, well, fair enough, you accept
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   that responsibility.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.080]   So I don't think protecting the average consumer because of that.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.680]   Those in the jail breaking community already know what they're in for.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.120]   If they go down that road.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.400]   Well, and now here's the story that Adobe's announced at mobile world congress this week
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.720]   that air and flash real flash, not just flashlight, but flash 10 will be available on the palm
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.320]   pre and many other phones, not the iPhone because Apple doesn't want it.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.360]   And this is another reason why you, you know, you kind of think, maybe I ought to jailbreak
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   that thing.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.960]   I don't know.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.840]   Is will there and has there been rumors that support the fact that there'll be a jailbroken
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   version of flash available?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   Ah, well, that's a good question.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   I don't know if that would help you there.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   Right.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.040]   Wasn't it only last week or the week before they were saying that they were in, they were
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.200]   sort of working alongside Apple's track.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.160]   Yeah, but Apple never said anything.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   It was Adobe.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.720]   It was all unilateral.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.280]   And now Adobe, I think Adobe's been trying to, you know, kind of strong arm Apple into
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.360]   this and by making these announcements and now by making this announcement, Apple is
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.600]   conspicuously absent along with blackberries.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   Wow.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.680]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no mobile.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.080]   Nokia's S 60 and Palm pre.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.320]   I think Apple's got to pay attention.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.080]   The pre's going to come out in a couple of months.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   What do you think of the pre?
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.280]   Oh, well, from the videos purely from the video, another video came out this week and
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   it looks great.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   You've got to see it.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.440]   You know, I thought the storm looks great too.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   But this, I mean, if the pre plays flash, full flash.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.960]   But if the pre if the pre crashes like every other browser that runs flash, I mean, you
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.480]   know, five months before we started recording, you know, Safari shut down on me.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   Right.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.720]   And every time of either Firefox or Safari either locks up or shuts down, I know it's
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   a problem with flash.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.240]   Oh, you think it's flash?
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.360]   I don't even guess anymore.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.240]   I mean, there maybe there's a one in 10 chance that it's something else, but it's almost
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.400]   always the fact that, well, you're running a website that tried to load in something
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.480]   really kinky and it locked you up or just kept gobbling memory.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.080]   The reason why I cannot keep a browser running, you know, you know, more than a day or two
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.520]   in a row is almost always flash.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.600]   So if so, that's that's pre is going to be interesting.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.800]   I mean, if they're investing so heavily in flash and it turns out that the pre works just
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.000]   great and it's perfectly stable, then Apple's going to have a lot explaining to do.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.240]   I think, I think just fundamentally when you're running flash or something that's sort of
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.960]   unstable, like you're talking about Andy on a device as mission critical as your phone,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.440]   it's a different experience than when you're on your, your MacBook Pro and it crashed and
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.400]   you're like, okay, I'll just, I'll just restart.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.600]   But if you're driving or you're someplace where you really need to use that phone, it
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.960]   becomes a different sort of annoyance level to me, you know,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.120]   Adobe says flash is ready for the phone, but Apple just won't permit them to do it.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.880]   It's like, it's like Andy's argument in the beginning, you know, it's, he can't confirm
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.360]   or deny that he's right.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.560]   We know that's possibly, oh no, I, I confirm that I'm one of the lead developers on flash
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   10.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   I can, I can confirm that.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.280]   It was, it was my idea.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.040]   I stormed right into that whiteboard and said, how about flash from old devices?
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.720]   And then it said, holy crap, write this guy a big check.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.080]   You said, Hey, we've got flash nine.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   What about?
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.960]   Okay, go with me on this one.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   Flash 10.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.400]   They were going to go with flash Vista.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.960]   I said, no, let me, let me show you some brochures because another company tried that
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   and it didn't work out.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   Well, they're back to that.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   I just want to be a user.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.280]   I just want to be a consumer on everything to work everywhere.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   That's it.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.280]   So you've been bit by that jailbreak and now you're saying no more.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.440]   I, I, I just, and you know, it's true.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.680]   I'm scared straight.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.960]   I'm staying, I'm staying in the sandbox.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.360]   A little tough love for a friend man, man.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   And no more rogue bits on my phone.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.880]   You know, I needed to act as a phone when I needed to act as a phone.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.760]   You know, people have been complaining about two, two, one, that it's killed the battery
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   life.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   That's been my experience battery life.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.200]   Now it's back to what it was before to do to do and a lot of dropped calls in the yesterday
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.280]   right in the middle of two calls dropped.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.960]   And I'm thinking maybe the apple did something weird with two, two, one that that have impacted
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.880]   but but back up what you're saying, Frederick, it pained me.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.560]   It's like, no, this phone has to work.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   Why is this dropping calls?
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   No, no, no.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.120]   It's not an experimental sort of, I'm going to load this application and see and play
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   with it for a while.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.480]   You know, this is a communications device, especially for somebody like Alex, you know,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.960]   who has a pregnant wife.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   That's right.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.360]   And you're playing around with rogue applications on your phone and you miss that critical call.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   You know, it's just no room for that.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:29.960]   So is that why Apple said no to the South Park application on the iPhone?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.560]   It's potentially quote, potentially offensive South Park application.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.280]   The company has now twice rejected an iPhone application designed to let iPhone owners
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.880]   watch clips of the long running show featuring the exploits of Stan Kyle Cartman and Kenny.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.280]   Apple says the content is offensive according to blowing morning and we just won't allow
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.320]   it into the into the store.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   They banned in the past banned books for using dirty language.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.560]   And yet there is I fart.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.960]   Well, it's not a mission statement.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.800]   It's not part of it.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.040]   I think that's I think it's part of the business.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.600]   It's a judgment call.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.560]   The number one paid entertainment application on the app store, the yo mama joke generator.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   I have not heard of that one.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.080]   Now you might come out on have that.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   Tell me if this is offensive.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.360]   And as such classic says, and this is I'm quoting this.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.920]   I'm reading it in dialect, yo mama so stupid she spent 20 minutes looking at an orange juice
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.960]   box because it said concentrate.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.760]   Actually, that's pretty funny.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.240]   Is that free or is it 99?
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   No, it's paid.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.520]   I'm buying that case you ran out of insults.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.680]   I would never run out.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.280]   What did they call that built in?
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.920]   They call that the dozens right where you go back and forth.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.560]   And you would look really, really cool like reading your dozens from an iPhone.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.160]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   Hold on.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   Flash has crashed it.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.920]   I have a right party.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.640]   Apparently when your mother does hang on loading.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   Swipe, swipe, swipe.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   It does.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.800]   You have to put a boomerang on the end of the belt and throw it.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   I'm just reading.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   She puts on her belt with a boomerang is what I'm getting at.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   Oh, hang on.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   There's something better than that.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   Let me check.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.520]   I am so down loading that application.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.400]   The good news is if you get it wrong, you can blame the iPhone.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   And slightly down the list, wobble bikini fun.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.720]   Of course, we've all seen it.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.000]   Wobble is hours of fun.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.360]   It's pretty funny because you can make anybody part wobble.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.080]   And that's I think what's kind of amusing about the whole thing.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.760]   And change the size.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.440]   Jealing your nose, your toes.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.800]   It's that it was going to issue the developer said they were going to issue an update that
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.520]   allowed independent wobbling of the spheres.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.120]   That's and gravity.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   Gravity.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   That's just what everybody wants.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   You know, you mean that physics?
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   They did make them change that to say anybody part instead of the funny bits.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.600]   Either the left or the right breast.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.640]   It's very flex.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.920]   Maybe now this we should really maybe give Apple more credit because it might be the
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:17.040]   fact that I think this would also allow you to stream video into the South Park.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   Not the wobble.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.640]   I'm sorry, Fred got all excited.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.160]   That would be interesting.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.680]   No, the South Park.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.440]   Full live wobbling video.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   I've got plenty of the video streaming services.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.520]   And we've got live videos.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   The TED application is great.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   TED.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520]   You stream streams.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520]   That's right.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   I can't believe it.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   I can't believe it.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   I can't say it being the mechanism.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   But again, the content.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.680]   I mean, South Park, I mean, it's not.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   I want what I can.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.120]   I keep trying to tell my 14 year old he's not allowed to watch South Park.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.920]   And he just, you know, it's 14 year old humor.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   He loves it.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.840]   How can you know?
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.640]   I find it incredibly offensive.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.200]   The latest George Lucas episode that was that was interesting.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   That was that.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.720]   See, that's what that's the best you could say.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   That was interesting.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.280]   I'm so far behind on that stuff.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.400]   Every now and then I'll catch a South Park episode and I'm like, wow, they'll, they put
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   that on TV.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   Yeah, damn old.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.920]   That's what always surprises me.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.200]   What really explained the show to me a lot was finding out that everything associated
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   with that production is all in like one office in one building.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.960]   And they put these things together in about a week or two.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.920]   It's kind of done like Saturday Night Live.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.560]   It's not like they write a script.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   They animate it.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560]   They send it up to go.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.560]   Oh, you're absolutely right.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.920]   They're literally in a place where whatever idea comes into their head, they have absolute
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.520]   total power to just do it and they don't get like a week to think about it.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.800]   So that's every time they've done a great show or a bad show, I've always, I'm always
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.280]   thinking, yeah, that's one because no one got a chance to stick their head and say, oh,
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.960]   guys, dudes, dudes.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   Think about that.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.440]   No, in fact, Kat Schwartz, who I used to work with on a call for help's husband is an
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.200]   animator for South Park.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   And that's you actually hit the nail on the head, Andy.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.400]   They get together.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.640]   They have this incredible production schedule of a few months where they're just working
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   like crazy and then they don't do anything for a while.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.240]   So you're right, they do it all at once.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   That's great.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   And it's a crazy workplace.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.360]   I understand that speaking of money machines, one of the things Trey likes to do is he brought
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.880]   in a one of those radio stations to them.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.840]   They have a, it's like a phone booth that blows dollar bills around and they brought
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.440]   this into the office and everybody had to disrobe and you could keep as many of the
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.840]   dollar bills as you got as long as you went in there naked to grab them.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.040]   That sounds like a Howard Stern stunt.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.560]   No, that sounds like something got him like the steel barons like Carnegie would say,
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.560]   all right.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.160]   Well, I'm going to throw pennies into this 40 foot.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   Exactly.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.880]   And you've jumped in after them.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   You can have your notes.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   All yours.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   Do that in a recession.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.320]   It's sort of like, let us watch in point.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   Dive to save your house from foreclosure.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.120]   Get in when child is unfreezing to death.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   Come on.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.840]   Bark like a little dog.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.560]   You're a naughty little dog.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   Our super.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   All right, we're going to come back in just a bit and talk about the iPhone app.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   People allowed, but Vegas won't.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.120]   But first I want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.440]   They are of course sponsors of the show.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   We are big fans of audible.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.640]   We use the audible books like crazy.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   Just now finishing.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.920]   I got it for Lincoln's birthday.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.480]   I'm just finishing your recommendation.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.560]   Andy, a team of rivals and I just loved that.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.680]   It was so good.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.000]   And I found out Andy, by the way, they're making a movie out of it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.800]   Spielberg's producing.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.960]   Tony Kushner is writing the screenplay.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.920]   He's a guy who did the Angels play on Broadway.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   Angels over America.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   Angels over America.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   Angels of America.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.760]   And so he's a great screenwriter.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.680]   So that'll be out next year.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.600]   Lincoln was, I was reading the book and thinking, we're listening.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.160]   I keep saying reading.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.920]   Listening to the book and thinking, this is a movie.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.440]   That's one of the things that happens when you do audible books is they are so, you know,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.600]   I guess the same thing will happen when you read, but when you're listening to somebody
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.120]   and you're driving or you're at the gym or whatever, it's visual.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.760]   I mean, you really, it feels like a movie is playing out in your head.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.280]   And that's one of the things I love about audible so much.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak, if you'd like to sign up for the gold account, that gives you a
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.480]   book, it's a subscription, basically a book a month at a very good price.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.280]   Now if you do that now, you'll get a credit toward a book that's yours to keep free.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.720]   So it's a great way to try it before you, you know, commit.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak, you know what's great now?
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.360]   I think probably most of the people listening to this show now are Audible subscribers.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.680]   So it's really fun because I'm getting the feedback and people just say, "Wow, thank
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.800]   you for turning me on to this.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.720]   I never listened to your show anymore."
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.400]   You know, stuff like that.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   I no longer need to listen.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.880]   Trying to get through my library.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   I've got books now.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   Thank you.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Bye.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.800]   But one of the reasons we'd like to recommend books every show is for those of you who are
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.360]   already members of Audible, something for you to listen to.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.640]   Andy, do you have something you want to?
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.000]   I love Andy's recommendations.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.400]   I've downloaded them all.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   Yeah, this is...
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.880]   The recommendation this time is "Devil in the White City" by Eric Lars.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   That I've read.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   And that you've left.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   It was on my...
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.680]   I want to read this list for a long time.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.360]   And then once again, like every...
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.200]   You know that we know what day per month that one credit appears in your inbox.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.640]   They start going shopping inside what you're going to buy and I decided to go get it.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.680]   For those of you who haven't heard about this book, it really covers a couple topics
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.000]   that are always interesting.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.760]   I'm always fascinated by phenomenal...
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:42.180]   Phenomenons and international events that made sense a hundred years ago but seemed absolutely
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.240]   nuts to us today.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.760]   And it's about events surrounding the...
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.240]   How the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 came to be and how it was put together and who
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.720]   designed it and who ran it.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:59.560]   It seems incredible that 100 years ago, there was this big deal where your city would sort
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:07.080]   of fight other world cities for the privilege of building a 250,000 citizen community with
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.160]   buildings, like a whole city with electricity and plumbing and everything just so that everybody
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.080]   in the world could come by and see how cool your city is.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   It was sort of like the Olympics.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.240]   We'd put all this huge amounts of infrastructure into building all this all this cool stuff.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.280]   Oftentimes you will be in a city like if you go to...
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.720]   If you're in San Francisco and you visit the Palace of Fine Arts and you think, "Wow, this
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.960]   is a weird sort of proto-Roman-esque portico only.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.240]   It's like 40 stories high and all the cherubs are made of cut diamonds."
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.040]   And you realize, "Oh no, they hosted the World's Fair and this is the big set thing
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.520]   they built so that everyone can see, 'Hey, look how awesome we are.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   We can build something like this.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   We don't even care."
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.160]   Well, the funny thing is it washed away and the only thing that was left was the Palace
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.240]   of Fine Arts and then they reinforced it because it was made of plastic.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.080]   I mean, it was up to the plaster.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.040]   A lot of these World's Fair cities were almost built like giant parade floats.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.240]   They were designed to be really, really pretty but they realized that really this is for the
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.800]   eight or nine or 10 million people who will be coming to visit here over the next eight
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   months.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.200]   It's not necessarily for all the working-class people we displaced to build this shining
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.720]   new World's Fair city.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   So this is...
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.960]   The Devil in the White city follows two different sort of parallel tracks.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.040]   It's the interesting process of Chicago wanting to host the World's Fair and designing all
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   this architecture and all this infrastructure to make it happen.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.440]   I was very surprised to find out that two architects who are kind of big in Boston, Charles
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.800]   McCame, who designed the Boston Public Library, and Frederick Law Olmsted, who's famous for
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   all this parks.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.040]   They're part of the people who designed this World's Fair facility for Chicago.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.440]   But it's also the story of an exciting little entrepreneur.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.560]   Almost Steve Jobsian in his scale because you look for opportunity.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.880]   Sometimes you have to make those opportunities.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.760]   He realized that millions and millions of people are going to be coming to Chicago from
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.240]   all over the place.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.560]   I bet I can make a lot of money by building a hotel, like a really brand new hotel with
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:07.960]   all kinds of interesting amenities built into it, such as trap doors, crematoriums, gas
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.360]   chambers, things like that, trap doors, pits, dead fall, things like that.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:18.000]   So that when people would come and check into my hotel, I could kill them quickly and efficiently
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.160]   dump them in bats of caustic chemicals, take their skeletons, and sell them to medical
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.440]   supply houses.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.840]   And because it's such a transient population, no one will ever notice people were missing
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.400]   and they'll never figure out that they came to my hotel.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.440]   And boy, it was a big, it's a lot like a lot of technology products.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.760]   He had a lot of success for a little while.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.360]   But apparently, market force is caught up to him.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:47.080]   In addition to the addition to law enforcement, it really is an amazing story.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.880]   I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.600]   You really are like, you know, Eric Larson, you know, you had a great story to begin with,
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.560]   about the factual story about building the building the world's fair.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.280]   You know, you didn't have to make this hokey slasher film 19 cheap 1980s fiction about
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.560]   this serial killer who built this how hotel of death with trap doors and pits and stuff.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.760]   Oh, that really happens.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   It's true.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   Well, that's what's weird about this.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.440]   I don't think people even remember the great Chicago exposition, let alone this serial killer,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.520]   this mass murderer.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.560]   And it's just an amazing story.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   And you're right.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   It's two stories in one.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.560]   I couldn't put it down.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.560]   I just love it.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.520]   So next time someone blames Grand Theft Auto for like all the violence in our culture, you
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.360]   know, point them to this book.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.600]   But you know, PlayStation didn't start the fire.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.040]   It was always burned into the world's most turn in.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.400]   It's really one of my, I mean, again, it is a little gory and gruesome.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.440]   I mean, if you're, if you're uncomfortable with the idea of this guy enticing young ladies
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:55.200]   to Chicago and then locking them in the safe until they expired so he could then, oh, I
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.600]   mean, it's, it's amazing.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   Wow.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   Yeah, it's called the devil in the white city.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.240]   The white city is the Chicago exposition of it was 1893.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:07.320]   And the devil, of course, is this guy, dramatic story.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   Eric Larson.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   Now there's a bridge and unabridged.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.400]   And of course, you know me.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.960]   I like the, actually a lot of times with nonfiction, I'll do the unabridged, but in this case,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.160]   I think you want the, you want all the grit, you want the whole thing is long, 14 hours,
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   but it could be yours free audible.com/macbreak when you sign up 51,000 titles.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:31.920]   And the best books ever history like this, but come on children now.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.520]   Turn your app and I'll book the page 43.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.440]   This is the real story, but it is, it's history.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.480]   And in fact, it's fascinating.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.600]   You know, I've read a law instead of course did Golden Gate Park after this.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.040]   And the story of, you know, I mean, the bill, one of the buildings collapsed.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.640]   I mean, it's just, it's an amazing, they had huge rainstorms.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.120]   It was the invention of the Ferris wheel.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.880]   And that's the part of the story too.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.920]   You know, France had the Eiffel Tower.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.800]   Chicago said, we need something of equal magnitude.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.880]   This engineer named Ferris said, well, I can make you a giant wheel.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.760]   We'll put people in the spokes and we'll turn it around.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.560]   Nobody had any idea.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.600]   They were terrified to get in this thing.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.320]   And they thought, well, is it going to work?
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.480]   Is it going to fail spectacularly?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   And of course it didn't.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   It was huge though.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   Wasn't it any?
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.760]   It was much bigger than today's Ferris wheels.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.640]   Yeah, it wasn't as big as the London Eye, but it was a fear.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.880]   Especially considering the limits of engineering back then.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.080]   This is 1893.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080]   This is section.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   They built the London Eye.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.160]   They've built it and cost it to fail inside the computer.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.240]   And they've killed 100,000 people in a digital sense before they even decide to move to the
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   next stage of development.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.160]   They were basically saying, we've got some math.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.560]   It's sort of, we had to do it with pencil and eraser.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.600]   But we think that there's a very good chance that people won't die.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.200]   Well, and there were things falling off of it.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.680]   Like the first time they turned it on, I guess there were extra bolts.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.120]   Things were hailing at, I mean, it's just incredible story.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.280]   The Devil in the White City, Eric Larson, it is an audible pick and I think a great one,
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   Andy.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.040]   And also, it's not the only choice on audible.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   Comedy to just romance a huge science fiction library.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.600]   They've done such a great job of building that up.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.160]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   We love them.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.320]   We thank them for their support of all of our shows.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.840]   We just signed another six month deal with them.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.360]   They're going to continue on, not just this show, but all the Twitch shows.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.280]   They're really a great supporter of what we're doing here at Twitch.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   And we are of them.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.920]   We thank them for their support.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.840]   Did you ever read any Audible audio books?
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.640]   Don, are you?
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.400]   Yeah, to be honest, I haven't read the, I know they do have movie in the...
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   They do?
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   I take that one.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.680]   I tell her, I got the icon you mentioned before.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   Oh, that's a great one.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   The steel job stuff, yeah.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   Yeah, that was quite interesting.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   I just did that on holiday.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   I like to read on holiday.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.760]   That was the first time I actually took one away and didn't have to worry about my glasses
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.360]   and my sunglasses and just listened to the book.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.920]   So that was quite neat.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.440]   I think that it's a acquired skill to listen to audio books.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.640]   The first time you do it, you might be a little disoriented.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.560]   But as you get used to it now, I mean, I've been doing it for 10 years.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.120]   It depends on your schedule too, right?
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.240]   Well, if you drove, how long was your drive up here?
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   It was two hours.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.400]   If you had bought a book, you would halfway through the book here and back.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   But I was listening to podcasts.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   I never used to listen to podcasts.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   Oh, I'm not going to stop you from doing that.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.840]   So, yeah, I used to listen to them.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.240]   I'm definitely going to get back into listening to all the books.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   No, no.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.880]   I'm going to, but I typically listen to non-fiction stuff.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:40.320]   So I'm currently immersed in trying to learn Google Analytics and that kind of thing.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.920]   So if they have anything there, that we'll just...
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.960]   I'm excited about the new Kindle.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.120]   Did we talk about this last week, Andy, that will read to you?
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   Oh, the text of speech in there.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.680]   And you've heard about the controversy, quote unquote controversy.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.040]   This really, this makes me nuts.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040]   What is it?
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   The writer's guild or the...
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   Right, isn't the right...
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:08.520]   Well, they're essentially saying that if I publish a book, I can sell the audio books,
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.200]   the audio book writes separately.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:16.520]   So the fact that the Kindle has a text to speech feature where it can read any electronic
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.520]   book aloud.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:24.240]   So basically, they're saying that it is essentially stealing my audio book writes by incorporating
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.160]   them into the electronic writes, which is an interesting thing.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.200]   I mean, sometimes I picture myself like having a briefing with their representative and
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.720]   like listening and going, "Uh-huh, uh-huh."
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.040]   And saying, "Okay, so the headline and the first paragraph is that according to like,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.880]   you know, the writer's organization, electronically spoken text is just as good as professionally
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880]   performed audio books."
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.040]   This is a great story.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.480]   You're endorsing the skill of electronic synthetic text.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   It's that good.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.640]   That's because you're terrified.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.720]   You're saying that it's just...
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   You're saying that the electronic version that's being synthesized on the fly is just
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.400]   as good as an actor in a studio with lots of time and professional.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   This is wonderful.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   But no, no, no, no.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   We're saying this tripling on our writes.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.800]   Oh, it's tripling on your writes, but you're saying that it's greatly important technology.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.600]   And of course, that's rubbish because, you know, it's a totally separate thing.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.480]   I mean, I think the organization is doing what it's supposed to be doing, which is to
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.520]   be looking after the interests of its members as best as it can.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:31.640]   Sometimes as worked up as I get about the RAA or the MPAA, the purpose of that organization
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   is not to look after the interests of the consumers, but to look after the interview.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   That's their job.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   So let's be fair and just acknowledge that.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.440]   Maybe they're not just idiots, but it's like, oh, God, dude, pick your battle.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.520]   Especially since the Kindle is going to be...
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.040]   I think it really is going to be the key to reinventing publishing.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.520]   I mean, you need to have closer ties with Amazon.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.760]   You need to have closer ties with electronic publishing.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.520]   You don't want to cause the next person who's about to invest $10 million in electronic
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.280]   publishing formats and platforms.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.080]   You don't want them to say, oh, but you know, there's this added element of risk because
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.080]   if you do something that this organization doesn't like, they're going to file lawsuits
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.720]   and it's going to tie up all the legal rights and then all this money we're going to be
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.560]   putting into R&D will be lost.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   You, boy, just keep the pillow out of the crib.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.360]   Let the baby breathe.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.880]   Let him grow.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.560]   Sudden book death syndrome.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.080]   Well, and also it's an electronic voice.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.720]   I mean, it's not going to compete with the true audience.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   Let me play you.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   This is what it's going to sound like.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.560]   I think they're going to use a voice very similar to the Leopard.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.920]   The devil in the White City actually starts as two different stories that the author gradually
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.160]   stitches together into one captivating whole.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.760]   Both stories are engaging on the other.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.800]   See, I think you can, I think you can.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.520]   This book comes in the way the author can't stop it.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   I can't stop it.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.520]   I know.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.520]   Is that engrossing?
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   I can't stop it.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   This is a place.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   I'm riveting.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.520]   Stop talking.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   In the novel.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.040]   Oh, thank goodness.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.400]   I think that while that will work fine.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.800]   I mean, for instance, I now get on the Kindle now, the New Yorker.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   Yay.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   And Atlantic.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.960]   And I think while I'm in the car, the idea of newspapers listening to ephemera via us.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.240]   That's never going to be on an audio book.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.560]   I'm listening to that is fine.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.960]   I can understand it.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   But it's not going to compete with Scott Brick reading the devil in the White City.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   I don't think that's.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.040]   It's looking with the Leopard voice as well as that that was quite a leap up from the
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   original Tiger voice.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.040]   I mean, it does.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   It's totally listenable.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.320]   But it's going to be really well.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320]   Well, we'll know next weekend.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.360]   I'm sure I know Andy's getting a review unit and I've ordered one.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   So we'll know by next week.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.400]   I think in a pinch that would be really good.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.840]   You know, if you're in the middle of something and you're, you know, okay, now I have to
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.040]   drive now and I want to keep going.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:54.200]   But I'm not going to listen to a whole autobiography of Barack Obama listening to that voice.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   I have.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.000]   I mean, I've been, well, I'm going to plug my iPhone and my iPod books.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.360]   There's, I put it, I've read about these techniques that you can use in the software.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.840]   You can use that will convert like emails and web pages, whatever you're interested in,
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.800]   in a spoken text using built in, text, text, speech.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   And it works fine.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   I mean, you can follow along with it, but it's not the same.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.160]   You don't get a performance out of it.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   You get a reading.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.960]   That's how you, that's what you, how you describe it.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.040]   You get a reading, but you don't get a performance and you want a performance of the book.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.520]   So, but they both have their places and I don't know.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.840]   I think that's one of the most, it's kind of not been paid attention to, but one of the
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.320]   most interesting features is the new Kindle.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   Can you switch the voice?
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320]   Can you like put it in hysterical?
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   I want it in hysterical.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   I want it in hysterical.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:37.440]   I would, I would actually very much enjoy because Amazon also, the Kindle also supports
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Audible.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:43.520]   So wouldn't it be fantastic if they were a way to index the readable version and the
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.200]   audio version so that I can be like, I can be at the sandwich shop eating lunch, reading
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.480]   this book for about an hour, go into my car, plug it into my, plug it into the car stereo.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.240]   It knows that I left off a page, you know, 28.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.840]   So we'll start reading the book where I left off.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.840]   And then when I start reading again, it starts again where the Audible book worked off.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.600]   I mean, this is the sort of thing that the book publishers and writers' guilds should
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.040]   really be investing in because when you have, I buy it once, it'll actually encourage me
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.680]   to buy multiple copies of this thing if I'll always have the same seamless reading experience
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.200]   across all platforms and all situations.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   That's a very interesting point.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   You're right.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   Amazon owns Audible.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.600]   That's a very interesting point.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.420]   And see, if I'm the, if I'm the writer's guild, I'm going to start to say, we like you,
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:33.200]   Amazon, you know, you're, you're, let me give you a bigger shovel that you, you, you
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   shovel money into my pocket.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.840]   Yeah, ultimately, that's what it is.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.400]   And most, and you know this, Andy, I've written 13 books, most books don't, you know, they
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   make not a lot of money.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.200]   I mean, on the order of thousands of dollars, not tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.880]   So anything that helps the books do better is great.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.600]   Living, you're actually, as an author, you're very pleased if your book earns out, meaning
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.440]   that if it makes back all the money that they put, put into like your advance and all that
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.200]   of the, all the other stuff.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   And that doesn't always happen.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.040]   I mean, we're, already we're seeing situations where we're not just talking about writers
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.840]   get less money or fewer books get published.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.200]   We're talking about the disappearance of the midlist.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.000]   We're talking about margins getting so slight that publishers used to have this business
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.480]   mom where they would say, we think we, we love this manuscript.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   We think that this author has a great future.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.560]   We know that his first two or three books aren't going to make money, but it's going to, after
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   the third book, he's going to build up enough of an audience that he'll, that this will
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.520]   be every year he comes up with a book and we make money off of it.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:33.880]   Now they're in the sort of financial situation where they don't like to wait for two books
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.000]   to come out before they start making money.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.280]   And so we're talking, we're seeing a lot of books that just don't get published to begin
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   with.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.680]   So the, the, the sooner that books like that, that ebook readers like this take off and
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   take off big.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.160]   I mean, I mean, the better.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.000]   I mean, I really don't understand what the right of skill is, is up above.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.320]   I mean, especially I'll, I'll, I'll button this up because I'm, I really am looking
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.680]   seriously in a self publishing for a lot of my future stuff.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.040]   And the exciting bit is the ability to create your own manuscript, edit your own manuscript
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.160]   or hire someone to edit it for you, whatever.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.960]   And then it is so easy to publish something on the Kindle.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.480]   It is 40 times easier to get an ebook in the Amazon.com library, a Kindle library than
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.800]   it is to get a piece of software in the iPhone app library.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.040]   You can then lose your money.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.560]   You can write your first money, lose two money losing books on your own dime and with almost
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.600]   no investment on your, on your part.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.560]   And then after those first two books start to build an audience.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.680]   Now the publishers are going to get interested in you because you've built up an audience.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.120]   You're building, you can tell them, look, I stole 30,000 copies of this electronically.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.040]   I'm not an unknown, unproven thing.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.560]   So that's why the Kindle and other ebook readers like it are going to be a key to the future
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.560]   of publishing.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.000]   And like I said, keep the pillow out of the crib.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.520]   Let the, let the baby breathe.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.760]   That's a great, I think a great analogy.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.920]   Did they publish any numbers as to what the Kindle's installed basis?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.760]   They never have said, you know, they sell out, but we don't know how many they're making.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   They made 15 and now they're sold out.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.800]   They've, they've, they've inferred now analysts have inferred that it is somewhere between
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.960]   half a million and a million only by virtue of looking at statements that they've made
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.280]   to stockholders and statements that people, people who make components for the Kindle
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.120]   have stated how many of these components that they've made.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.360]   One has ever said, here's how many Kindle's are in the field right now.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.920]   But the best, the 500,000 seems a little seems pretty solid.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.120]   It might be a little bit low.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.520]   They know it's not more than about 800,000 or 900,000.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.440]   At least that, excuse me, numbers that I have seen.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.960]   And again, this is all guesswork, but it's informed guesswork at least.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.600]   It's, it's, it's, we know how many, yeah, sorry, Andy, we know how many they've sold
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.840]   over here in the UK though.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   Oh, how many?
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   Zero.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.840]   Oh, that's right.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840]   That was a joke.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   That was a trick.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   A trick question.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   It's only in the US.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.640]   But, but the thing is, you know, that's, you don't understand the concept of the long
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   tale.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.760]   Maybe zero users, but it's zero important.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.280]   It's a million zero.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.640]   So how, what is the feeling in the UK about that?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Is there bitterness?
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.120]   Yeah, because especially with them bringing out the version two before we even get version
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.920]   one, you know, it's, I think one of the stumbling blocks has been, yeah, tell me about it.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   One of the stumbling blocks has been the network.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.560]   The only thing that's going to be kicking the pants would be, you know, we're going
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.080]   to let you have the old crappy ones that we don't like it for.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.400]   The ones that look like the, the Aztec, right?
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.440]   Still bitter about the tea party thing.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   Yeah, we're still mad.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.760]   But I think a lot of it is publishing rights and it's complicated, you know, and plus,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.200]   of course, that wireless thing they've got, they'd have to deal with orange or somebody
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   to give you free wireless.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.560]   I think that's probably the big sum of it.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.080]   Might just then you want 3G, isn't it?
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   So hopefully that will.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.080]   Is it?
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   It's faster.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.240]   I don't know if it's 3G, is it?
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   That's interesting.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.240]   100% sure.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.400]   But I think they changed the network inside of it.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   I think so.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.160]   What's the stock company like Apple from just making a larger iPhone, you know, iPod
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   touch type device?
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.160]   Well, I think that's what everybody's wondering.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   Is it?
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.760]   Well, there's the whole book back end, right?
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.840]   Well, see that the Amazon, now I've been talking Amazon about this.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.000]   Someone, a senior executive, I don't have it in front of me, but someone very, very
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   senior at Amazon gave a quote to the New York Times saying that they are actively pursuing
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.320]   the idea of moving Amazon DRM onto mobile devices onto laptops on other things.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.120]   The implication being that at some point you will be able to buy an Amazon Kindle app for
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:26.280]   the iPhone and either purchase your books and read them on the iPhone or, and this is
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   a specific new feature of Kindle 2.0.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.680]   If you have copies of your books across multiple devices, they can synchronize with each other
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:39.440]   so that if you do read it on, if you do have, let's say you have three different kindles,
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.320]   if you start reading it on Kindle number one and then you have the dashboard mounted Kindle
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.240]   in your car and then the one that you only keep in your boat or your yacht that they'll
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.560]   keep in touch with each other and make sure that they keep synchronized.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   So the idea would be that you can be reading for 10 minutes while waiting in line with
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.200]   the post office on your phone and you'll be able to pick up where you left off.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.560]   But that's, I've always seemed to me as though the, it was an odd product for Amazon
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.760]   to be building if they're interested in developing it the same way that Apple was developing
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   the iPod.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.640]   We definitely, we definitely want to make our money off of hardware.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.440]   It always seemed to me that they were building this because they wanted to jumpstart the market
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.680]   for DRM eBooks and create that store and then eventually, and somewhere on that big white
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.080]   board where they have their business plan, it says that.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.560]   And then after two years after we have every, ever, ever, ever, ever since we have the
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   electronic market absolutely locked up, then we start licensing this technology to anybody
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.160]   who wants to build a desktop reader or mobile reader.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:40.240]   Unfortunately, I cannot so far get Amazon to talk to me about this and be a little bit
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.000]   more specific so that I know exactly what they're talking about.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.800]   But I'm absolutely confident that we're going to see DRM Amazon content on iPhones, on other
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.200]   devices sometime in the future.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.840]   So that's really intriguing application of this.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.640]   And I think, you know, there's no, I can think of no reason why you wouldn't want to do this
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.080]   from Amazon's point of view except maybe you want to send them to sell more kindles.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.920]   But really that's not the kindle is just a jumpstart for them of selling eBooks.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.000]   They don't care, I don't think, if it's on the iPhone or Kindle.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.840]   Of course, you always have to, this comes right back to that Apple thing.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.040]   You got to get Apple's permission to put this on the App Store.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:22.680]   Well, part of the whole selling proposition for the Kindle and that whole ecosystem is
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:27.600]   that built in wireless just sort of, it just sort of works.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.240]   You feel like, and I don't have one, but you know, I watched the videos on Amazon.com
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.440]   and it seems cool to be able to have your newspaper waiting for you in the morning.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.920]   So the time comes into my...
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   That's really cool.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.200]   And I'm considering getting a Kindle too because of that.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.760]   You know, I would love to have this stuff just ready.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.840]   And I searched like I was saying I'm on this whole Google Analytics kick.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.960]   They have Google Analytics books in there.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.480]   Now, I wonder how they look with, you know, the illustrations and all that with the screen.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.720]   The new screen, especially, is better grayscale.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.800]   So they're going to look fine.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.400]   You're going to lose colors all you're going to lose.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.360]   And I have started to get computer books.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:09.000]   I wanted a book on PowerShell and the nice thing is you download the first chapter for
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   free.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   You could see if this is the book you want.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.640]   And I've done that a number of times with competing specialty books.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.800]   And it's a great way to say, no, this isn't the one for me.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   This isn't the one for me.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   Oh, yeah, this one.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   I like how he's writing.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   I like that.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   How's that experience though?
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.280]   Because I'm used to learning from a regular book.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   I know.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   I don't think it's much different.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   Well, same thing.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.520]   He put the Kindle next to the computer.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.640]   In fact, I think it's very similar.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.120]   In fact, because it's indexable, searchable, you can go on, you can highlight a thing and
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   go online with it.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.160]   I mean, I think in many ways it might even be a superior solution.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:45.280]   I used Safari books, which is an online site that O'Reilly and another, a number of Pearson
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.680]   and other publishers support with their books.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.080]   You could subscribe to a book there.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.520]   And because it's indexable and searchable, it's really a better way of, at least for technical
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.040]   books, of having technical books online.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   I think that's great.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.040]   I think that's great.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.040]   Huge.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   I mean, on the Kindle or on the Kindle?
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   On the Kindle.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   230,000 books.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   Wow.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   Okay.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   And this is the other thing.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.800]   Bezos is really, and boy, you know, if somebody else had said this, I would kind of laugh.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.080]   But if Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos say something, you kind of listen, he says, "We want to get
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.360]   every book ever published on here."
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Wow.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.880]   You think that's doable, Annie?
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.120]   I think so.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.280]   I mean, publishers are looking for--
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.960]   Authors Guild not withstanding.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.400]   I mean, again, publishers are looking for their future.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   And that's a big--
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.400]   Why would you?
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   I'm going to grab onto.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.400]   Right.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:33.360]   And there's just too much of an upside for them to ignore this.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.880]   Everybody-- they don't necessarily have to sell everybody a $300 reader because more and
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.360]   more-- more and more people are volunteering to purchase devices that are perfectly suitable
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.960]   e-book readers on their own.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:47.880]   All they got to do is find a pipe that would connect the bookstore to that screen and they're
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.720]   in like Flynn.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   Very--
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   It's a good--
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.720]   Go ahead, Dan.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.480]   As I'm going back to Andy's point though, the sort of the advanced usability side of things
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   and wouldn't it be nice to have this singing with this and starting off?
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.760]   Doesn't that strike you as a sort of thing that Apple would do to sort of walk into an
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:10.040]   established provider of this sort of content with a new device and with absolutely superb
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   usability?
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.480]   It just strikes me that it's sort of they all lining themselves up to make themselves
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   open to that sort of--
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   It's their model.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   They've got movies, got music, got TV shows, books.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   They've got audio books.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:27.360]   The only question in my mind is do they want to be beholden to Amazon to be the content
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.760]   provider for all that?
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.400]   Or do they want to say, ooh, nice market you have here.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.120]   Think we'll take in.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.760]   But the thing is Amazon is starting to really run away with this.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.080]   So if Apple's got to move to make in that regard, they're going to have to make it.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.760]   There's been rumors for a number of years that I've heard from different people who
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.560]   might-- I don't like passing on rumors.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:50.360]   I'm only passing this on because it's sort of interesting that you keep hearing about
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.160]   lots and lots of books.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   By the pallet load arriving at Apple.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   I've heard about it, too.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.120]   Which sort of makes you think that, oh, so they're just OCRing books just as a matter
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.120]   of course to build up.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   I didn't hear this.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   This is going back a lot, though.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.440]   This is 18 months to years ago, isn't it?
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.760]   I mean, basically the bones of the rumor is that, again, just trucks keep coming in and
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.320]   just dumping just piles and piles and piles of books.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.960]   And it's not as though Apple has a huge community library for its people.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:26.560]   It's just that trucks come in, books come in, and wherever they go, people don't know
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.720]   where they go.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:31.560]   And again, that usually fuels rumors that Apple's working on an e-book reader or they're taking
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.160]   a look at it or just somebody figured out a way to put all of their book buying habits
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   on the expensive rule.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   How do you get it?
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   How do you get it?
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.320]   Steve Jobs, presidential library.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.600]   We're trying to figure out a way to make PowerPC 680030 processors work inside.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.920]   This is going to take us another $40 million, I think.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   We're also going to need another building and about 40 million bookshelves from IKEA.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.840]   But it's essential for IC development.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.600]   But yeah, I mean, Apple has to be working on this at some level.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.120]   It's starting to become very, very clear that if Apple wants to do the things that they
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:10.840]   typically do best, which is to emphatically make a technology relevant and usable and
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.680]   important, it's not going to be by trying to create a brand new store.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.280]   It's going to be by supporting the Kindle format and finding a way that these two can
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   coexist.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.400]   Apple doesn't like to have more than one set of hands in the same pie.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.480]   They like to have all five fingers in there at the same time.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.720]   So I don't know how that's going to shake out.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.480]   If Amazon wants to make a Kindle DRM book reader for the iPhone, and Apple's not going
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.320]   to allow that to happen only because at some point in the magical future, they decide that
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.720]   they might want to do themselves.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Wow.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.240]   That's a really sucky thing to do to any book left.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.160]   On the other hand, competition is a good thing.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160]   Competition is a good thing.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.880]   But I'm a consumer.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.080]   I don't care who's in the sandbox, punching each other in the head.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.840]   I just want my solutions.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   Right.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   Amen.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.120]   Well, I think that's why users put up with DRM and other things.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.280]   If it's done subtly and we can live with it, we will.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.640]   I mean, think about it.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.280]   We had competition between Blueray and HD DVD.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.120]   The end effect for the user is that it's stalled HD movie development delivery for what?
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.120]   Three years.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   And now Blueray is flopping.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.400]   So that's the sad story on that one.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.760]   Although, and I think in the long run, consumers win on that and that because Apple is just
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.880]   going to go right ahead with downloadable movies and bye bye.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.240]   We don't need the media, physical media.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   All right.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.880]   We're going to take a break.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.240]   Oh, I did want to mention this iPhone application since I teased it.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.760]   It's a card counting application.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:48.920]   For those of you who would like to visit Vegas casinos and win every time, card counting,
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.800]   of course, is the blackjack technique of keeping track of where the deck is, how many
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.760]   face cards are left in the deck.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.440]   And you can really improve your odds significantly enough so that you could win all the time.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.960]   And I haven't looked at if you looked at this application, but looked at this application.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   I have not seen that.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   I like the idea.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.200]   I can't see that you could be having that on your lap in Vegas though.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   You can be on track.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.360]   That's in fact the story is that I'm not.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.360]   I'm not.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.640]   It's a stealth mode, doesn't it?
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   Oh, does it?
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.200]   Yeah, you can switch off.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.920]   You need to know where the buttons are on the screen.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.840]   I don't know how you actually see what's going on if you have it in stealth mode because
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.320]   the screen basically goes blank and then you can still control it.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.440]   So my problem with it is that the iPhone is a touch base interface and I'm not sure
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.640]   how you're going to operate with all your fingers broken like that.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640]   Exactly.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.040]   We're missing arms, right?
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.800]   Well, good news.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.480]   But that probably means the stealth mode is you will never again be able to bring an iPhone
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.840]   into a casino.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.640]   They'll just block them.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   That's it.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640]   Sorry.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   Gaming officials have said that we're just not going to allow them.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.800]   I mean, it was only a matter of time.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.680]   Northern California Indian casino found customers using the program leading to a bureau of gaming
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.720]   control notification.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.680]   Individual casinos are likely to have varying rules regarding cell phones or media players.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.600]   My suspicion is by buying your cell phone in the casino.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   What do you really?
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   How will they enforce that frisk everybody on the way in?
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.480]   Also, I mean, I think that a certain there's a certain demographic of casino patrons who
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.840]   own cell phones and have them with them.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.480]   I've never seen the numbers on this, but maybe they've already talked about gambling
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.000]   but many people walking into these things with some sort of phone that they're talking
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   already.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.680]   Well, maybe if you don't pull it out, you're OK.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.880]   Is it going to be like that scene in an unforgiven where like at the city limits, you have to
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.640]   sort of there's a big thing which is a cell phone here.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.320]   The render your cell phone or, you know, or little lead comes in and sends you a message.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.680]   I'm the sheriff in town and there can only be one cell phone.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.120]   You probably think I'm talking to English Bob.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.600]   I'm eating crap out of you.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   Nope.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   What I'm doing is I'm talking.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.440]   Send in the message to every bowl, legged, geek out there.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.040]   We don't allow cell phones in this city.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.920]   All right, we're going to take a break and get back to you with your picks of the week.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.120]   That's kind of a tradition here in Mac break weekly, probably the part of the show everybody
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.160]   fast forwards to don't fast forward through the ad though.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.640]   Because that's how we make a living here.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.880]   Mac break weekly, we don't want to lose yet another person to an actual job as we've lost
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.560]   Frederick Van Johnson.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.120]   Employment employment.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   We hate that.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.800]   That's why good thing in a recession.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.600]   That's why we've got sponsors.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.280]   This portion of the show brought to you by our friends at Citrix CITRiX.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280]   They do go to meeting.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   You know about go to meeting.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   What a great product that is.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.440]   Go to meeting allows you to turn your boring conference calls into something actually compelling,
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.520]   something exciting, something interesting.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   Go to meeting.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.840]   The idea of go to meeting is you install it on your computer.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:05:01.320]   In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com/macbreak, go to meeting.com/macbreak before
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.480]   I'm done talking because I'm a wordy cuss.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.680]   Before I'm done talking, you will be able to install go to meeting on your PC.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:14.680]   Now, with a couple of clicks of the mouse, you can start a meeting while you're on a call
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.600]   or send out invitations to a meeting.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.680]   People go to go to meeting.com.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680]   They don't have to install it.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.200]   By the way, the last thing I know you want to do on a sales call is force your client to
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.400]   jump through hoops to have a meeting with you about buying your product.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.400]   No, it's easy.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.800]   All you say, in fact, they clients love it.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.640]   You say, "Look, I want to show you the product.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.360]   I want to show you our PowerPoint presentation about what we could do for you or I want to
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.080]   work together with you on this.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.080]   Do me a favor.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.280]   Go to your front of your computer right now.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   They go there.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   You give them a meeting ID.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   It's like a phone number.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.040]   I think it's a six digit number.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.400]   They enter it in.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.200]   All of a sudden, they're seeing your screen.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   It's very cool.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.840]   Clients go, "Wow, that's cool."
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.600]   You say, "Now, let me show you this."
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.640]   It makes a boring old conference call, something exciting.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.240]   They'll put down the trism and start listening to you.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.320]   Eliminate business travel that costs so much and wastes so much time.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.440]   Make your conference calls interesting.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.640]   Go to meeting works Mac and Windows, by the way.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   Maybe you didn't know that.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.760]   It's not a Windows-only product Mac or Windows, both your and end clients.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.840]   It's great for training, collaboration.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.960]   I've used it many times to work together with people on speeches or writing.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.960]   And it's just fantastic.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.600]   It's used in businesses everywhere.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.800]   Find out how it can help your business.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:33.920]   Get 30 days absolutely free by going to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.040]   You might have heard of other products that do something similar.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.320]   Believe me, I've tried them all.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.960]   This is the most affordable, one low flat monthly rate, very affordable.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.120]   I think it's less than 50 bucks a month.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.760]   And as many meetings as you want, as often as you want.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:53.000]   Plus, it's fast and it's simple and it's easy and you don't need the IT department to
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.960]   give you a hole in the firewall or give you permit.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.360]   I mean, it's very straightforward.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.160]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.080]   Thank them for their support when you visit them.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.440]   Say, I heard it on Macbreak.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.800]   Actually, if you go to that URL, I guess that's what you're saying.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   We really love them.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   We thank them for their support.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.160]   They've also signed up for another two quarters.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.040]   So we're happy to hear that.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   Macbreak Weekly will survive.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.680]   To live another day.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.880]   No cubicle for leave.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.520]   No cubicle.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.960]   You notice we'll be able to get the meat this week.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   I'm going to have an egg for breakfast on Friday.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.680]   That's what that's right, children.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.120]   We're going to be using the shrimp packet with the Ramen noodles today.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.920]   We have shrimp packet.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.440]   We have shrimp packet.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   Don't have to save that for dinner.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.120]   You notice how I cleverly didn't have any Drobo ads in the show today?
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.480]   All of your stuff on a Drobo.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   Not one.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.400]   You're killing me there, Leo.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.040]   So if you decided where you're going to put the tattoo, you're going to go bicep.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.200]   You're going to go tramp stamp.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.240]   I don't think it's forehead.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.240]   I don't think it's forehead.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   Right.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.480]   Well, no, that's a little bit goldenpallast.com.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.800]   I'm sure that--
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.200]   I'm sure that--
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Friends of Friends is a smart guy.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.720]   I'm sure you negotiated them down from forehead.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.280]   Bicep.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.040]   Is this going bicep?
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.240]   Bicep's good.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.220]   And I was thinking about putting Drobo instead of just--
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.220]   Oh, I like that.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.220]   Are they going to call you that?
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.380]   Because I can say that on your card.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.540]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.580]   What about these expensive cards you printed up?
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.780]   Those--
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.540]   Leo.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.640]   Drobo's got a FrederickVin.com.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.300]   We'll continue on in full force.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.060]   I'm just going to write Drobo.com on the back.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.140]   No, no, I can't ruin it.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.220]   This is a dollar card.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.860]   This is-- you can't write on this.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.340]   Fire, don't worry about there.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:31.860]   Don't worry about it.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:32.340]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:32.940]   There's his phone number.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.700]   Let's not show that.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.100]   There you go.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.060]   You can see the phone number.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:35.860]   Oh, really?
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.500]   That's a grand central number.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.100]   Oh, so does it make control that?
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.540]   I control the number.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.380]   Is that a beautiful card?
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.820]   All that you see in here.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.460]   Did you get Drobo to make another one for you?
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.380]   This is Drobo?
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.020]   I wish I had cards like that for Drobo.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.140]   Yeah, see, they have standard cards like our Twit cards.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:49.740]   They're just regular--
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.340]   They're good cards.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:52.740]   They're good.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.540]   They don't got to fuck each.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:53.980]   They're not that good.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.060]   And they're not a buck each.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   Not a buck each.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:56.460]   No.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.700]   They've got a business to run.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.820]   But they charge less for a Drobo than I do to shoot a wedding.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.620]   So--
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.980]   There you go.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.780]   There you go.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.540]   It's much less to back up the data from that wedding
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.460]   than it is to actually shoot.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.220]   You know who else they should hire is Scott Born.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:10.700]   Scott Born.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:10.900]   Scott Born.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.180]   I've never seen a bigger Drobo fanatic than Scott Born.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.140]   He's amazing.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.740]   Scott is in love with his Drobo.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.780]   So do you have a pick for us this week, Mr. Fred?
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.300]   I do.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   Like I mentioned earlier, I am on this whole Google AdWords
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.300]   AdSense analytics--
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.500]   Is that for your website?
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.220]   It's for my website, and it's for the Drobo website as well.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.340]   I'm just trying to get myself immersed into it
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.180]   to understand how to read those teas.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:32.700]   We use it.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.500]   It's great.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:33.940]   It is.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.420]   But did you know that there's an iPhone application out?
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:37.920]   No.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.180]   To read your Google Analytics account.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:40.680]   OK.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.460]   And it's amazing.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.460]   Something's in the search right now.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:42.960]   What do I--
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.260]   It's amazing.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.180]   What do I-- what do I install?
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.420]   It's called Analytics App.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.300]   And it lets you look at your dashboard, today's visitors,
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.580]   traffic overview, everything.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.420]   That's awesome.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.900]   Even your ads and stuff.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.260]   So how your ads, your campaigns are performing,
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.980]   everything is right in the palm of your hand.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.580]   So--
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.780]   Is it from Google?
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.620]   No, it's not.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:07.180]   It's released by a company called InBlossom, LLC.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.060]   It was released on February 3rd.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.420]   Oh, it's so brand new.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.700]   And it's amazing.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.100]   So far, I'm in love with it.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.900]   I'm searching for it and installing it right now.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.380]   Install it.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.100]   And it's free.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.180]   It is not free.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:18.680]   No.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.620]   It is $6.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:20.620]   That's worth it.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:21.120]   It's worth it.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.120]   It's so worth it.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.460]   If you're doing any measure of this stuff,
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.180]   it's worth it to have this stuff with you all the time.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.180]   I have analytics on every one of our site.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.380]   For those who don't know, it's a little JavaScript stub
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.020]   that you could put-- you usually put it in the header,
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.540]   so it appears on every page.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.620]   And then every time somebody goes to your page,
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.180]   as long as they have JavaScript enabled,
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.420]   they will add that stick.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.020]   And boy, you get stuff like heat maps, everything.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:42.820]   I mean, it's incredible.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.540]   Yeah, it'll track repeat visitors,
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.780]   how long they stay on your site,
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.820]   how long they stay before they bounce off, everything.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.660]   So if you wanted to get to that level of detail
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.740]   about what your visitors are doing,
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.300]   Google Analytics is just bar not amazing.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.380]   And it's free.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.900]   And this app is $6.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.300]   But while you're out and about, you
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.940]   can keep track of what your sites are doing.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.100]   I got a call on the radio show this weekend
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.980]   from a guy whose wife uses it on her site.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.300]   And he said, but the numbers are lower on the analytics
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.140]   than they are from, you know, Web-O-Lizer,
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.100]   or one of the stats packages that we run on our server.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.700]   And I was a little-- I couldn't figure it out.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.100]   And then somebody in the chat room said, well, wait a minute.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.420]   That's because of robots.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.780]   Analytics doesn't count the spiders that
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.060]   are visiting from all those search engines.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.140]   But of course, AWS and Web-O-Lizer
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.460]   do because their page use their hits.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.500]   But because those robots don't use JavaScript,
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.660]   they don't get counted analytics.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.860]   And you know, it's really true.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.740]   The difference between with and without robots is huge.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.900]   But you want without robots.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.060]   They shouldn't count.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.940]   Unless you're telling advertisers your numbers or something.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.420]   And Blake.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.940]   No, we would never do that.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.420]   Never.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.340]   It would be wrong.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:52.900]   Never.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.460]   No, we don't.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:58.060]   Fortunately, our numbers for the podcast come from PodTrack.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:58.900]   And they really do.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.500]   Because advertisers demand it.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:05.220]   Drobo is not going to say to us, well, give us your largest
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:05.740]   number.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.900]   They're going to say, give us your best qualified number.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.580]   So they-- PodTrack actually matches it against an IP
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.100]   database.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.500]   It's unique IPs and all that stuff.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500]   Oh, it has to be.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.260]   Oh, it has to be, unfortunately.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.860]   Because it really does dwindle the numbers.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.420]   But they do that.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.420]   Totally.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:19.900]   Great.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.780]   Good pick.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.020]   I just downloaded and installed it.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.420]   So thank you very much.
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:24.020]   You are welcome.
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.380]   It's called Analytics App.
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.380]   And it's $6 from the iTunes store for your iPhone.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.100]   Andy Enaco.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:30.940]   Mr.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.740]   Ah, you got to pick for us today.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.900]   I got to pick for you.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.020]   I got a iPhone app.
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:41.660]   It is an application called iStat from bajango.com.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.700]   E-J-A.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.980]   And it's a Nancy, G-O.com.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.020]   Bajango.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:46.700]   Bajango.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.740]   It does two cool things.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:53.340]   It is a system status application for the iPhone
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.420]   so that if you want to leave something on your desk
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.180]   to make it look like you've got a Star Trek Tri-Corder.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.140]   It'll create graphs and charts and animated things.
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.740]   They basically tell you about the status of everything
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.260]   going on inside your iPhone network traffic, memory usage,
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.420]   IP addresses, things like that.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.700]   And it has a trace root and has a who is utility.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.860]   Which is very cool.
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:12.940]   And really, really, very nice.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.140]   And for Buck99, on top of everything else,
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.340]   it's very, very pretty.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.780]   And I think that iPhone applications
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.300]   are supposed to be pretty and cool looking
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.820]   because that is actually a user feature.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:25.700]   But it also has a free desktop client
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.980]   that you can get for your Mac.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.140]   And if you have this little tiny little helper app
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.340]   running on any Mac you want, now you
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.260]   can do system status on any Macintosh that's running that app.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.260]   Wow.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.900]   So right now, for instance, I'm downstairs in the office.
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.860]   Upstairs, I started a DVD ripping upstairs in the living
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.980]   room, the TV room.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.220]   And right now, I've got a little full screen display that
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.500]   shows me everything that's going on in that machine.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.620]   And I can see by the graph, because it
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.300]   looks just like the console utilities and system status
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.700]   utilities that you have on the desktop here.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.300]   I see a moving graph of CPU users that tells me that, yes,
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.820]   it is still doing all that heavy math.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:05.020]   So it's definitely not done ripping that DVD yet.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.740]   I've got-- it'll monitor multiple machines at the same time.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.780]   So I've also got it checking in on my previous Mac book,
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.740]   the Black Mac book, has acquired--
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.820]   it's acquired sudden shutdown syndrome
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.020]   for like a month ago.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.660]   And I don't know whether it's up or down.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.860]   If I want to know whether it's actually running or not,
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.540]   I can just basically tap into this application and see that,
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.500]   no, I see CPU usage up.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.300]   I see this happening.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.500]   I see that happening.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.060]   So yes, I know that this new machine is still running.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.620]   But it's just that coolness of--
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.020]   so I've given you very good practical reasons why
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.060]   you want to spend $1.99 for this application.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.420]   And they're good, and they're solid,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.900]   and they're very, very practical.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.700]   But I have to admit that a lot of it is just saying,
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.980]   of course, as administrator, I wonder
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.380]   what the CPU temperature is of my server, 176 degrees.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.660]   Very good, very good.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.180]   I have no need to be concerned.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.060]   I've got 632K built kick-kill, just a second up and down.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.020]   You're good, good, good.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.420]   Under-- excellent, excellent.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.180]   Apparently, it works very, very easily on your local subnet.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.820]   So all the machines that are inside your office
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.500]   are in your house.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.620]   It'll work just great.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.780]   If you wanted to work outside of that,
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.260]   you do have to do a little bit of finagling
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.340]   to make it work.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.660]   Just the standard stuff that anybody who understands
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.700]   how networks and firewalls work will easily make it--
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.180]   it'll get it working very, very easily.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.420]   But it's not something as simple as just activate back
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.300]   to my Mac and it'll find the client all the way back--
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.580]   all the way back 3,000 miles away from your hotel
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.660]   or anything like that.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.980]   But it's very, very flexible, very, very useful.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.140]   And again, anybody who complains that $1.99
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.340]   is too much to spend on this.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.180]   I need to have that iPhone application running on your iPhone
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.060]   that lets me reach in through my iPhone screen and slap you.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.860]   Because--
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:47.860]   --this full--
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.900]   That's called iSlap.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.460]   And it is $1.99 in the iPhone.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.020]   You know, it's on sale because it was $2.99.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.420]   I just went to bajango.com.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.220]   And actually, I've already installed it handy.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.980]   I just installed it in the application on the desktop.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:06.980]   So now I've just spent $7 on this show.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.100]   Do you want to-- you got anything more I can buy?
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.340]   I'm Don McAllister.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:10.740]   I don't know.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:11.580]   I have a go, yeah.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.780]   And right, my pick.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.780]   It's actually two picks.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.700]   I can buy two things.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.940]   But they work in conjunction with one another.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.860]   And what it is, as you know, MacMani is coming up very,
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.460]   very quickly.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.660]   We're off to Asia.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.500]   And son of a--
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.820]   Hey, you and I are off to Asia.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.740]   Me too.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.980]   Yeah, Andy.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.940]   Sorry, Fred.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.140]   You know, Drobo.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.300]   No Drobo marketers allowed on the cruise.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.780]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.540]   Two people.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.140]   That was-- I mean, I love places in iPhoto.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.700]   And you cannot automatically-- I've not
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.180]   got a GPS enabled camera.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.180]   So I know you can assign GPS coordinates manually to photos.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.340]   But when we're over there, we're going to take a lot of photos.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.220]   And it's not really going to be feasible to actually
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.100]   geotag on my photos manually.
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.100]   So sort of thing-- I thought I'll buy the bullet,
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.740]   and I'll buy a GPS enabled camera,
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.220]   and send a tweet out for some recommendations.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:02.620]   And I got a few suggestions, which involve not buying a camera.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.580]   Basically, what you can do is you can turn your iPhone
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.140]   into a GPS tracker and record your location
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.300]   using this little application.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:10.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.140]   And then use another application, which I think
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.060]   you've mentioned before, which is who did Geo?
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:14.560]   Yes.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.060]   And combine photos with the GPS information,
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.500]   and then put them into iPhoto.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.100]   And boom, you've got GPS coordinates on all your photos.
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.140]   And it's a simple little application on your iPhone
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.700]   called Trails.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.660]   It's £1.79.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.660]   So what's that about?
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.020]   $2.50.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.300]   And basically, it just turns your iPhone.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.100]   It uses the GPS functions of your iPhone
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.060]   and turns it into a tracker.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.860]   So you switch it on, you start the application.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.180]   You can switch off the Wi-Fi and the 3G as well,
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.300]   if you want to conserve battery life.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.740]   Just leave it running.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.940]   It records all the waypoints where you are.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.020]   And then you just email that file to your--
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.740]   to a standard email account, pull the file off, load it
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.260]   into GeoTiger, load your photos in, and it's done.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.860]   So it's not running in the back.
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.260]   It's not allowed to run in the background.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.580]   So do you have to keep it upfront?
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.220]   You have to leave it stoned.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.700]   Yeah, it will actually close the screen
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:05.980]   now to conserve battery life.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.300]   What will happen is you can leave it on.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.820]   So if you're taking photos for half an hour,
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.100]   you can take half an hour with the photos,
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.220]   and then switch it off.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220]   Yeah, and then it stops.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.220]   And then it stops.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.420]   And then you get to a new location, switch it on.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.780]   But I did a little road trip.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.300]   I actually did a show about this.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.220]   It's actually a members show.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.220]   But one of those-- I'll do a special version
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.980]   so that Matt Brig week, people can have a look at it.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.140]   So I'll put a link on my website,
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.820]   and I'll send you a link for the show notes.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.340]   Thank you.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.900]   But I went on a little road trip to Anfield and Goodison,
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.020]   which is the two big football stadiums
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.260]   that we have here in Liverpool.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.460]   And just did a mini road trip and used trails,
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.780]   took some photos, came back to the studio,
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.100]   put it all together, made a show out of it.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.420]   And it works fantastically well.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.100]   So it's just a brilliant way to GPS tag your photos
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.980]   and get them into iPhoto and have them all in the proper locations.
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:51.500]   This is great.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:57.100]   I carry a little GPS design for this.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   It's just like a key fob thing, this design.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.820]   Yeah, but they're about $90.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.180]   They are.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.420]   They're expensive, yeah.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.340]   Yeah, it's like $2.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.620]   So if you're going to get to the US--
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.380]   It's $2.99 in the US, yeah.
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:06.980]   Right, OK.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.580]   If you're going to be doing a lot of tagging,
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:09.580]   it might be worth getting one of those,
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.140]   and you just leave those on and forget about them.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.820]   But if you don't want to go to that expense
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.580]   and you just want to do some critical photos
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.620]   and you've got your iPhone, I don't think it works too well
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:20.420]   with the iPod touch because the Wi-Fi triangulation
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.940]   for GPS is now.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.460]   Especially in China.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.300]   Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.620]   But this will work worldwide.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:27.860]   This will work in China.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.580]   It should do.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.420]   Yeah, it's a standard GPS.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.500]   So you don't need Wi-Fi.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.940]   You can actually switch all that off.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.500]   The application itself is really neat in
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.460]   that while you're actually recording your waypoints,
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.500]   it will access Google Maps.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.420]   So you can see exactly on Google Maps where you are.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.300]   It's like that.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.140]   And Huda Geo is a great little program
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.820]   because what these programs do is they write out a file
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.980]   in a standard format that then you import into Huda Geo.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.700]   And Huda will then match it up to your pictures on time, right?
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.900]   So you have to make sure your camera time's accurate.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.580]   It works really well.
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.700]   So that's trials.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.180]   Well, trials are rather not trials.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.020]   I like that.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.540]   It's trials.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.500]   Yeah, you were channeling Michael Kane for a moment there.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500]   It's trials.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500]   Trials.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.460]   Have you checked that motion next GPS?
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.660]   Is that also an iPhone app?
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.980]   It's also an iPhone app.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.020]   It's my favorite.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.860]   They're navigation apps that are for car navigation and cool maps
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.820]   and cool stuff like that.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.340]   And then there are applications that turn your iPhone
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.220]   into a Garmin GPS, meaning some of us
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:37.300]   designed to talk to satellites and translate satellites
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.540]   into coordinates and let you save waypoints
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.740]   and let you save paths and all that other sort of cool stuff.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.540]   My favorite is motionexgps from motionex.com.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.340]   They make two of my favorite programs
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.140]   that are separated very, very far apart.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.940]   One of them is a really sophisticated GPS navigator program.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.900]   The other one is a poker dice game.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.420]   I have to think there's a husband and wife team
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.540]   where the wife is more scientifically motivated
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.260]   than the guy who just likes to gamble.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.700]   I don't know how I would feel about the same brain,
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.980]   having those same two priorities.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.580]   But I assume that it would work the same way.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.060]   I only started using it a few weeks ago
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.660]   and I've never used it for geotagging.
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:18.180]   But it also--
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:18.500]   That's the issue.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.340]   Will it save out into that standard format file?
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:24.420]   Well, it does work with Google Earth.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.180]   So the cool thing that both these apps do
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.420]   is you turn it on.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.540]   You basically say, please keep track of where I'm going.
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.260]   You'd go for a nice walk wherever
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.860]   in the woods in the city, wherever.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.140]   And then when you get back, you export that file,
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.260]   put it into Google Earth, and it will overlay your entire path
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.140]   moments by moment on there.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.900]   I assume that it would work, but I haven't actually tried it.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.420]   OK.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.060]   It uses GPX files, doesn't it?
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.780]   That's the standard file that you need to make sure
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.340]   that it will output .GPX file.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.700]   So who requires that standard file to import?
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.060]   That's right.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.540]   And then once you've imported into who to do it.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.420]   Once saved, the plot of track can be shared with others
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.380]   via email while viewing in Google Earth, Google Maps,
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.100]   or any GPX capable application.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.140]   That's cool.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.740]   Well, the nice thing with the geo is once you get your GPS data
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.700]   and you put your photos in, it will tag them all.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:14.740]   You can do it preview as well.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.580]   You can access the maps from within who to geo.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.460]   And when you're happy, it doesn't overwrite the original file
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:19.980]   as well.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.460]   So you can sort of create a second file with your GPS
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.500]   information on, and then load that into my photo.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.180]   And it's done, basically.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.060]   What do you use--
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:31.580]   Frederick, you must use something to add a GPS data to your--
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.860]   You know, I don't, because I don't do that much.
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:34.460]   Doing a wedding.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.100]   You don't really need to know where it is.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.700]   Yeah, and models wedding, I don't need
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.740]   to know where it was.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.340]   For travel photography.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.500]   And then especially since Flickr's--
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.020]   I will.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.140]   I think for me, because like I was saying earlier,
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.820]   I'm a consumer.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.140]   I want this stuff in my camera.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:50.740]   Absolutely.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.180]   I want it just to work.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.820]   I want it to be a menu item in the camera
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.220]   that I can switch on and off.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.700]   I want it to be like Bluetooth.
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.420]   It's just there, and it works reasonably well.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.260]   Because I'm at the core of a photographer.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.660]   And I don't want to get into OK.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.500]   I got to load who I got to match up the Gmail.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.860]   Well, that's why I use this.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:10.740]   So this is the quartz-- or Q-Star rather, GPS recorder.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.260]   And you just put that on your belt,
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.700]   and you turn it on, and it tracks your hole as you walk around,
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.820]   and then you load it into it.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.940]   But these are all the same idea.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.300]   And you're right.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.260]   It's an extra step, and you have to launch Houdogio.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.940]   The worst thing is--
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.620]   and I don't have you solved this time of chemistry.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.020]   It doesn't work with raw photos.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.700]   So you've got to import JPEGs.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.700]   Done.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.460]   And then--
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.740]   But you're going to upload JPEGs to Flickr and other places
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:30.740]   anyway.
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.940]   Or Facebook.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.580]   And with the new terms of service.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.100]   We'll talk about that.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:35.620]   I don't know.
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.620]   Actually, you know what?
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.500]   We're going to do that one on Net at Night.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.540]   Sarah Lane and I are going to talk about these new terms
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.820]   of service from Facebook.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.460]   And then she's going to try to talk me out of deleting
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.420]   my Facebook account.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:46.780]   Because I'm--
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.820]   Scott Borne has already done that.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.340]   Yeah, no he did.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.540]   I'm this close to doing it.
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.100]   But there's reasons I don't want to do it,
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.500]   so we're going to have to talk it out.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.100]   I think she's going to have to talk me off the ledge, though.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.420]   Can I have all your friends before you delete it?
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.540]   You don't.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:01.740]   You don't want my friends.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:03.820]   Pastates.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:04.260]   So--
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.940]   Drobo implicated in mass email spamming, can't they?
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.980]   Fake popular Facebook account.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   If all my friends suddenly say, you know, I don't know what
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.340]   happened, but you started playing this jingle every time
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.940]   I come to visit you.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.660]   Really likes his Drobo game.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.980]   It's just-- and there's Drobo pictures everywhere.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:25.300]   No, because you don't want Facebook to own Drobo, do you?
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.180]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.540]   But all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.060]   Thank you.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.540]   This is going to be my--
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.940]   That's my ringtone from now on.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:35.860]   This is a bliminal episode.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.140]   Actually, just before we move away from the Huda Geo thing,
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.900]   I'll just have a quick look.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.940]   And it says it does write GPS coordinates and other metadata
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:45.460]   to the tags of many image formats-- JPEG, RAW, BNG.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:45.980]   Excellent.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.740]   So they've added RAW now.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.940]   Looks as though they have to--
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.620]   But RAW doesn't have a standard tagging format.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.940]   So that's what I wonder how they would do that.
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.020]   Is it a--
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.140]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.620]   DNG will support it.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.500]   I convert everything to a DNG.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.620]   Because they're in Lightroom, right?
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.660]   So when I import, I import as DNG.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.700]   So presumably, there'd be a way to do that.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.020]   It's got DNG support, yeah.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.380]   Like for this Asia trip that you guys are going on,
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:12.340]   that I'm not going on because I'm not allowed to go on it.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.140]   You're not?
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.580]   I would use a GPS.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.780]   And I would want to absolutely know everywhere--
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.700]   Every place I'd been.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.060]   Because we're going to Korea, Japan, China, all over China.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:23.580]   Thank you.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.700]   I appreciate that stuff.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.060]   Don't--
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.420]   You still got some hopes to hold up because remember,
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.860]   we all still have to apply for our visas.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:31.340]   So--
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.300]   Do we have to get visas?
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.540]   Do we have to get shots?
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:37.460]   When China would definitely want to take a look at us
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.380]   before they let us into the country.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:38.940]   How do we do that?
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.140]   Did Captain Neil help us with that?
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:40.900]   How does that happen?
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.060]   Send us an email as a matter of fact,
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:45.660]   about three weeks ago saying that you can't do it
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.020]   until like 60 days before or whatever.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.220]   And here's the company that will process your visa for you.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.500]   And here's how to handle it.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.500]   And I see this as a no-lose situation because either I
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.420]   get to go to China or I get to put on my Twitter
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.420]   and put on my blog.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.060]   I have been designated as undesirable by the Chinese government.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:04.660]   They fear me.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.220]   This is my message of hope and freedom
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:10.300]   that I would deliver to the crushed masses.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.300]   I'm going to have to find that email.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.060]   Well, actually, I was going to say that I would raise the red banner
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.660]   revolution, but that already happened with the bad thing.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.420]   I would raise the green money on the green banner of capitalism.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:24.780]   So the cruise is almost sold out.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.180]   You're going to want to hurry.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.100]   It closes for booking March 1st.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:31.940]   And the entire ship is almost full.
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:35.820]   It's Macamania 9, Andy, Don, and I will be on it.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.900]   I'm sure others too.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.940]   I hope it's more than just the three of us.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:41.460]   I think Derek's story is awesome.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.540]   I'll raise Honka.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:44.860]   Derek's story is wonderful.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.860]   He's a great photographer.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.100]   That's awesome.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.180]   Now you're really feeling like that.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:50.020]   I really feel bad.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:50.500]   I feel like that.
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.540]   You said there's seas left.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.140]   I mean, you could go.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   And if you go to insightcruises.com quickly, hurry up.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.740]   July 11th through 17th for the cruise.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.980]   And then are you guys going to do the land portion?
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.740]   Because I'm going to do the week--
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.580]   Yeah, the week before.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:06.820]   Good.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.060]   Oh, Don, we're going to have fun.
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.780]   Well, there is an eclipse China like a week after.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.420]   Are you going to do the eclipse one?
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:14.820]   I have a--
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.540]   I wasn't going to, but I have various nerdy friends who--
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:23.780]   To my surprise, we're going to be going to China anyway.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.980]   Come with us, man.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:29.140]   We're going to guess you the eclipse.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.460]   It seems like sort of an overt statement
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.620]   that I don't intend to make saying, yeah, I know
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.500]   that I'm already going to be in China halfway around the world.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.260]   And I would only have to stay next to a couple of days
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:39.980]   to hang out with you.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.460]   But ooh, I don't know.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.140]   You got to go.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.060]   You're going to go to the eclipse.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.540]   I've always wanted to stare at the sun
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:49.180]   and not have my head slapped by a parent.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.060]   I've already seen, I think, a couple of total eclipses.
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.060]   And I know the astronomy buffs go to everyone they can,
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:58.300]   even if it requires traveling halfway around the world.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.860]   But it's cool, but I'm not going to--
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.620]   I mean, that's--
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.300]   A special pilgrimage to--
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.380]   Yeah, just to do that.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.340]   I just feel-- see, my big problem
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:10.540]   is that it's not like a week-long trip to China.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.540]   We have a limited amount of short time in China.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.820]   And it's like, how can I tell people that I've been to China
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.220]   and not have my picture taken on something--
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.220]   On the Great Wall.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.620]   But that's usually not the sort of thing
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.980]   that I like to do on these cruises.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.460]   I much rather I just go to a market and just hang out.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.140]   Right.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:31.260]   Now the day-- the week ahead land portion, which is--
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.260]   I'm sorry to say a little pricey, is really cool
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.420]   because we're going to Peking.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:42.180]   We're going to go see the Ishtashion.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:45.860]   And then we'll go to a small rural area
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.580]   to kind of get a sense of what it's like in the--
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.940]   in the out of the cities in China.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.980]   So we're really looking forward to that.
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.940]   And boy, Don, won't that be a great photo op?
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.060]   I mean, we're just going to--
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.380]   --is going to be such fun.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.340]   I'm going with my wife and she's desperate to see
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.020]   the terracotta army.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:58.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.500]   Sort of the one--
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.940]   Yeah, we're going to see the seeder.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.220]   So we hope you'll come with us.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:08.300]   It's insightcruises.com to find out more.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.420]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.220]   All right, time for my pick.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.380]   Then we'll wrap this thing up.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.780]   I do want to mention a blogo because that was a pick
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.700]   a couple of weeks ago.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.260]   And then I gave them a hard time two weeks ago saying,
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.380]   you know, I installed a blogo I really love.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.260]   It's from Drink Brain Juice.com.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.820]   It's a beautiful application for blogging.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:28.220]   And I'm using it, but I was a little perturbed because I could
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.540]   only-- I thought-- install it on one machine.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.260]   Turns out I wasn't reading the license correctly.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260]   I had already installed it on two.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.260]   And so at the time, you could only install it on two machines.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.660]   I felt like, well, you know, Mars edit.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.660]   Most other applications let me install it on all my Macs.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.700]   I'm not going to be using it on more than one.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.580]   Because I complained, they've increased that number
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.080]   of three.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.340]   And I think that's probably adequate.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.660]   I mean, three machines is good, right?
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.620]   You have more than three Macs?
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.260]   Nope.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.340]   Home, work, and laptop.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:54.740]   And laptop, yeah.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.860]   So that's very nice of them.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.540]   Friends, huh?
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.740]   But I have more than three friends.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.380]   That's what their point was.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.140]   That was kind of their point.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:07.100]   We don't want you to install it on every person's computer
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:07.500]   that you know.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.780]   It's really awesome.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.620]   So I just want to update you on that.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.260]   It's $25 BLOGO from DrinkBrain Juice.com.
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.940]   They have increased the license now to three machines.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.300]   And that solves my problem with that.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:18.780]   I just got to--
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.540]   There's a little picture on the right of the page there
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.180]   at the bottom right.
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.940]   There's a little icon on the--
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:25.500]   On the bottom--
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.580]   The BLOGO page.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.260]   On the BLOG--
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.420]   Oh, wait, there's me!
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.180]   Who's that guy?
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.580]   Well, it was a Mac break weekly pick.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:31.940]   That's nice.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.860]   We don't even have that badge, but they made that up.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.660]   And I like it.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.020]   I like it.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:36.540]   Look at that.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:39.300]   See, their graphic design is just superb.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.260]   They really know how to--
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.260]   A little dock down there.
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:41.900]   A little--
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.980]   And the camera and the camera and everything.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.500]   That's cool.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.740]   That docks us.
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.900]   I'll take that off.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:46.580]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.060]   There's a little--
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:47.580]   A little triangle.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:47.580]   A little--
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:48.580]   A little--
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:49.780]   Active application.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.700]   So I don't know if I'm going to get anything like that
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:52.220]   for this pick.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:53.940]   In fact, I haven't even used this pick.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.100]   It just-- I just found out about it.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.060]   And I'm pretty darn excited about it,
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:01.620]   but I have to-- you know, I'm going to give you it as a pick,
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.020]   but suggest that you try it, but it may or may not work for you.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:11.020]   And you know that we're big fans of Hulu,
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.060]   and we're big fans of Netflix, and we're big fans
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.540]   of Front Row.
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.260]   Here is a free program from Google
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.380]   Code that will let you do Netflix and Hulu 3
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.060]   streaming right in Front Row.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.620]   So if you're using your home theater,
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.500]   if you're using Front Row as your home theater application
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:31.980]   on your Macintosh, this is a plugin called Understudy.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.300]   Still in development, I hear there are some bugs,
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.460]   but they're well documented.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.540]   And since this is absolutely free,
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.740]   and what it does is absolutely desirable,
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.580]   this might be something you want to try to download.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.940]   I've downloaded it and put it on my Mac mini over here,
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.300]   which I do use Front Row on,
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.940]   but I haven't had a chance to use it before the show.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:49.900]   So this is Understudy, a front row plugin
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.940]   for adding streaming video from both Netflix and Hulu.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.500]   See, this is great, 'cause I wanted to watch Dollhouse,
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.780]   and it's on Hulu, but now I can just use my remote.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.700]   I use Boxy, and of course, that's one of the great things
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.260]   about Boxy, is that it's Hulu to your XBMC,
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.100]   but this is a few years in Front Row.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.940]   code.google.com/p/understudy.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:15.020]   And it is in version .5, so you can tell us,
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:18.180]   still got a little work to go, requires leopard.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.700]   And there's my pick of the week.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:24.220]   Our time is up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.900]   I really want to thank you, Frederick,
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.700]   for making the trek one last time up here.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.700]   It's great to see you, it brought me a nice bottle of wine.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.620]   - Yes, I did. - Where did I put the wine?
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:35.020]   - Oh, I drank it. (laughs)
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.500]   - I'm sorry to share. - That's what I was here with.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.860]   - Extra happy today, kids. - Yeah!
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:42.020]   - No, it's Franciscan Cab, that is so nice of you.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.180]   - Well, when Devorak comes in, we'll share it with him.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.220]   - There you go. - He likes a good, a good tipple.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:49.300]   (laughs)
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.260]   All the best with you at Drobo.
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.420]   - Thank you. - Just thank you.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.020]   - You're always a part of the family.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.580]   - Always. - Really appreciate everything.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.180]   - I told you I'm gonna make a cameo appearance
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.860]   and do the Kramer, bust in the door.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.420]   - Yay! - Okay, that's good.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.860]   I'll look forward to it.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.180]   People still can go to your website,
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.660]   you're still doing the photography, thinkfredrickvan.com
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.540]   and for E-D-E-R-I-C-K-V-A-N.com.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:11.260]   - Absolutely. - Thank you so much
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.660]   for being here, we appreciate it.
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:14.300]   You're the best, Fred Ruck.
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:15.780]   - Thank you for having me.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:17.740]   - Don McAllister too, we really love it
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.780]   when you can visit us all the way from Liverpool.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.420]   - Scree. - I need.
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.700]   - Go ahead, you want me to give the plug,
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.780]   don't you, screencast online.cuz it's,
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.620]   I'm not starting, I'm not gonna talk now!
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.700]   Screencastsonline.com, and you're gonna make
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.540]   that screencast available.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.300]   - Yeah, thank you. - Yeah, sure.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:37.220]   - Yeah, no problem, I'll put a link on my website
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.500]   and I'll also drop your links in,
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.380]   put it in show notes as well, so.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.180]   - Yeah, people should just go to screencastsonline anyway.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.740]   There are plenty of free screencasts
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.940]   and then you wanna get the extra stuff
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:48.260]   become a screencast online extra member
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:52.580]   and you'll get, there's over 200 HD video tutorials.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:54.900]   This guy has really, in fact, you were saying this,
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:59.460]   Fred, before we began, figured out how to make this work,
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.740]   make a living to him. - One of the first,
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:03.660]   the first person to figure out how to monetize
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.420]   the whole podcast industry. - Really, yeah.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:08.820]   - And the reason is, I think there's no doubt about it
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.660]   because what he makes is quality
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.980]   and people are willing to pay for quality.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.660]   Good stuff that really helps them.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:16.100]   - Yep, thank you. - Thank you.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:16.940]   - Thank you, Don.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.540]   Great to talk to you, screencastsonline.com.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.620]   Andy Inaco, who cannot confirm or deny his participation
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.820]   in anything. - Really, I really
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.660]   shouldn't have told you even that much.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.580]   (laughing)
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.860]   If you could just forget that I even discussed
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:36.260]   that I may not know, that I may or may not be
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.460]   the author of a authorized biography of Steve Jobs,
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.060]   that would help me out quite a bit
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.060]   'cause I don't want that rumor to go into play.
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.780]   I honestly don't. - Not a word.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.180]   - Yeah. - It's completely secret.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:52.180]   You can find out more about all of this at www.cwob.com,
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:55.020]   the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:57.660]   And I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.540]   We do encourage you to subscribe to the show
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.860]   if you're not getting it every week.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.820]   You can get it automatically by going to iTunes.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:05.540]   Just search for Twitch or Macbreak Weekly,
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.460]   except no substitutes.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.740]   It'll come into your iTunes every week
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.260]   and you can listen every week.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.860]   We are really glad that you listened this week.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.820]   I think you probably are too.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.660]   It was a fun show.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.500]   Thanks everybody.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.300]   Another Macbreak is broke.
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:26.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:41.040]   (upbeat music)
