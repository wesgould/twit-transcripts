[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers everything
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.640]   you'd like to know about those folks, those weird people
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.080]   down in Cupertino, California.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.800]   We know them as Apple Computer and here to my in studio.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.480]   To my right, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.880]   But look, we've also got some people via video cast,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.800]   including from Boston, Andy Naco, star of the late show
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.640]   with David Letterman.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520]   Or is it the cow that's the star of the late show
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.120]   with David Letterman?
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.080]   Well, I'm proud to say that I've been a guest of the sidewalk
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.560]   in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.240]   And you don't get much for that appearance,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.880]   but the exposure you get by being on the sidewalk,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.200]   especially on a hot day when Dave has the hose out
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.880]   and squirting people on camera.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.640]   Really, it's all part of a multi-level marketing campaign.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.280]   You're actually getting into the late show
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   as an audience member, is very akin to jury selection,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.880]   which we were just talking about,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.160]   because I was just doing my jury duty this morning.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.520]   That's where we're starting a little bit late.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.960]   It's very similar, 'cause they interview,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   you go through this line and there's a person,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.480]   there's people with clipboards, and they spotted me.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.680]   They said, "Oh, hi, Leo.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.840]   "We'll be putting you in the special VIP section."
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.680]   What does that mean?
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.240]   Well, they want all the people from Oklahoma
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.360]   sitting in the front, you know,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.840]   they're gonna go, "Yeah, Dave, I love you!"
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.800]   Holding up signed stuff.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.120]   And then media people are too.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   We're too jaded, so they put us up in the balcony,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.720]   way behind the cameras where you can't, you know.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   So--
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.400]   - That's the special section.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.240]   - No, that's the via.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360]   - That's actually the best section.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.520]   That's the only section of the audience
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.280]   where you can absolutely see anything's going on
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.640]   other than a cameraman's butt.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.560]   - That's probably true.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.280]   You do have a great view, and it's fun to watch a show
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.600]   like that get done.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.280]   They start on time, you know.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.520]   (laughing)
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   - I haven't learned that lesson, apparently.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.880]   - They broadcast on time, of course.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.000]   - I think they usually start on time.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.320]   Also joining us, Adam, angst the editor in chief
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.960]   for the last 20 years of the best Mac newsletter of all,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.880]   Mac, tidbits.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.720]   It's good to see you, Adam.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.880]   - Thank you, Leo.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.280]   I have to say, I've actually never been called for jury duty.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.120]   - Don't say that out loud.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.480]   - Sorry you were registered voter?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.880]   - Yeah, I am a registered voter.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.960]   And, you know, it's like I've been,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.520]   either been a couple of times when they've,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.760]   they've said, oh, you'll need to come for jury duty,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   and then they've canceled it.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.840]   - Yeah.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.680]   - 'Cause that the trial is off.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.080]   - Well, I've been, I've been in the pool three times,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.240]   but I've never been invited to go for a swim.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.280]   - I've only been in the pool once.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.240]   - I actually want to.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   They show, now they show this movie.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.080]   - Oh, what's it called?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.520]   It's like 12 jurors.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   - Yes, America.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.000]   - America.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.840]   - Your civic responsibility.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.120]   - Oh, really good thing.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.800]   And then they show you this whole thing.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.240]   It's really good, the video, it's like a 15 minute video
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.760]   on why it's a good thing to be a juror.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.080]   And I was in tears at the end of it,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800]   and, you know, but I cry at anything.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.760]   And it makes you want to be a juror,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.520]   'cause, you know, it's how our justice system works
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.360]   and all that.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.440]   So I actually wanted to be on this jury.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.640]   I have a feeling that generally when I say,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760]   oh, I'm a radio talk show host, they say,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.720]   yeah, thanks, see you later.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.960]   Because I don't think they want you to go on the air
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.200]   and talk about it, right?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.960]   That would be the last thing they would have.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.800]   (laughing)
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   - They would really want you.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.480]   - Yes, I'll be talking about this on the air.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.080]   - Well, as I am, as a matter of fact, right now,
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.000]   free promotion for the justice system.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.080]   (laughing)
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.120]   That's how I'm being, that's how I'm being.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.600]   - Just think of the exposure.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.440]   (laughing)
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.280]   - Think of the tweets.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.160]   Think of the tweets.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.360]   Think of the humanity.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.000]   This prosecutor is, do I do what he's talking about?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   - So, I don't want to make this the lawsuit edition,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600]   but I don't know how we avoid making it
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.520]   the lawsuit edition.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   - But you just came to jury duty.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   I mean, it just, that.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.100]   - Well, first of all,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.840]   Apple sixers all the time.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.680]   - Really?
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.120]   I mean, I hate it that this,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320]   and I have to say, if you haven't seen
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   this American life on software patents,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.640]   do see it because I think it explains why,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.680]   tech companies now are spending so much time in court.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   And I think all of that energy and money going to that
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   is really just kills innovation, something awful.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.520]   Apple has now succeeded in literally
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   stymying sales of the Galaxy tab in Australia.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.640]   This is via a negotiation,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.400]   at least until legal proceedings in that country
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.480]   in Australia are resolved.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.560]   So the court didn't do it, it was just part of the deal.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.120]   They're not gonna advertise the Galaxy tab 10.1 in Australia.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.800]   They're not gonna sell it,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.920]   or until the court or the lawsuit,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.640]   court says you can and the lawsuit is resolved.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.440]   This is the kind of thing Apple wanted to have happen
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.360]   in the US for all Galaxy devices,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.920]   including the phones and the tablets.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.880]   They got the International Trade Commission
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.560]   to say, yes, there's something wrong here,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   but it remains to be seen if they'll be able to get that stopped.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.200]   And then HTs. - It's hard to get to the book.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.520]   Go ahead.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.880]   - I was gonna say it's hard to get to the bottom of it
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   because Samsung subsequently said that
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   they don't believe that these proceedings are gonna delay
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.360]   extended rollout into the Pacific in Asia.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.840]   So on the one hand, they're saying that they're gonna
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   cooperate with Apple to try to resolve whatever issues they have.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.800]   On the other hand, they're trying to tell stockholders,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.680]   believe me, we have over 800 pre-orders
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   and we will be shipping off maybe even a thousand of these.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.880]   That's the truth isn't it?
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.480]   It really doesn't hurt them that much
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.840]   to not sell the thing 'cause it's not been selling anywhere.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.400]   - Wouldn't Blackberry love to have that excuse to say?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.040]   Well, we were gonna take over the entire industry this year,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.840]   but oh, we had to dilocate this lawsuit,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.920]   so it couldn't do it all like this.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.080]   - Yeah, now HTC, who's also being sued,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.920]   it was HTC that the ITC said was guilty
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.720]   of infringing of Apple's patents.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.520]   The chief executive HTC Peter Cho says,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.200]   "It's a mere distraction.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.240]   "At an investor conference Friday, he says,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.960]   "the company will grow revenue.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.840]   "We're confident that we will not be affected by Apple's
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.680]   "law suit and I guess they feel like they're gonna win this."
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.240]   When I imagine Samsung does too,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.280]   or they wouldn't have agreed to the delay, yeah.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.960]   - I guess I would say it's a big distraction.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.800]   - Not to.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.640]   - No, you cannot call it a distraction.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.400]   - Well, and I think that one of the things about it is,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.360]   is that it, I think the challenge for a lot
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.280]   of Android manufacturers is if these are successful,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   once you have legal precedence,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.120]   it's gonna cause a lot of trouble for everyone.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.960]   - Well, and that's the I-end-roying point.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.360]   - Usually with patent trolls,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.200]   that's the strategy used to go after the low-hanging fruit
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.960]   and get a few decisions under your belt,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.360]   which gives you both money and precedent,
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.120]   and then you can go after the bigger and bigger ones,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.360]   and ultimately it feels to me like Apple would like
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.400]   to go after Android itself via Google.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.800]   - Well, my question is, is Apple gonna try
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.760]   to just stop sales, or are they gonna try to get royalties?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   - I mean, 'cause there's--
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.520]   - Well, in the long run, that's what they want, right?
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.120]   How much per handset do they get now from Microsoft?
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.360]   I mean, they would like to just have, you know,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   an extra $100 a handset from all these Android companies, right?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.240]   Why not?
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   - Right.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.480]   - Isn't that usually where these are going?
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.320]   I mean--
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.520]   - I think that Apple's thing is,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.000]   they don't want anyone else to do it.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.840]   I mean, I think that they,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   I don't think that they necessarily,
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.040]   I think whatever royalty they're gonna give--
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.320]   - They don't care about the license,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.160]   they're not, I don't think so.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.760]   - Yeah, I don't think Apple's really interested
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.600]   in the royalties.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.440]   - Yeah, they make so much--
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.720]   - This is something sound like Apple.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.920]   - So, Adam, you're thinking that,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.400]   unlike most patent cases,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.080]   this isn't about getting a license fee.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.920]   You and--
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.640]   - Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.280]   I mean, if you just look at what Apple's done over the years,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.480]   they're really interested in making their money
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.280]   by selling their products.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   That they don't really,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.120]   they don't wanna do bundling deals,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.280]   they wanna do marketing of other stuff.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.600]   They just wanna sell what they make.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.280]   And I'm sure if there was sort of no alternative,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.680]   but to either get the royalty money or not, they take it.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   But I just don't see that as a major aspect
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.160]   of Apple's business model.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.360]   You certainly don't hear them talking
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.120]   in the analyst calls about all the money
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.520]   that they've managed to get from their patent portfolio.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.200]   - Well, in that case, they're going for blood, I mean.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.400]   - Yeah, then no Apple wants blood, there's clear.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.720]   (laughing)
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.280]   - Well, most of their patent work, patent filings,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.040]   they haven't been doing that sort of BS sort of,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.080]   well, we hold a patent on block by block,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.600]   BitShift technology for compressed stream network video.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.680]   And because you stream some video, we go with some money.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.760]   They're mostly going after,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.320]   every time they go after Samsung, for instance,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.600]   it's always been, your phone looks way too much
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.160]   like an iPhone, we need you to knock that off right away.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.280]   - That's the right of your other stuff.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   - Well, that's the, or at least,
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.800]   I've been talking to a couple of IT lawyers
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.040]   'cause this is way, way, way above my head.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.000]   And they said that there's a way that you position yourself
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.400]   strategically, they both of them are talking about this
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.840]   as though it were a military act.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.680]   - Right.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.720]   - I'm saying there are ways you deploy your weapons
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   if you are aggressively trying to make this a revenue,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.240]   bearing sort of thing.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.720]   And then they're the ways that you deploy your weapons
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.600]   when you just want to make sure that you can protect
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.000]   your own company against incursions from other patents.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.280]   So far, it looks like they're mostly saying,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.120]   you can't make stuff that we think customers will think
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.000]   are knock off of our technology.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.040]   Also, you can't try to come after us
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.240]   but your patents in a way to try to get us to buy you off
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.640]   because we're gonna try to make sure we slap you down
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.680]   pretty quickly there.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.120]   I'm not gonna pretend I understand all this.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.360]   This is just what other,
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.880]   again, sometimes I have seeing eye nerds
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.520]   that explain things that are above my prey grade.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.640]   That's what I've been telling me.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.480]   - Well, and purportedly, Apple.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.960]   Reportedly, Apple has done this before
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   where they're not really trying to make money
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.880]   on the royalties, but they are trying to slow
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.000]   the rest of the industry down.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.040]   They get ahead by innovating, firewire,
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.760]   the scuttlebutt about firewire was that Apple
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.960]   which started charging for firewire
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.440]   after the camera companies had already adopted it
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.120]   and all the PC manufacturers didn't adopt firewire
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.280]   because they didn't wanna pay that $2 per unit royalty,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.880]   which would have ended up be a $50 increase on PCs
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.280]   by the time it reached the reseller.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.640]   And what that did is it wasn't good for firewire
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.760]   in the long term, but in the short term,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.040]   Apple took over the video market
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   because suddenly that was the easy way
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.280]   to plug your camera into your computer
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.760]   and USB didn't really work.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   Never, it never has for that type,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.520]   for live streaming or live input.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440]   - Adam, did you wanna?
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.320]   - Yeah, 'cause this has changed a little bit
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.560]   from a while back when what you see is to see more
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   with the large companies was that they'd end up doing,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.040]   they'd kind of get up together in a room
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.160]   and almost play a game of war with their patent portfolios.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.360]   It's like, oh, I've got this one
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.880]   and that beats this other one.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.520]   And they just keep piling them on
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.920]   and then kind of at the end, add up,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.360]   who was in charge and come up with some sort of settlement.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.560]   I mean, that's what we saw.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.840]   I don't know if you remember way back when
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   when Microsoft paid Apple $150 million
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.760]   and it was this broad patent sharing because of it.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.240]   That was sort of the end of the game of war
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.320]   was that Microsoft was down $150 million
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.960]   and so they ended up and everyone was happy.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.080]   - But what's the end in here, HTC
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.720]   and Samsung's stop making phones?
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.960]   - Yeah, we'll see that.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.800]   I don't think they can--
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.880]   - Smart phone not look like this.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.600]   I mean, what does it look like?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.960]   What, it's gonna be portrait mode.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.160]   It's gonna have a touch screen that's black.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160]   - In the Samsung action,
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.960]   in the Samsung action, they're more concerned about things
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   like the dockish icons that they had with the Galaxy Tab.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.200]   They're more concerned about, look, you've got a,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.000]   a something that from the front looks exactly
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   like a first generation iPad.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.040]   You turn onto its side and suddenly looks like a wedding cake
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.720]   but from the front on, screenshots can make it look that way.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.640]   If you go into the Samsung's website,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.200]   once again, they've sort of adopted,
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.680]   it is a honeycomb tablet, but they've sort of adopted
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.280]   that sort of strip of docked icons at the bottom
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.800]   that people tend to associate with an iPad.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.640]   So that's largely what they're going after, I think.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.000]   - So that's an easy thing to fix though, isn't it?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.840]   I mean, that's all you have to do to fix that
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.400]   is redesign your icons.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.800]   - They could hire Kai Kraus.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.120]   - Yeah.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   - How hard is that?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   - They don't go.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.400]   I don't get the feeling that Apple would be satisfied
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.720]   with a change in the icons.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.680]   - Well, I think that for Apple,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.840]   I mean, all of these lawsuits slow everybody down.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.520]   I think that's, that doesn't, they don't have to win.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.440]   They just have to keep everybody in uncertainty.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.720]   They have to have people not,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.960]   they have to have consumers not sure
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.400]   whether this is gonna be a viable platform
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.240]   they're getting onto.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.080]   - Hasn't worked by the way,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   Android is now 50% of the market world,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.640]   smartphone market worldwide.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.840]   So it hasn't completely worked.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.080]   Maybe it will work.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.600]   - Or when you look at the profits that Apple's making
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.120]   on the, on there, they're now two thirds of the.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.320]   - Yeah, profits are fine,
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.680]   but I don't know if they're slowing down
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.680]   Android sales, particularly.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.880]   - Well, and also I gather there's,
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.520]   the Android sales are really high,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.600]   but there's also a huge returns.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.440]   - Is that true?
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.200]   - So yeah, people, I forget, that was a couple weeks ago.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.640]   I read something about how, you know,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.840]   some, you know, 20% to 30% of Android phones
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.000]   were actually being returned.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.040]   As opposed to like 1.7% of Apple smartphones.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   - Well, that's interesting.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.600]   So that activation, the half million activations,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.200]   a day that Google touts,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.600]   well you got to subtract, you know,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.920]   100,000 for return.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.760]   - Yeah, it was kind of a big deal,
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.120]   because I mean, it is, you get the phone,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.520]   you get home, you're not happy with it.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.400]   - I think a lot of people find it too complicated,
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.240]   I agree with you.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.080]   - Yeah.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.920]   - So I actually, I want to add,
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.360]   I'm just looking at this,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   this Android return numbers comes from TechCrunch.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.600]   And they're quoting,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.440]   it's an article in TechCrunch from John Biggs
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.160]   who's quoting a person familiar with handset sales.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.120]   (laughing)
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.280]   So, I'm not sure I buy this in three.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.840]   And then, you know, I can't,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.440]   was a business insider wrote,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.960]   well, you know, I find that number difficult to believe
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.760]   because actually it's a consumer electronics executive
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.000]   writing for the Pudong Daily,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.080]   saying I don't know what that is.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.280]   I'll tell you, I love this business
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.960]   because these sources are so different, you know.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.440]   - The Pudong Daily, I mean, I go there every morning.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.680]   - Well, it's obviously a Chinese,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.560]   probably a Taiwanese newspaper,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.960]   but he says, "For my experience,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.720]   retailers will complain and ask for compensations
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.040]   if the return rate's higher than five or 7%.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.600]   Who would sell a phone if it had 40% return rate
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.040]   that you just wouldn't,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   you just wouldn't want to be in that business?"
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.440]   And, you know, it's a pain for everybody.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.600]   So we don't know what the Android return rates are.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.400]   I would guess though that they're higher than 1.7%,
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.880]   which is the Apple return rate.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.720]   I'm sure they are.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.560]   - Yeah.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.920]   - Because I know people who bought Android phones
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.680]   on my recommendation who said,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.400]   "I can't figure it out, it's too complicated."
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.240]   And the thing is the iPhone is the gold standard.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   - It's a geeky, I mean, it's a geeky phone.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.920]   I think that I'm-- - That's why I like it.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.720]   - I'm waiting for the Galaxy 2S to come out
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.160]   'cause I'm gonna get-- - Well, you know who has one.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.000]   - I know. - So as I lean in,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.240]   it's a beautiful phone.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.800]   I'm waiting for the iPhone 4S to come out
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.040]   or whatever they call this one.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.720]   Now, maybe not in September.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.520]   Now, the Wall Street Journal is saying,
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.040]   "Oh no, our sources say October."
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.880]   - Yeah, but they're talking to Pudang Daily 2s.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.360]   (laughing)
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.520]   - I think it's pretty clear that iOS 5 and iPhone 5
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.240]   were the next iPhone, we should just call it that.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.000]   We'll come out at the same time.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.560]   Probably sometime between September 15th and the end of the year.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.320]   - You gotta do it before Christmas sales, right?
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.840]   I would think they'd hope for back to school sales,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.000]   but I guess not.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.240]   - So-- - But remember that they did promise
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   iOS 5 in September, they didn't say fall.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.040]   - Okay, so-- - No.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.160]   - You wouldn't think they'd come out with a--
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.720]   Maybe they'd announce the phone in September,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.120]   but it'd available October 5th or something like that.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.440]   - John Pachowski, actually it's all things dean
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.560]   at the Wall Street Journal, John Pachowski says,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.320]   "It's going to be an October surprise.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.440]   Sources with knowledge--"
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.240]   I'm so sick of these.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.760]   "Sources with knowledge of the situation
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.960]   say that those other sources who claim Apple's
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.440]   blacked out employee vacations in the last
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.240]   two weeks of September are misinformed."
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.640]   So it's a fight between the unnamed sources now.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   - Where's the Pudong Daily to weigh in?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.000]   - We need the Pudong Daily.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.760]   - Yeah, we have a true-- - Yeah, we have a true pet.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.880]   - I think one way or the other,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.520]   we're gonna get an A5 based iPhone,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   maybe a curvy little swoop.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.240]   It looked like the Samsung, you know,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.640]   I think is why Apple's all upset about the Samsung phone.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.480]   - 'Cause it's closer to--
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.120]   - 'Cause they're next iPhone.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.520]   And this is why Samsung, remember, demanded
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.000]   a look at the next iPhone.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.760]   I think Apple, in this case, is copying the slightly
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.080]   curved screen of the Galaxy S.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.040]   So who knows?
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.960]   But who stole from whom we don't know?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.840]   I'm so glad.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   I think we're done.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.040]   Are we done with unnamed sources in court dates?
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.680]   Yes.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.760]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.320]   - No. - For now.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.480]   - Oh, geez.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.880]   - And be a back-o-sir for the Chicago S.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.040]   - Just don't hit the impressionappleinsider.com.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.280]   - I know. - We can move on.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.320]   - And there's another lawsuit.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.560]   And another, and another.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.080]   - By the way. - It's a great big target.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.440]   - As long as we're talking,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   quoting all things D and Apple, iPhone sales,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.120]   Apple did oust Nokia as the world's largest smartphone vendor.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.000]   Here's the graph, which I misread last Sunday on Twitch.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.720]   Apple is the blue, 18.5%.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Nokia is 15.2%, but lo and behold, look who is number two.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.160]   It's not Nokia, it's Samsung.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.680]   I had no idea they were that big.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.920]   They are the number two smartphone vendor worldwide.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.120]   That's why Android's doing so well,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.760]   'cause of course all of their handsets are Android.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.920]   And that's why Eileen is so happy 'cause she has Samsung.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.880]   And then 48% are other.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.120]   - That's an awful lot of other.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.080]   - Yeah, not Nokia, not Samsung, not Apple.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   HTC, LG, Motorola, all have to be in there.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.240]   By the way, all Android.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.280]   It's one thing you know about Apple
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.440]   is there's no other source of Apple iPhones.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.600]   Unless you go to China.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.960]   - They have more stores.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.680]   - All right, we're gonna take a break.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.320]   Thank you, Andy, for joining us today.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.400]   Andy is the guy in charge of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.440]   And you didn't go to, you didn't go to,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.520]   you had the whole place.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.120]   - That's the call me, I'll make sure the kid hits the front
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.160]   stores up and not the bottle.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.020]   - He is the man in charge of deliveries at the
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.120]   Chicago Sun Times.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.560]   He runs the Paper Boy Core.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.680]   Do they still have Paper Boys?
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.960]   I guess they do.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   - Mostly they're Paper Men who can throw things
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.840]   out of the passenger sides of their windows.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   - It seems in this area it's people driving very old cars,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.000]   burning oil, 'cause I know 'cause I hear it in the morning.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Also with this Adam Anxt,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.840]   tidbitstidbits.com, you can read online
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.280]   or get it in your mailbox every week, which I do.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.960]   - But no papers, I'm sorry.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.440]   - No papers. - We don't throw anything.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.560]   - You do not have Paper Boys.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   - We do not have Paper Boys.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.240]   - Or Ben, or women.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.000]   - No, it's just all electronic.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.920]   You gotta go electronic these days.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.800]   - You know what we should do?
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.760]   We should do sometime, maybe not this time,
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.800]   but next time we'll do this whole thing via go to meeting.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   Have you seen the new HD faces?
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.040]   Did I show it to you?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.320]   - I haven't seen it.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   - I haven't seen it.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.280]   - Well, I saw the copy and I was gonna try
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.520]   to get it all working out, but it is awesome.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.120]   This is one of the big reasons we were doing
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.600]   some of our classes without go to meeting.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.440]   - 'Cause no video.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.480]   - 'Cause we do tons and tons of classes
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.360]   and tons and tons of meetings in go to meeting.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.880]   But we were like, the rest handful of them like,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   "Oh, we really wanna see a person."
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.960]   And so we would go back to faces when I saw this.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.800]   I was like, "Ah, this is--"
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.960]   - Well, imagine, and you could try this free,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.000]   I'm gonna tell you how it was just a second,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.120]   but imagine like a Google Hangout with six people,
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.640]   except that everybody's high def looking really good.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.720]   It really transforms online meetings.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.080]   It's, you know, we were talking about
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.480]   how much a Cisco video conferencing system
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.800]   could cost, tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.280]   Go to meeting $49 a month, as many meetings you want,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.920]   as long as you want, and now with video,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.320]   their new HD faces.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.280]   It just increases the effectiveness
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.120]   of your online meetings.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.280]   You can see facial expressions.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.600]   You could put the faces, I like 'em up at the top
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.000]   'cause I wanted to buy the camera
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.960]   so that when I looked at them,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.080]   it looked like I was looking into the camera,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.160]   but you put it on the side.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.040]   And of course, the rest of the screen is occupied
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.760]   by the presenter's screen.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.320]   That's what go to meetings always done so well,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.520]   using that Citrix remote access back end.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.720]   So you have screen sharing,
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.760]   any of the presenters can share their screens.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.920]   You've got video now, you've got both teleconferencing
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   and VoIP.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   Of course, if you're using the video,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.120]   you're gonna use the VoIP, which makes it so simple,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.800]   and so simple to set up a meeting.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.160]   I think we have more online meetings because of it.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.680]   I mean, it's just an email,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.480]   everybody, you know, invitation, everybody clicks accept.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.320]   You've got it when, you know, the alarm goes off,
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.960]   you've got the phone number, if you need it,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.000]   you've got the website, you just click that link,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.240]   and boom, you're doing it.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.280]   Now everybody's got cameras, so all you need is a webcam.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   And of course, internet access,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.440]   and you're gonna have video in your meetings.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.360]   It's incredible.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.200]   For sales presentations, for training sessions,
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.800]   weekly status meetings, all right from your desk,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.840]   try it free for 30 days is very simple.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.280]   Visit gotomeeting.com, click the try it free button,
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.600]   and use the promo code MAC break,

[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.880]   the offer code is MAC break.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.040]   I think it's six people at a time.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.840]   We should, we'll do one.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.240]   You know what, next for next show, we'll do one.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   I'll just show you what it looks like.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.440]   It is beautiful.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.840]   They've really licked this whole video conferencing thing.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   I think they've turned it on and it's head.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.240]   Go to meeting.com, try it free button,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.960]   use the offer code MAC break.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.720]   We thank Citrix for their long, ongoing support
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.560]   of this.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.800]   I think they're one of our top advertisers on this show.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.480]   So not only is Apple now the world's largest smartphone vendor,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.040]   they also have two thirds of,
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.360]   you were just alluding to this,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.040]   of the mobile phone profit.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.520]   So this has actually been true since 2008.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   This graph is a little cluttered.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.240]   - Well, but it's a crazy thing to look at.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.320]   If you look at the blue areas in that graph,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.160]   there's like, well Apple didn't exist back.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.420]   You know, you see this blue just
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.920]   growing in 2007.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.760]   It goes,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.840]   - What about, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.940]   - But here it's nothing, right?
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.940]   - Right.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.240]   - Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing big.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.340]   This is after the launch of the iPhone one,
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.040]   and then bigger than bigger than bigger than bigger
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.780]   than bigger than bigger.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.900]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.740]   Where's the key?
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.300]   Who else is on this?
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   - You've got ATC and--
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.820]   - RIM and Samsung.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.660]   - I know, Kia.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.980]   - Get this, Nokia Motorola, Sony, Ericsson, and LG
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.020]   all lost money selling phones in the most recent quarter.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.820]   - But they made up for it in volume.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.420]   - That's, those are the guys down.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.260]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.140]   Those are the guys down below the line.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.360]   These are the companies that lost money.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.380]   Wow.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.500]   And of course that's because of Apple
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.980]   taking it out of their pocket space.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.820]   Reaching in there,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.900]   say, give me this money.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.380]   Ah, I got your money.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.740]   - Well, and I think that part of it is,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.420]   is a certain, if you don't sell enough of them,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.820]   then the startup cost doesn't necessarily pay for
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.220]   the factories and the fabrication processes.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.740]   - Right, it's expensive to make them, right?
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.340]   - Yeah, and as well as one of the things
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.940]   that Apple's been very good at when we talk about
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.540]   those cash reserves is being able to buy so much
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.100]   in bulk that they're actually able to reduce their costs.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.460]   So for everyone, someone else to get the same feature set,
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.260]   they have to spend more money and have a much,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.180]   much smaller margin.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.460]   - I saw an article on that saying, was it,
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.300]   I fix it?
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.140]   I think it was, I fix it.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.420]   Who said, you know, if you compare the Samsung Galaxy tab
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.780]   and the iPad 2, you know, superficially they look very similar,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.460]   but you can tell when you're taking them apart
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.940]   that Apple just controls the chain and makes this beautiful
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.860]   thing and the Samsung Galaxy tab is just kind of like,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.620]   yeah, you know, well, it's kind of thrown together, I guess,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.460]   is what they're saying.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.780]   - Well, when you don't have that headroom
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.780]   and when you don't have the ability
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.620]   - You can't compete?
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.460]   - In that level of control, yeah.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.660]   - Yeah, you can't compete against it.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.380]   Big story this week kind of brought tears
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.380]   to a lot of people's eyes.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.180]   AT&T finally said, are you, any of you,
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.340]   I'm sure you all have grandfathered,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.420]   unlimited access, right?
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.260]   And he does.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.180]   - I actually don't, sir.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.220]   - You don't?
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.820]   You didn't like do everything you could to preserve that?
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.260]   - No, so the simple fact that matter is,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.940]   is that I'm not out and about that much.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.260]   So I'm a wifi pretty much all the time.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.100]   - Right, so you didn't care?
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.460]   - So I didn't care, save a few bucks a month
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.060]   and we're on the family plan trying to,
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.940]   I mean, basically the simple fact that matter is that,
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.540]   there's a lot of people this is true of,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.380]   is that I don't use the iPhone to make calls much.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.540]   I don't use the iPhone to use a huge amount of data
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.380]   when I'm out.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.260]   I do want it using data whenever I'm out, just about.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.820]   But, you know, 200 megabytes, not a problem.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.300]   You know, I do not go out to your lunch
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.940]   and watch a movie or something.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.020]   - You're saying you can get a buy with 200 megabytes
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.420]   a month at him?
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.740]   - Oh, trivially easily.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.820]   - Really?
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.220]   I think I do that in the day.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.180]   - Yeah, I don't even know.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.220]   I think my email, fetching my email does that.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.780]   - See this thing is I'm not doing this stuff when I'm out.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.620]   - Right.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.820]   - When I'm out, I'm doing other things.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.660]   - You work at home.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.860]   - When I'm using the bandwidth, right?
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.700]   I'm on wifi.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.780]   And there's a lot of wifi around too.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.820]   So, you know, like if I'm at Cornell,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.740]   I'm on the Cornell wifi network.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.380]   So, it's just, it's been one of those things where only,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.900]   I can only come close to the 200 megabytes when I'm traveling
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.820]   and using stuff pretty heavily.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.100]   - Well, that's actually kind of what AT&T is saying.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.380]   And I'm torn on this because it's really true
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.660]   that we're all demanding more and more bandwidth online.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.260]   I mean, I mean, you know, out there in the real world.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   - Yes.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.300]   - And I can just imagine how hard it is for these companies.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   I read a very interesting article that said,
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.180]   really the problem goes back to AT&T,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.260]   not buying enough of that 700 megahertz spectrum.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.620]   When the spectrum auction happened.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.980]   Remember, we went to digital TV and the UHF spectrums
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.940]   that the television, digital analog intelligence
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.940]   and stations were using, got sold by the FCC.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.380]   What was that, three or four years ago?
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.660]   And Verizon and AT&T got the lion's share,
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.100]   but Verizon bought twice as much as AT&T.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.100]   And now they're saying this is coming back
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.860]   to bite AT&T in the butt because they are gonna be in a band
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.940]   with constrained situation.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.100]   Whereas Verizon with twice as much of that 700 megahertz
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.100]   prime spectrum can implement their LTE, can be faster.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.340]   And in fact, this is what you're seeing now.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.540]   AT&T has said, yes, we have unlimited plans,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.540]   but if you are in the top 5% of our users.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.020]   - And they won't tell you what that means.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:02.860]   - Well, that's the problem.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.940]   - Now, extraordinary.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.020]   - Yeah, I mean, that could be three gigabytes
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.780]   for all we know, we don't know what that is.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.260]   You'll know when they clamp you down.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.580]   - October 1st, they're gonna start slowing you down.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.420]   - Well, but here's the question, will you actually know?
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.180]   Because 3G bandwidth is one of those things
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.180]   it's a little hard to know how much you're getting at.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.460]   - You may not, you may just say, boy, this sucks.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.100]   In fact, it may, all it may happen is,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.260]   boy, I hate AT&T even more now.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.100]   - Right.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.380]   Well, for me, it makes it a lot.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.300]   - Oh, God, Randy.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.020]   - It's, if you read the terms that they're proposing,
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.580]   it's not so much that they're gonna punish you
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.780]   for using more than two gigs.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.540]   It's more like, if it's true,
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.580]   if it really looks as though you're one of those people
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.580]   who, even if there's Wi-Fi available,
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.220]   your stream and Netflix 24 hours a day,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.380]   just to stick it to the man.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.580]   At some point, they're gonna start throttling you down
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.740]   after a warning, and even if they do throttle you down,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.380]   it's not that that's gonna be a month to month thing.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.740]   You start all over again in the next billing cycle.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.100]   So, how are those?
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.460]   - Interestingly, only throttling the people with unlimited.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.300]   - Yes.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.380]   - It really is, it really is, I think,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:12.020]   and I, a way to make sure the people aren't simply abusing,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.260]   they're abusing the 3G network
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.660]   when they could be using Wi-Fi,
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.140]   because you look at some of the numbers
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.940]   on how much usage of even cable bandwidth
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.660]   is being given over to streaming services like Netflix,
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.660]   and this is something that's really, really, really worrisome.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.420]   You add on the Hulu app, you add on the HBO Go app,
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.820]   more and more mobile devices on multi,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.580]   multi-platform mobile devices are designed to do nothing,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.020]   but stream video, stream video, stream video,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.060]   and if they don't put some sort of a plan into place
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.980]   to at least say that there are circumstances under which
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.860]   we may not want to have you transact 40 gigabytes
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.860]   worth of data in one month,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.500]   then that's kind of a natural evolution of the service.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.420]   - In their email, AT&T says this is for users
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.860]   who use an extraordinary amount of data,
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.020]   they still don't see what that is
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.460]   in a single billing period,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.380]   they say you can send and receive thousands of emails,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.500]   search thousands of web pages and watch hours.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.500]   That could be two, three, four hours of video every month,
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.820]   and not be in the top of our day.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.340]   Well, I'll tell you why I care about this.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.420]   If you watched, how much, actually,
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   I'm gonna ask the chat room, if you watched Twit Live,
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.660]   let's say you watched the good quality megabit stream,
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.500]   how long before you would go through
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.660]   what five gigabytes?
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.260]   Pretty quick, like a week, if you watched it all day.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.540]   And we certainly want people to watch,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.420]   but I think if you're on a 3G network,
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.540]   it would be prudent to watch the 400 kilobits stream.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.100]   It'd be prudent maybe to listen to audio
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.420]   instead of watching video.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.540]   - Yeah, I remember a little while ago,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.780]   when I was watching, when I had my 3G MyFi base station,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.940]   watching Netflix on Amtrak,
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.700]   I was transacting about 150 megabytes per hour.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.380]   So it's not as though I could even burn through
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.220]   an entire two gig stream if I were using it just for,
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.340]   here's two or three hours, which I'm gonna be free
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.620]   from all Wi-Fi, but I wanna be entertained.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.900]   So I don't think it's an unreasonable cap,
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.060]   especially if as AT&T is hinting,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.580]   it's not gonna be as simple.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.900]   You've used two gigabytes plus one kilobyte congratulations
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.620]   when you're now on to V.32 BIS data speed.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.060]   - In some ways, wouldn't it be easier though
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.420]   to be able to have it, to give us a number,
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.620]   saying that it's gonna be 3G, 4G.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.460]   - Well, then we could know how--
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.020]   - Then you could say they're a manager.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.100]   And then you know when you're gonna run into that,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.660]   and you can manage your experience.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.620]   - I think it's odd that they don't say the number.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.460]   - How about those numbers?
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.700]   - We'll start the hard cap that,
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.260]   would you like there to be a hard cap
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.060]   that doesn't change month to month?
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.940]   Or would you rather there be some flexibility
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.940]   for AT&T to say he really,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.500]   he really, really put the hammer to the band with this month,
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   but it turns out for the past three months,
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.980]   he's been actually under the two gig cap.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.460]   We're not gonna cut him off after five.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.540]   - I think it's marketing.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.580]   It's marketing, it's they don't wanna stop saying unlimited.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.260]   And in fact, they say if speed is more important,
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.100]   you may wish to switch to a tiered usage plan,
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.420]   where customers can pay for more data if they need it,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.340]   and will not see reduced speeds.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.220]   - I may wish to switch to Verizon.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.740]   - This is AT&T's, I think this is their buyer's remorse.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.540]   I think this is the regret that they have,
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.900]   in allowing unlimited to continue.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.820]   - Well, Verizon doesn't have unlimited anymore either.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.660]   - Nobody does.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.540]   - Yeah, but you can actually use the data.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.180]   I mean, if they're gonna slow me down,
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.860]   I mean, it's already slow, it's already a mess.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.220]   If AT&T was giving me great service and fast service,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.020]   and they wanted to charge me more for that,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.980]   okay, we can have that discussion.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.500]   But if I'm in San Francisco or New York,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.300]   or Los Angeles or Las Vegas,
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.020]   I'm not sure if my phone is going to work,
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.100]   voice or otherwise.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.500]   And so given that,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.700]   and the unlimited was the only thing
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.500]   that AT&T had its advantage for me.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.860]   - Except that this is AT&T's responding to that,
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.980]   if you think about it that way,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   by saying, oh, we can't keep Alex online,
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.740]   so we're gonna kind of hit these bandwidth hogs
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.140]   so we can give everybody else better services.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.540]   It's for you, Alex.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.100]   They're doing it for you.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.980]   - All I'm saying is now it's easy.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.260]   I'm looking forward to the new iPhone.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.860]   I'm not saying that I'm leaving AT&T.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.700]   - Oh, you won't.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.540]   You won't go to Verizon.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.380]   - I'm not sure.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.220]   I'm waiting for the new iPhone,
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.740]   and I'm gonna make a decision then
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.700]   as to, my problem is I have a family plan,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.020]   so I've got different iPhones starting at different times,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.860]   and I'll look at all this process.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.780]   But I am definitely, it's much easier for me
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.620]   to have this kind of even discussion.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.380]   I didn't even consider going to Verizon before,
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.220]   because I was like, I'm not gonna give up my unlimited plan.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.180]   - No, it's really unfortunate.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.660]   I don't know what your experience boss in Boston is, Andy,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.820]   or your experience, Adam, in wherever the hell you live.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.340]   But where are you, Philadelphia?
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.780]   Can I never remember?
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.620]   - Ithaca, New York.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.460]   - Ithaca.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.500]   It's the only city in America with lists.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.340]   - No, no, no.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.500]   - I actually moved here from Isequah, Washington.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.980]   - See, that's not a list.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   - Essentially isolated, as the bumper stickers say.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.820]   - That's bizarre.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.740]   You moved from Isequah to Ithaca?
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.580]   - Yes.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.820]   - That must have really confused your folks
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.580]   when you called and said, "Mom, we're moving to Ithaca.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.660]   Are you living Ithaca?"
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.220]   No, we're moving from Ithaca to Ithaca.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.420]   - We grew up in Ithaca, so it was very interesting.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.260]   - Oh, okay.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.100]   Mom, I understood.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.060]   (both laugh)
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.500]   In any event, I'd be very curious,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.180]   'cause I think, unfortunately, AT&T really gets a bad rap
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.740]   because most of the tech presses in San Francisco
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.460]   where truly does suck,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.900]   but that's not necessarily AT&T.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.340]   - You're having yourself shaking your phone.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.380]   - It's very hard to get new cell sites in San Francisco.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.500]   You know, it's a...
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.540]   - That's why it's difficult.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.900]   The experiences are so subjective.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.340]   And Boston AT&T almost always gives me a really good signal.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.980]   The only time I was able ever to discern a real difference
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.140]   in performance between accessibility between Verizon and AT&T
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.940]   was when my car broke down in the middle of I-95.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.660]   And we're talking about New England,
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.900]   where they just put rows right in the middle
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.300]   of bombed out mountains.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.460]   So the fact that I could get two bars on Verizon
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.620]   and zero on AT&T, well, okay, that's nice trivia.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.820]   But if you go to New York,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.260]   I've been to New York several times with Verizon phones
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.820]   and AT&T phones in my pocket.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.020]   Neither one of them could give me any data,
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.740]   even if they're showing me three or four bars
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.700]   of voice signal.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.460]   So it really depends on where you are,
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.900]   where you work, where you live.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.700]   And I don't really care that someone's getting
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.900]   a great signal in wherever they live,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.460]   as long as I can't get what I want for my live.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.380]   - Of course, I guess San Francisco is the town
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.020]   where you can't circumcise your child,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.100]   you can't buy a goldfish, you can't buy a hamster,
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.900]   but you can marry anything.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.740]   (laughing)
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.580]   And that's why we love it.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.420]   - Including your iPhone.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.820]   - And you can smoke marijuana in the corner.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.900]   Yeah, that's why we love it.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.380]   So the battle rage is now,
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.820]   and this is related over video over 3G.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.260]   FaceTime only works with Wi-Fi.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.380]   Both, I mean, I think Apple would like it to work with 3G.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.180]   But the question is, who's keeping it from doing so?
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.900]   And I would submit it by AT&T and Verizon, right?
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.980]   That's safe. - Right.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.820]   - Oh no.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.020]   And in fact, we also saw Skype briefly come out,
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.940]   like for one hour on the iPad.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.260]   He worked with 3G, and then now it's gone.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.580]   They said, oh, that was an error.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   But you have to think somebody called from Cupertino, right?
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.140]   - Or that someone called from Verizon?
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.940]   - Not Cupertino, from Verizon, yeah.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.460]   - If you ever wanna work on our network again,
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.460]   - Right, yeah.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.300]   - You will pull off.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.860]   - Otherwise you will see severe packet shaping.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.060]   - If Apple didn't want it, they would have just blocked it.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.900]   The fact Apple wants this, right?
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.660]   Apple wants 3G video.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.460]   So according to, this is a story in 9-5 Mac.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.380]   In June, we reported that the fifth generation iPhone
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.940]   had reached its final testing stage.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.140]   Within the report, we noticed that Apple and Verizon Wireless
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.660]   had yet to strike a deal for FaceTime video over 3G.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.180]   Now 9-5 sources have followed up to let us know
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.060]   progress on this situation.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.460]   Currently Verizon has many engineers testing
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   3G FaceTime in many regions with heavy iPhone usage.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.900]   They're saying the quality looks fairly good.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.860]   I think that's one of the things that's holding up FaceTime.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.100]   Adoption is the lack of 3G.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.740]   I think more people would use it if they could use it everywhere.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.580]   - Right?
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.340]   - Actually, if I can make an aside, Skype for iPad is back up.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340]   - It's back.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.180]   - Yeah.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.740]   - So maybe it was just a bad version.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.380]   - You're downloading right now.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.220]   (laughing)
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   - Exactly, let's get it on here.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.300]   - It's a good sound.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.140]   - Try it now.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.660]   - Just put it right into the mix.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.140]   - Yeah, we can put, we'll call somebody,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.420]   we'll hold it up and put it,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   actually we have the, we have the dongle.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.060]   We can make it happen.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.420]   - Well, it's a question with FaceTime though.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.700]   Is it really the 3G that's an issue?
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.140]   My suspicion is that it's not so much that people,
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.020]   oh, they want to do it over 3G,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.100]   but that there's the big unknown
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.020]   if someone's going to be available.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.660]   Or you have to know that their wife--
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.380]   - And have their pants on.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.780]   (laughing)
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.220]   - Well, you know, that's the beauty of the iPhone.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.900]   You can just sort of point it right.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   - Just hold it up or down, depending on your goals.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.100]   - It's the wiener approach, I'm sorry.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.740]   (laughing)
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.220]   - He's talking about the house of rep,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.300]   former disgraced house of representatives member.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.020]   - Skype, it's the next way to give me disgraced.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.340]   - So are you downloading?
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.940]   - I'm downloading, it's almost time.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.340]   - So it's back, so I guess I shall take it out.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.740]   I shall take it back.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.940]   Do we know why they pulled it?
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.380]   - It might have just been a bad, something bad.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.460]   - That's happened before.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.820]   - Skype said that it had been released prematurely.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.180]   - Right.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.660]   - Which happens to all of us sometimes, you know?
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.180]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.380]   - It does work with 3G, it does with Wi-Fi.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.900]   - Well, and I do think, I mean, one of the rumors
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.140]   about the next iPhone is that it is going to pretty much
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.980]   work on every network.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.100]   I think Apple's idea of only working with one manufacturer
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.900]   leaves them in the situation where they don't have
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.980]   a lot of leverage.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.540]   But being able to have Sprint say for instance,
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.420]   "Hey, you can use it whenever you want, it's all fine."
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.620]   - Hello and welcome to Skype for iPad.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.020]   - Hello, it's the Skype Lady, I love her!
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.940]   I'd like to let the Skype Lady know that I'm in London.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.780]   - You have an iPad too.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.660]   - Every app that must be run, there isn't a little bit of fun.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.460]   - Hi there. - Hi there.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.700]   - You now get to experience Skype video calling
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.100]   on the Skype. - It's located in Liverpool.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.340]   What the hell is the deal?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.540]   - We built this version of Skype. - I thought they were Dutch.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.900]   - I thought they were Dutch. - It's for the iPad.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.980]   - As well as being able to chat face to face.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.540]   If you've got an iPad too, you can switch to the camera
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.220]   on the back to show what's going on around you.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.500]   - Let's do that. - Like my new trainers.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.340]   - Those are called sneakers here in the US.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.260]   - You can also now instant message.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.060]   - bottle of Loosery doesn't have a MacBook Air,
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.820]   he's got an old 2010 model.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.780]   - And all of your contacts are available at the touch.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.940]   - Hey, we have to get our name right there.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.300]   - Right, I'm off now. - Bye.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.420]   - Let's call her. - Bye.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.060]   - Let's call her. We know who the Skype Lady is now.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.700]   - I'd like to Skype calls to your friends on their laptops,
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.380]   mobile phones, or any other Skype friendly device.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.500]   - I think the iPad is kind of a,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.460]   now that it has a camera on it, it's kind of a nad.
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.740]   - Your operator may charge you extra
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.380]   for using your data connection.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.500]   Think about switching to a Wi-Fi network.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.420]   - It's a Skype for iPad.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.620]   Available now. - That's probably,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.060]   they probably put that in there because--
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.540]   - Maybe that's what they forgot to put on.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.420]   - Yeah, that is exactly it.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.860]   - That's exactly it.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.100]   We need to have the message.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.900]   - The disclaimer, rats.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.820]   I thought you were gonna handle that, Charlie.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.900]   I thought you were gonna handle that, Sally.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.740]   Anyway, it's in there now.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.300]   - They should have Jason Streepam.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.220]   - Yeah, they should.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.060]   They would be funny.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.140]   - If you need to talk to some real things, just go.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.780]   That way the relatives won't find out what you're talking about
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.300]   'cause it's always cool. - Oh, I like him.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   He's great.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.140]   I, according to the New Yorker,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.460]   they have sold a huge number of subscriptions
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.300]   on the iPad, 20,000 people.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.620]   - Who are they charging?
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.700]   - It's $450.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.780]   20,000 people.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   But even more people, they made about $1.2 million.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.980]   They even more people, $6.59.99.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.540]   75,000 existing subscribers, like me,
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.260]   I subscribe to the print edition,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.420]   read it on our iPads.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.500]   I love it because I don't have to buy it separately anymore.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.260]   It used to be five bucks.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.540]   So overall then, Condi Nast says,
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.820]   we've got 100,000 readers on the iPad.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.980]   That's significant.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.780]   Now it's small compared to their 1,000,000,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.180]   it's 1/10 of their 1,000,000 print subscribers.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.940]   - Right, so you kind of wonder
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.660]   how much they spent developing their New Yorker app,
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.580]   which certainly wasn't 10 bucks for some high school kid.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.900]   - No, it's nicely done.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.220]   Although I imagine that Condi probably has a centralized
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.300]   app development team that can port this stuff,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.820]   'cause they've got the Vanity Fair, GQ, Wired,
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.140]   Lammer, Golf Digest, Self and Allure, all on the iPad.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.820]   So it would make sense.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.620]   Although the New Yorker, of all of those is the best-selling.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.420]   Of course, its readers are affluent, intelligent.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.260]   - And good looking.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.660]   - And good looking.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.500]   - Also, they've got content that works well
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.100]   within a new book or an iPad.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.540]   So it's long form.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.980]   It doesn't cost them a lot of money
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.300]   to get a long photo or video,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.580]   a long photo essay and reformat it
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.980]   that'll work under multiple formats.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.500]   - No, you're absolutely right.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.420]   It's just a natural, in fact.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.060]   It's almost like getting a little novel every week.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.580]   It's so long.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.420]   So in fact, the iPad's--
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.020]   - It is like getting a little novel every day.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.740]   - I know, I can be real here.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.300]   - It's a guilt-inducer for me.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.860]   I never, it's like getting this Sunday Times.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.620]   - I just look at it and go, "Eh."
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.780]   - I can't decide whether the New Yorker
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.380]   is worse than the economist for me that way.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.220]   - Yes, same thing.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.060]   - I just, you know, both of them,
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.260]   you're just like, "Oh, I have to read all that."
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.060]   - I think that's the secret to tablet sales
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.380]   is that a tablet version of the magazine
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.660]   is less guilt-inducing.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.620]   It's just more of a reference work
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.100]   than or something like a search or--
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.700]   - Yeah, and the piles. - And you always have it.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.700]   Yeah, you don't have big piles.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.300]   - I actually, I find it certain magazine structure.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.820]   So like Flipboard.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.540]   Flipboard, I think, is the best way to look at anything
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.620]   on the iPad right now.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.620]   But also-- - You can't actually subscribe
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.140]   to The New Yorker on the Flipboard.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.380]   You don't get the-- - Oh, really?
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.340]   - Well, you don't get the, not paid subscription.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.860]   You get the stuff they put on the web, but it's great.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.700]   - It's awesome.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.940]   - And, but I find it interesting with both Flipboard
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.060]   and with the daily, those two specifically,
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.220]   I don't feel like, I don't even know how to get to the history,
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.340]   like to old stuff.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.340]   So I always, it really becomes this thing,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.140]   like I'm just gonna dip in and grab on to whatever data
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.300]   I'm gonna read today, and then tomorrow
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   it'll be something different.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.060]   And I think that that takes some of that pressure off
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.900]   feeling like I have to finish it.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.740]   - Exactly. - 'Cause I know
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.260]   that when I get an economist, now I've learned it,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.660]   I buy an economist right before I got on flights
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.540]   and I read them on the way up and on the way down.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.380]   - And then you throw it out.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.420]   - No, I just leave it in the seat for somebody else.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.580]   I'm like, I'm not even taking it out,
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.220]   'cause I'll feel like I have to read it.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.660]   - No, this, I think that Ipad sales potentially
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.140]   are huge for magazines that are guilt inducing,
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.180]   like The Economist, I like The New Yorker,
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.940]   like The New York Times, like The Wall Street Journal.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.500]   I think those are, those are the magazines
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.260]   that are gonna benefit.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.500]   Vanity Fair, People magazine, you go, eh...
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.940]   - Wired's sort of the same for me.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.340]   - Same thing, Wired is-- - Guilt inducing, yeah.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.500]   - It's like, oh, it's sort of for work.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.860]   - I should read it. - I should read it.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.220]   - I should read it.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.300]   - It's much easier to read, though.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.500]   Wired is much easier to read now
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.820]   because they made it in so many small articles.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.300]   - I can actually-- (laughs)
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   - You know, like, it's not like,
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.340]   there's only like one or two really long articles
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.780]   instead of like most of the magazines.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.660]   You can just kind of skim a lot of it.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   - Yeah. - Much better.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.100]   - Can you, Adam, have you looked at maybe making an app
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.020]   for tidbits or is it just, does not make sense for you?
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.420]   - We actually have an app for tidbits.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.020]   It's a very simple app.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.900]   It is free and anyone can download it
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.860]   and it's on the iPad, it looks a lot like mail.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.900]   - What was your thinking there?
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.340]   Why did you do that?
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.700]   - Well, one of our staffers is a developer
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.500]   and he wanted to try it, so we did something simple.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.060]   It's, I mean, basically what it does
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.580]   is it sucks in our RSS feed.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.140]   And so we wanted to do it as a way,
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.980]   mostly honestly, for people who commute
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.380]   to be able to read tidbits offline.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.100]   Because it's easy enough to do online stuff
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.340]   in a variety of different ways.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.980]   And people get tidbits in emails,
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.260]   so you can always do it that way too.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.340]   But if you're on a train somewhere,
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.260]   you're just totally offline on your iPad, for instance,
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.900]   it's a better interface.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.380]   And so one of the rules we've also always said was
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.460]   if this is make it available in as many formats
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.100]   as in approaches as you can.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.300]   So that was another one.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.860]   - Yeah, that's my attitude too.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.420]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.340]   Don't make people choose.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.500]   - Do you have numbers?
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.620]   I guess you probably can't even track that.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.980]   - You know, you have some numbers,
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.540]   but it's not gotten a huge number of downloads
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.900]   or huge readership.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.100]   But it's also really simple.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.260]   We were looking at ways of being able to build it
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.900]   and so you'd be able to search the archive
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   and if you were online and bring other apps into it
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.740]   and whatnot.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.100]   But there's a certain level of how much effort
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.260]   do you want to put into a free app
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.820]   that's not going to make you any money?
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.220]   - And it's a universal iPad and iPhone.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.060]   - Yes.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.220]   - Yeah, nice.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.260]   I didn't even know that.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.460]   But you're right, because I get the email,
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.820]   so I know it's on my device,
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.220]   'cause my email's on my device,
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.220]   so it's easy for me to read that.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.980]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   You know what, would somebody get my iPad?
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.780]   It's on my desk.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.100]   Maybe we can make a little, you can call me
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.060]   and I'll call you.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.900]   - Yes.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.980]   - Be a little weird.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.820]   We could try it.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.580]   We just see how good it looks.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.500]   But first, I want to tell you about the painless way
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   to send invoices that I discovered in 2004,
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.580]   thanks to the lovely and talented Amber MacArthur.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.860]   I'm talking about fresh books, painless invoicing.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.620]   Focus on your work, not your paperwork,
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.020]   with freshbooks.com.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.420]   Nobody likes doing the invoices.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.660]   You know, I get to the end of the year
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.020]   and every time I get to the end of the year,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.780]   it'd be like, I mean, end of the month.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.100]   It'd be like, oh, I'm not gonna get paid
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.380]   unless I send out invoices.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.540]   And there's also this deferred gratification,
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.140]   'cause you send out the invoice,
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.380]   then the month later you get paid,
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.260]   maybe two months, sometimes three months later.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.660]   So it's almost like, well, I'm not even gonna bother.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.180]   But this got all changed for me
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.780]   when I started using fresh books.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.420]   First of all, you put your logo in
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.060]   and it's just, it's almost as automatic as can be
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.140]   to create an invoice.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.580]   If it's a recurring invoice,
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.700]   they'll actually do it for you automatically.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.500]   And here's a nice feature.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.300]   You see this little checkbox that says PayPal there?
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.300]   Your clients can pay with a push button in the email.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.340]   They can do a credit card, paypal, authorize.net,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.940]   11 different payment gateways.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.300]   So that means you get paid faster,
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.780]   'cause there's less friction to the client paying.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.500]   But when you set up the recurring bill,
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.940]   you can get your client to set up recurring payments.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.780]   And then nobody has to intervene.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.700]   This is happy for everybody.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.340]   You just do the work and get paid.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.460]   You can use any currency.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.300]   That was good for me, 'cause I was working in Canada.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.020]   You can send invoices by mail as well,
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.540]   if you want, for an additional fee they'll print stamp
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.380]   and mail it for you.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.540]   I did that with some of the more traditional clients,
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.620]   'cause I knew they wanted paper invoices.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.460]   If you use time and hours billing,
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.820]   they have an iPhone app or you can just do it on the web
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.860]   and it will automatically take those time and hours,
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.340]   (imitates popping)
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.380]   put them right into the invoice for you.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.900]   And of course, if they don't pay automatically,
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.460]   you can ding them every 30 days or whatever.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.540]   And so you get paid more often, it's easier to do,
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.460]   and get this.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:19.420]   It's free for the first three clients.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.900]   How about that?
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.660]   I'd say free for three.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.460]   If you decide you like it after you try the three,
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:31.260]   if you wanna do more clients, it's very affordable.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.180]   We're talking 20 bucks for 25 clients.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.340]   They have different plans of course,
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.420]   but free for the first three, so no reason not to try it out.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.780]   Go to freshbooks.com and sign up today.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.980]   And by the way, yes, I know you want the birthday cake.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.820]   They are still giving away a birthday cake
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.580]   to somebody listening right now.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.300]   Once a week, it doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.100]   You just let 'em know you heard about it on Macbreak.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.780]   And they're gonna have a drawing
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.500]   among their new customers from Macbreak
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.020]   and one of you will get a birthday cake from FreshBooks.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:08.300]   Freshbooks.com free for the first three, I love that.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.140]   All right, I got my--
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.780]   - So here's an interesting thing, Leo.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.620]   - Yes.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.540]   - You said that FreshBooks takes PayPal
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   and I was looking at our take control eBooks payment approaches
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.780]   a report recently and I was shocked,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.380]   just shocked to see that over 60%
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.780]   of the people who are buying eBooks are using PayPal.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.260]   - Yeah, it's funny because there's this,
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.340]   there is some push back against PayPal.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.780]   We only take donations from PayPal
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.220]   'cause this was easier for me to set up
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.580]   and I should set up all the other ones
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.140]   and I just never got around to it.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.100]   But it does seem like--
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.780]   - It just works for most people.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.860]   - As much as you hear bad things about PayPal, it does.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.340]   I've used it for a long time.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.220]   I pay a lot of shareware fees in PayPal, a lot of shareware.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.700]   It's just easy for them to set up.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.900]   But you have other systems or--
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.700]   - Yeah, it's the company we work with.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.540]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.660]   - Yeah, they take all the credit cards and everything.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.580]   And so it was interesting 'cause I had always,
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.700]   they added PayPal, I don't know, four, five years ago,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.300]   whatever. - 60%.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.260]   - I just, yeah, I didn't think it was that big a deal
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.700]   and then all of a sudden, whoa, I saw this trip.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.220]   But we saw this whole thing with people being charged
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.500]   multiple times for Lion.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.340]   - Really?
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   - And with PayPal, seemingly, the App Store had some problems.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.660]   But again, apparently a whole lot of people paying for Lion
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.700]   on the App Store with PayPal.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.220]   - Thank you for stalling a little bit for me
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.060]   'cause I'm long.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:29.900]   (laughing)
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.060]   You did that very well.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.180]   I'm logging into my Skype on the iPad.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.020]   Looks just like the regular Skype.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:37.860]   Do you have yours?
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.780]   - I have it, I don't have much battery left.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.020]   I was playing with it a lot before we started.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.460]   I have it on my phone too.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.100]   - Well, this, that won't charge you, will it?
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.780]   - Oh yeah, I know, I was looking for a way from now.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.100]   - Okay, so I need to turn off Wi-Fi first of all,
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.940]   or should I?
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.780]   Should we try it with Wi-Fi?
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.540]   No, let's try it without Wi-Fi.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.860]   Let's try it 'cause I'm hooked up to our very fast.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.700]   We have a lot of internet in here.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.340]   Let me turn that off.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.940]   Go to Verizon, by the way, Verizon 3G,
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.940]   turn it back on, just killed it.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.460]   And so what's, I don't know what's,
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.660]   whispering my ear.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.500]   - It's a,
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.660]   (laughing)
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.980]   - I'm not getting her a thing.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.820]   - Let me, ah!
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.660]   I can type it in.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.940]   - Oh yeah, you can type it in.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.940]   So let me, I love you.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.540]   - Type it into a piece of plastic.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.540]   - I mean, I'm,
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.620]   okay, so we're gonna add Alex,
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.940]   and we're gonna make a call.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.100]   This'll be the shortest Skype call in history.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.460]   - You're better, no, it's already dead.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.860]   - Two feet away from me.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.940]   - We can go iPhone to, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:32.780]   - iPhone be good.
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.860]   - So what's funny is, I have the same problem.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.820]   I had, I had actually visual mount,
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.700]   I installed Skype, and then it,
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.540]   - Okay.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.380]   - I didn't have any battery.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.060]   - I'm gonna do a video call with you.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:44.900]   Yes?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.060]   - Yes.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.500]   - All right.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.340]   Connecting.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.540]   - So I'll show you what this looks like.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.380]   - Ew.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.300]   - We don't have a close up.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.820]   Well, we do have a close up.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:53.660]   Do we?
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.540]   Oh my God.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.900]   We are so professional.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:01.060]   Connecting, I am connecting Alex Lindsey on my iPad.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.980]   I brought this to the jury room,
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.820]   I thought I'd be able to,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.180]   they said, they said very clearly,
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.460]   we have wifi.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.300]   Bring your notebook,
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.300]   and then they said put your notebook away.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.540]   (laughing)
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.580]   It's connecting, what are you doing?
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.500]   I'm looking.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.620]   Oh, wait a minute, I lost,
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.500]   I got a little dot, I lost my,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.260]   but this is a great experience.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.340]   I've lost my 3G.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:30.620]   Verizon, I guess, is not as good as we all thought.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.140]   - You know, I have five bars on my AT&T.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.900]   Just thought I'd let you know.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.660]   I don't have any,
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.060]   do we not have Verizon in here?
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.260]   Is it Verizon connectivity bad?
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.980]   Okay, I'm gonna ask our live studio audience,
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.700]   please turn off your my fis.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.860]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:49.060]   That was a joke.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.980]   I don't know, I can't,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.580]   - I got that joke, I thought it was very good.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.900]   - You left, oh now I'm recording something.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.980]   Skype recording, what does that mean?
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.940]   - Oh, you got the little circle?
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.020]   - I got the red thing that says,
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.380]   Skype is recording something.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.300]   - It's recording you.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.420]   I guess it's good for a rest of the recorder as well.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.460]   - What the hell?
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.700]   - That just means that it has controlled the camera.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.620]   - Oh, oh, thank you,
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.660]   I've never seen that before.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.540]   So I have to hang up before I can exit out.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.020]   Hey Dan, can I call you?
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.060]   Dan Hedrick's our check guy,
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.380]   are you available, should I call you?
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.700]   Do you have Skype running on your computer?
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:28.660]   I don't have enough 3G, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:32.340]   That was a real waste of time.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.540]   (Dan laughs)
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.900]   - Just a computer.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.900]   - Really sorry.
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.180]   Hey, speaking of waste of time,
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.140]   I guess I'll bring this up.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.780]   Apple has more money in the bank than the US government.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.380]   Not true anymore.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.420]   The US government got a loan, right?
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.260]   - They printed more.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.100]   - They're still signing on it, I think.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.340]   - Well, they haven't signed it yet.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.780]   So we're down to like, what, five bucks?
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.620]   - What?
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.940]   - We're probably down to pretty low now.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.300]   But Apple has $76 billion in cash.
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.460]   Actually, Bill Gates has more money
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.860]   than the US government.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.820]   (Dan laughs)
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.100]   - I wanna know if they're counting the $1 billion
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   the US government has a dollar coin stored in the mint.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.740]   - Well, this is what we were asking on Twitter.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.060]   Maybe you seem like one of those auto-didact types
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.060]   that might actually know.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.820]   - I think it's $11 billion worth of gold.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.660]   That's how much they haven't--
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.500]   - In Fort Knox.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.340]   - You even knew, Alex even knew the question before I asked it.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.380]   So they do have gold at Fort Knox.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.660]   - Yeah, I believe it's $11 billion worth of gold.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.180]   - Wow.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.820]   I have to admit that.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.540]   - I heard something incredible and wonderful
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.660]   that I hope the government got so desperate
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.860]   they would actually do this.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:35.340]   Turns out there's a loophole that says
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.260]   that they can't make up shortfalls
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.100]   by printing new paper money,
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.700]   but they can, on a side thing,
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.340]   they are allowed to do as many platinum coins as they want.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.180]   - Whoa.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.260]   - So essentially, if everything had fallen through,
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.780]   the US Treasury could have simply made, no joke,
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.100]   two or three platinum $1 trillion coins.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:55.940]   (Dan laughs)
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.420]   - And you would deposit them in their own bank
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.900]   and then use those $3 trillion coins
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.260]   as like, and draw upon like that deposit
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.100]   to like, from the government.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.620]   - Is this Andy, is this one of those things
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.820]   like, you know, like there's the president,
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.660]   then there's the vice president,
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   then a speaker of the house,
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.860]   and then you kind of work your way 75 levels down.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.980]   It's like the guy who's in charge of the mint can say,
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.740]   we're gonna print trillion dollar coins.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.940]   - Well, you know what they were trying to avoid
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.180]   and why they would have never done that is
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.820]   because they would have started calling
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.740]   the United States government Zimbabwe North.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.020]   - Yeah, 'cause the, I mean, you know,
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.060]   that's what, it's a hyperinflation, right?
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.020]   - Yeah, it would have been,
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.820]   they would have had like the, you know, it would have been bad.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.860]   - I love the idea though.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.700]   - I think it's a great idea.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.740]   - And then, the biggest problem would have been the debate
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.340]   over who's picture gets to be on that coin.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.180]   - Yeah, really.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.260]   (laughing)
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.660]   - I vote for Herbert who.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.740]   - Herbert who.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.020]   - And then I get to be Dr. Evil and say,
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.660]   we should invade Fort Knox and steal.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.060]   I can't turn around in this chair.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.660]   The one trillion dollar coin.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.660]   (laughing)
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.860]   And then suddenly, no, and then suddenly a new movie
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.620]   starring probably the modern, either one of those Sarah kids,
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:00.700]   one of the kids from Glee,
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.340]   one of the new Jack Black is,
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.620]   saying, "You knew how the myth he buys a soda,
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.860]   "the vending machine realized that,
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.460]   "oh no, I just put the new trillion dollar coin
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.860]   "in the soda machine."
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.060]   - I think there's a movie idea.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.460]   I hope you're writing a script right now.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.540]   - I got a spec script that's actually very similar to that.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.860]   If I can get a pitch meeting in with Universal,
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.060]   I'm sure that we can sell this.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.940]   - The trillion dollar coin.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.540]   It's a Disney movie, it's great, I love it.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.580]   - Yeah, you don't let that one get stolen at all.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.580]   - That's a great idea.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:33.260]   - Pepsi, we get Pepsi and Coke Coke,
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.340]   but against each other to get the naming rights, it's...
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.460]   - Adam or Andy, do you know anything about this,
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.300]   Super Wifi, this 802.22?
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.140]   - Yeah.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.460]   - What's the story there?
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.580]   - The idea was this was a standard that was proposed
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.260]   a few years ago to solve the problem of
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.020]   how do you get broadband into rural areas?
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.780]   So it is a super long distance version of Wifi.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.180]   - 60 miles.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.020]   - Right, exactly.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.340]   So you can basically build a little tower
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.340]   and essentially make sure that all these rural areas,
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.020]   especially where it's just not feasible to run cable
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.220]   or to run the network out there.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.060]   You could just basically plop up this one thing,
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.500]   put a couple of dishes up and you'll have,
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.140]   you'll have coverage of this area,
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:15.140]   especially for certain municipalities where data companies
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.220]   required to service any house that wants to have
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.060]   one of their services.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.900]   You can't just simply say,
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.060]   "We will only service the profitable areas of town,
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.540]   "the unprofitable areas, we're not gonna run cable out too."
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:30.060]   So they made the next step towards making this a real standard
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.300]   and so a lot of people pick this up to say,
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.380]   "Oh, well, that's great, that means that I can be
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.140]   "anywhere within like three miles of my house
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.740]   "and still have access to my home network."
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.980]   Well, no, because it really wasn't built,
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.300]   it wasn't designed to be something where you just
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.380]   plug this into your cable box and then turn it on
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.340]   and look for the, wait for the yellow light to turn green
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.540]   and you've got a network.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.140]   Also, it certainly wasn't designed.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.580]   You can't have a transmitter of that kind of power
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.780]   in every single house or even every third house
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.900]   in a neighborhood and expect birds not to explode
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.700]   in mid-air.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.940]   This is funny, 'cause this is what YMAX was supposed to do,
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.100]   was to provide kind of internet to rural areas
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.940]   that wasn't cost-effective to run cable to.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.620]   Well, the other thing, I mean, this is the first
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.780]   I've heard of this particular thing,
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.020]   but I actually ran a long range wireless connection
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.660]   for a number of years.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.460]   Highly directional, right, you aim it.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.940]   Yeah, highly directional, you just, you know,
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.140]   well, it's not so much that it's highly directional,
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.460]   it's that you have to be line of sight.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.340]   And so as long as you're within line of sight
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.220]   and you just point your parabolic antenna
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:33.340]   in the right direction until you get the signal right
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.260]   and then you lock it down.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.700]   So, I mean, we were going three miles or so
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:41.660]   with, and that was one megabit wireless,
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.540]   802.11G, no, B, sorry, I have to go backwards.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.060]   Wow, that's impressive.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.740]   Yeah, so it just worked.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.180]   I mean, it was not a problem.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.900]   So, you know, I don't know quite what they're doing here.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.460]   I'm sort of reading the article really quickly.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.140]   They're not saying whether or not it's, you know,
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.700]   they're avoiding the line of sight issues
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.460]   or again, what the power issues were.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.460]   We didn't have to boost power.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.140]   I just cannibalized a loosened waveland card
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.380]   from an old airport base station
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.900]   and, you know, plugged it into a parabolic antenna,
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.180]   which sounds a little easier than it actually was,
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.060]   but, you know, it did.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.900]   Yeah, well, we see an hackers do that.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.260]   In fact, DEF CON, they did,
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.540]   how many kilometers was it?
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.220]   I mean, they were, they were at 20 kilometers
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.060]   or something like that.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.220]   You can go a long way.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.460]   It's just a matter of the power
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.380]   and the antennas that you put in.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.260]   This just in from Milmock in our chat room,
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.940]   there is a $1 million coin in Canada.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.820]   Yeah, in May 2007, the Royal Canadian Mint
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:38.540]   issued a gold maple leaf coin with a face value
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.820]   of $1 million.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.580]   It's 100 kilograms of gold.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.180]   Why did they do that?
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.420]   This is mainly a promotional product.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.740]   (laughs)
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.060]   It's not a tuning, it's not a tuning, what's the name of it?
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.780]   That's for the man who has everything.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.460]   100 kilograms.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.740]   You don't want to, that's 200 pounds.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   It's a 20 pounds.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.020]   It's a Mooney.
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.100]   It's a Mooney, I like it.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.780]   Yeah, we got a Tooney and we got a Mooney.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.220]   Wow, so thank you Milmock.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.140]   Oh, thank you, Milmock.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.300]   So it's not the first type time they've done something like that.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.100]   You couldn't fit that into a Coke machine, though.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:10.940]   (laughs)
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:11.780]   I don't think.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.300]   So, and by the way, I stand corrected,
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.860]   according to the chat and according to Wikipedia,
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.940]   it's $228 billion worth of gold in Fort Knox.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:20.780]   I guess doesn't count.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.620]   Whoa!
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.460]   Liquid assets.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.700]   I guess not 'cause Apple doesn't have that much.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.540]   Yes.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.140]   Wow, I guess this story is bogus.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.620]   Yeah, 'cause we're not tied to gold and they're not liquid.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.700]   You can't get it out.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.940]   I guess you.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:34.780]   What are you gonna do?
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.700]   I've tried often.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.140]   (laughs)
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   The new MacBook Air, we are now learning from Anand Tech,
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.900]   has a smaller, cheaper, Thunderbolt controller,
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.660]   but it's limited to a single external display.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.940]   So, I think this is good news, though,
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.500]   that there are a variety of Thunderbolt components.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.780]   I mean, the idea that you can have a cheaper one means--
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.620]   Okay, it's sort of interesting.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.860]   There's a cheaper one before there's more of a,
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.980]   like, a third peripheral, so.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.820]   Right.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.660]   Right.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.020]   You know, and the cable still costs 50 bucks.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.340]   Yeah, that's just outrageous.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.740]   That's ridiculous.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.420]   Maybe this'll make its way into the cable, too,
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.980]   and that'll have cables come down to the third stuff.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.860]   The reason Anand says this is important
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.380]   is because PC makers are very price sensitive, as you know.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.820]   And so they're not gonna put Thunderbolt into PCs
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.860]   unless they can get a cheap chip.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.420]   So this is the kind of thing that maybe
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.540]   PC manufacturers would use to make Thunderbolt a more
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.580]   universal standard.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.020]   I think that would be great.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.620]   Well, they also got a boost from Intel,
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.780]   'cause now they promote a new standard.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.180]   They essentially just looked at the MacBook Air
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.140]   and said, "Ooh, that's nice.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.100]   "I think we'll develop it as our own standard."
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.420]   So now they have a hard respect called the UltraBook.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.740]   That is designed to be pretty much as close to a MacBook Air
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.580]   as you possibly can get Ultra Thin,
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:51.460]   also using standard-sandy bridge processors,
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.580]   using SSDs for storage.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.940]   And so when you get, it's the weird thing about Thunderbolt
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.260]   is that it's such a broad-stroke solution
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.580]   to a whole bunch of problems when you're trying to build
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.700]   something that's nice and thin,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.740]   but usable for so many things.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.140]   It is essentially like having a tower Mac with a PCI bus,
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.860]   because it means that you can have pretty much
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.260]   any peripheral you want just by adding in a dongle.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.060]   Most people are not gonna even care about having
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.260]   a gigabit ethernet, for instance, on MacBook Air,
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.100]   on the MacBook. - Yeah.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.540]   - But it means that if you are one of those people
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.820]   who are saying, "Gosh, I would buy that in a second,
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.180]   "but I absolutely need to have copper ethernet."
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.340]   Well, great find by a 30, $40, $50 dongle,
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.780]   plug it into your Thunderbolt port
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.100]   and you will have a gigabit ethernet
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.940]   or you'll have Cardbus
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.300]   or you'll have pretty much anything you want,
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   because is that flexible standard?
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.420]   So it's interesting.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.020]   I do think that it's a good horse to back.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.140]   - Yeah.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.940]   I'm glad there was something to replace fire on.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.340]   - I just wanna see some drives.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.540]   I mean, there's a couple of them, but yeah.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.020]   - We were gonna see them by now.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.780]   We didn't mean to be promised Pegasus, yeah.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.620]   - Yeah.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.940]   - Yeah, Lassie, LaSie, Sona, are the two companies
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.660]   that were really, really aggressive a few months,
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.940]   a couple months ago at least.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.300]   And it's promising that you're not,
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.140]   we're gonna have drives, we're gonna have adapters,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.660]   we're gonna have network interfaces.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.540]   None of them have, as far as I know it,
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.300]   I can ship that. - Mm-hmm.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.860]   How well is the Air doing?
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.620]   Remember they were saying, "Oh, we're gonna have to ramp up
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.380]   "production, we're gonna send 17 million Airs
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.780]   "in the first order?" - Sold out.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.620]   - It sold out?
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.340]   - I think they're having trouble with the--
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.140]   - You can still get, if you want the,
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.980]   like an 11 inch base 64 gig,
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:25.220]   two gigabyte memory air, you can get it on Amazon today.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.860]   If you want the one that everybody wants,
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.300]   they're just saying two or three week wait.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.660]   - What is the one everyone wants?
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.020]   Is it the 13? - That's the one,
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.780]   that's the, if just for the 11 inch
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.660]   that has four gigs, better processor.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.940]   - Right, that's the one I want.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.500]   Yeah, yeah, two gigs is not it.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.940]   - That one is two or three weeks wait.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.180]   - Interesting.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.020]   Wow.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.380]   And the 13 inch, I wonder how that's selling.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.420]   13 inches in stock, okay.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.660]   MacMall has it.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.500]   - I will admit that I'm very aware of the availability
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.860]   of the 11 inch Air because--
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.260]   - Are you on it?
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.940]   - I've not, no, I've just, but now I've moved on to the,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.980]   well, if I did want one,
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.660]   how long would I have any time for this trip
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.340]   I'm making in mid-September?
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.780]   Did you buy, you bought the October air?
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.420]   - I don't know any air.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.940]   - Oh, you're again a smart guy
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.940]   'cause you put these things off.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.580]   - Well, not only that, but the air didn't make a hell
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.300]   of a lot of sense to me before the 2011 editions.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.180]   The edition of, with the faster processors
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.460]   and also the Thunderbolt port,
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.340]   which means that there's not gonna be a point
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.020]   which this is gonna be a failed machine for me.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.220]   It's not gonna, I will actually be able to use it
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.420]   for pretty much anything I want to use it for while I'm traveling.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.180]   That's, the 2011's are really a significant upgrade.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.100]   I still have Apple's, right in the house right now,
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.100]   I literally have one of everything that Apple made in 2011
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.620]   all on loan and I'm doing like a big mega.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.540]   Here is the entire 2011 line.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.380]   - That's fine.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.620]   - Round up review.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.940]   And man, it is gonna be really,
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.340]   it's already gonna be really hard to send all the stuff back
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.180]   because I'm literally gonna have to put eight things
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.260]   boxed back up and take it down to FedEx.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.540]   But I'm talking about the idea of,
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.220]   oh, well, let's go to Panera and do some, oh,
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.340]   I have to use by 15 inch Mac Pro.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.820]   (laughing)
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.660]   - Andy, Andy, the only thing I have to ask you about
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.820]   with these tests is how is that Mac Pro treating you?
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.180]   - Which Pro does he, is that the eight way,
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.260]   Zion, no, later than this?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.660]   - Which one?
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.820]   - Everything that they've made in 2011,
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.180]   everything they've released in 2011, sir.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.940]   - I have on my desk the new iMac, the Ice and it's--
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.020]   - That's why I'm on Mac Pro, I'm sitting at it right now.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.580]   (laughing)
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.820]   - Oh, I get it, there isn't a 2011 Mac.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.140]   - Well, I mean, I'm just--
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.420]   - I was trying to get those all in the dog.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.660]   - It's hot weather.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.580]   - I get it, so they haven't released it yet,
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.060]   but the rumor is they're, see, I'm slow.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.700]   - We're just waiting, we're waiting.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.940]   - We're waiting, you're paying attention to the--
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:52.780]   - I'm just trying to-- - See, I don't think
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.100]   most people are paying any attention
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.260]   to the Thunderbolt Mac Pro.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.100]   - It's an expansion bus.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.700]   - That's such a small narrow slice.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.860]   - It is, bunch trucks, you know, no one really cares.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.740]   - I'm really happy with this new iMac though,
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.860]   I got the solid state drive in there.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.700]   - Oh yeah.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.700]   - And the i7, it's very nice.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.020]   - I wanna get some, I'm gonna get a Mac Mini,
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.020]   I think this week or next week.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.340]   - Those Mini's are sweet.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.260]   - Yeah.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.220]   - That's especially when you, have you actually seen them yet?
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.460]   - I have not seen them.
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.740]   - They're very-- - I think the profile.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.420]   - I think that Apple is, this is the first time
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.180]   what the Mini Apple is explicitly embracing
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.540]   the Mac Mini as an embedded device.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.540]   They still want, they still want to suggest it
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.620]   as a good replacement for your, whatever desktop PC you have,
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.900]   just take out this box, put in this nice trim little Apple box,
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.340]   but now they're much more explicit about saying,
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.500]   and if you want something to install on a car dashboard,
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.260]   and if you want something to drive a robot with,
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.940]   and if you want something just to use as a TV device,
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:44.060]   we have this, I think that's, as much as anything else
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.340]   is one of the reasons why they deleted the optical drive
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.780]   and made it as small and unobtrusive as anything.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:53.100]   It's like a big hyper thyroid version of the Apple TV
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:53.940]   at this point.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.100]   - Speaking of which, you can now watch Vimeo videos,
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:02.100]   software update on Monday, added Vimeo capability to Apple.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:07.940]   Also, you can stream, what is this?
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.580]   You can stream movies from the iTunes store
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.660]   without a computer being on, right?
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.660]   - Right, that's weird that it didn't do that before.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.460]   - Yeah, it's interesting, not only that,
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.100]   but they've added something kind of new
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.460]   where it used to be that if you didn't have,
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.060]   when you purchased a movie or you purchased a TV show,
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.620]   it was like any other iTunes store purchase
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.900]   where you have to keep good track of that
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.460]   if you'd lose it, you lose it.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.300]   Now it's anything you've bought in the past
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.620]   is available to you in your library
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.580]   and accessible by Apple TV.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.020]   - iCloud is, it went online today,
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.940]   the developer version, although everybody probably went
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.580]   to iCloud.com and tried to log in.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.420]   It's pretty, isn't it?
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.260]   I like this dog tag, it's some italic dog tag.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.020]   - I wonder if they're gonna send you one.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.860]   - Send me what?
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.100]   - A dog tag. - A dog tag.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.500]   - I'd love that. - That's awesome.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.340]   - That's like Steve Wozniak's business card,
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.340]   which he claims he can cut meat with.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.500]   - Here, have a business card, you can cut meat with that.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   - And that's exactly what he says.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.660]   - I have one. - Does he just,
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.300]   does he just stop by the TSA for that?
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.100]   I mean, you could cut meat with that,
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.420]   you could take a poll. - Yeah, I don't.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.580]   He doesn't say that in front of TSA, I think.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:21.380]   - But he does have to put his wallet in the little bin.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.500]   - But it's a business card.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.540]   What could be possibly go wrong?
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:30.780]   - Now see, the scary thing with Woz is that
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.580]   when you have that much money, you realize that
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.180]   there's nothing I can't, no problem I can't buy my way out of.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.380]   So you know what, I think I'll just dress as John Belushi,
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.300]   as a Sarenate Life Samurai, right through the TSA gate,
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.140]   knowing that two samurai swords,
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:45.980]   what's the worst they can do?
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.820]   Ten grand, call the lawyer.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:50.100]   - So along with the release of the beta, we now have prices.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.380]   I think fairly aggressive pricing on storage.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.700]   The default free storage is five gigabytes.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.740]   That's pretty much what everybody does.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.860]   Ten gigabytes, $20 a year.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.140]   I actually like this.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:07.940]   For it's like $15 a month for 50 gigabytes on Dropbox.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.260]   And there's nothing in between.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.020]   And I think this is a little more realistic,
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.060]   $20 for 10 gigabytes, $40 for 20 gigabytes.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.020]   And this is per year, not per month.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.100]   50 gigabytes, $100 per year.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.580]   So it's about half-foot dropbox.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.780]   - And your music doesn't count.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.620]   - Right.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.340]   - And your video doesn't count, right?
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.620]   - Photos don't purchase per month.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:27.680]   Music never counts.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.340]   - So I think this is pretty attractive.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.500]   And considering that mobile me used to cost 100 bucks
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.740]   and you get 20 gigs, it's a good deal.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.740]   - Not that I'm bitter.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.380]   - Paid for it for years.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.180]   - Yes, I paid for the extras.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:46.580]   - But it's like supporting a local band
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.700]   when they're just in Harvard Square selling cassette tapes.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.580]   You allow them to keep at it and keep the free and alive,
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.140]   unfilled and paid it big.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.340]   And now it's $500 you can't afford to go.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.780]   - We're glad we just provide Apple with an income stream
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.860]   so that they continue to do what they do.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.860]   - They're just cash-strapped.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.700]   You wanna keep on from it?
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.180]   - They need the money, Adam, yeah, exactly.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.620]   - I understand the iPad 3 is gonna be a Kickstarter project.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.620]   - It's as if those Harvard Square buskers had $76 billion,
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.740]   but they didn't wanna spend it.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.860]   - And most of the buskers in Harvard Square
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.940]   are trust fund kids.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.540]   - Yeah, they couldn't get the local McDonalds
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540]   to break that $1,000 bill.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.860]   So give me a buck so I can buy a Big Mac.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.140]   How's it been with people,
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.580]   I presume you're all using Lion compatibility issues.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:35.140]   I know Office for instance has some issues
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.420]   with Microsoft Office,
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.460]   but it's not gonna be updated for a few months.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.620]   - I was worried about that and then I realized,
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.940]   oh wait, I don't actually use Office.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.500]   I bet you nobody here does.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.060]   I know you use BBEdit, Adam,
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.220]   'cause I read your article about BBEdit.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.060]   - Yes, indeed.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.500]   - And I liked what you said about BBEdit.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.340]   Tell us about that.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.300]   - Well, as a BBEdit 10,
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   it's just, I think it almost gets a bad rap
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.380]   as a programmers editor,
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:04.460]   but the fact is that BBEdit is just a killer writing tool.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.540]   You know, it gets you right,
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.860]   it gets out of the way,
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.620]   whatever you need to be able to manipulate your text
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.300]   in some fashion, it's there.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.100]   And so we've used many word process over the years.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.740]   We used to use word fairly recently for take control books,
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.260]   but we've actually switched that over to pages.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.780]   So the whole Office and Lion thing
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.620]   isn't really affecting us either.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.460]   - Interesting, yeah.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.340]   - And yeah, so, and BBEdit 10,
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:33.340]   it was fascinating because watching what Apple did with Lion,
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.460]   were they were really trying to bring more people
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.820]   to the operating system,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.460]   that there was the sense that they wanted to make it
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.340]   interesting to people who were not currently using the Mac,
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.580]   whether they were using iOS,
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.180]   or they're coming over from Windows or whatever.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.860]   And barebones basically said,
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.820]   more feeding our happy loyal users with more power features
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.460]   and they really didn't do anything in BBEdit
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   that's gonna say,
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.220]   oh wow, you've never looked at BBEdit before,
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.500]   here's why you gotta take a look finally.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.660]   It's just if you're a BBEdit user,
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.220]   it's cooler and more powerful than ever before.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.380]   - It's interesting, compare and contrast those strategies,
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:15.020]   Apple going after non-Apple users with Lion, you say.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.460]   And I think I agree in some ways.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:21.060]   - Certainly going after the novice user.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.100]   - Look at it this way,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.340]   whether or not Apple is targeting the long standing Mac user,
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.500]   it's not an optional upgrade for the long standing Mac user.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.220]   Either you're gonna need some hardware or some software
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.300]   that you got to connect to Lion,
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.700]   or you're gonna buy a new Mac, or whatever it is.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.660]   I mean, the choice of upgrading to Lion
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.020]   is not so much if it's went.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.700]   If you're a long standing Mac user.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.100]   And so that's why I really see Lion as,
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.540]   and this is more so than with Snow Leopard
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.900]   or Leopard or anything in the past too.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:53.260]   I really, really see Apple doing much more
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.060]   of this kind of thing where iCloud's gonna require,
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.460]   probably gonna require some Lion stuff.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.740]   Apps are gonna start using it more and more.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:06.140]   Just in general, Lion, I think is gonna be hard to avoid.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.860]   - Do we think that Lion is the last paid upgrade
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.060]   that Apple's gonna do?
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:15.020]   - Wait, it's 30 bucks now, it's almost free as it is.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.580]   30 bucks for kind of all the Macs you have around.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.060]   - Right, I mean, I think this is--
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.780]   - What are they gonna do with subscription Mac?
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.900]   - I don't think they need to do a subscription.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.980]   I think that they make so much money on the OS
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.980]   and everyone buying applications in the platform.
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.260]   I think they could just give it away.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.780]   I mean, I don't think that they,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.700]   I don't think they need to charge for it anymore.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.220]   Other than there's a Starbucks Oxling,
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.740]   I mean, Sarbanes Oxling, that'd be the only reason.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.620]   I mean, that's why they charge like it's for accounting
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.980]   for accounting reasons.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.460]   - Yeah, they can't give it away.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:44.380]   - Yeah, that's another area
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.700]   in which I usually have to lean on my seeing eye nerds.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.540]   - Right.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.300]   - That turns out the way they structure the company,
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.740]   the way they're gonna report their profits,
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.780]   they can't simply give away things of value
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   or else they have to sort of claim it as a loss against some.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.340]   If they give you something that anybody would tell you
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.820]   is worth $50, then they have to report it
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.700]   as we lost $50 on this transaction or stuff like that.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:09.180]   - I mean, I think $30 for kind of unlimited installs
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.660]   is about as free as you can get.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.540]   - Yeah.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.380]   - I mean, that's--
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.860]   - Well, and that's partly why I suggest the subscription model
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.500]   because once they've got a subscription model,
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.980]   then they can give the stuff away as well as--
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.380]   - Ah, I get it.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.380]   - And so, and if you wanna take it
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.860]   to the next logical extreme, how come the MacBook Air
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:26.420]   doesn't have, well, 3G or obviously coming forward?
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.820]   - 4G. - Would you love to see that?
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.380]   - And so at that point, you could really see
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.660]   a subscription Mac.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.260]   - It really feels like it should, you know,
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.580]   'cause instead of taking my iPad with me lately,
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.060]   I've been taking my error with me.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.660]   And the nice thing about the iPad is
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.100]   you knew you'd always be connected
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.100]   and you just kind of make that assumption.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.620]   Oh yeah, this will always be connected.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.740]   And then you get there and you go, "Oh, I forgot.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.220]   "This is not 3G."
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.060]   - Right.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:49.980]   - It should be 3G.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.260]   - Well, and the other thing that,
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.660]   from a subscription perspective, you know,
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.020]   now that everything's coming out in the App Store,
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.980]   the question is, "What will Apple upgrade
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.300]   "and when will they charge you for it?"
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.100]   I mean, the theory, they already have you now in the log
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.300]   where they could just start upgrading line, adding features,
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.740]   doing whatever they're gonna do
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.940]   as just part of the upgrade path whenever they want.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.780]   Rather than having it--
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.180]   - Charging a book for the new--
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.340]   - Well, not even charge a book.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.900]   Just, there's a new upgrade, boom.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.420]   I hit it and I added these features.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.540]   - Well, realize that Apple, Apple doesn't even,
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.340]   Apple doesn't even like music subscriptions at this point.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.180]   - Right.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:21.020]   - So I think it's kind of a leap to think
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.740]   that they'll start to sell system software that way.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.580]   - I'm saying they don't need to.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.340]   They could just start updating line,
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.260]   ongoingly, and never charge you again.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.900]   It could just be line for quite some time.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.300]   I mean, you know, it doesn't, they don't,
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.340]   now that they have this upgrade capability,
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.380]   same thing with Final Cut X.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.780]   I mean, I think that's the one thing that no one knows yet
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.560]   is maybe Apple's just gonna keep on,
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   you know, maybe they're just going to just keep on updating it.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.000]   - Oh, I don't know.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.120]   - So, okay.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:49.960]   - So--
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.200]   - It's just such a basic tenant of philosophy.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.080]   I mean, I was talking to a developer recently
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.280]   who decided that, who decided that,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.840]   they just came up with a big update for Lion
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   and they're trying to figure out,
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.320]   do we charge our old users for an upgrade,
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.720]   or do we charge our existing users an upgrade fee,
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.520]   or do we simply lower the price of the product
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.840]   in general and say, every time we do something,
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.640]   do a big update like this,
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.200]   got a big whole number figure release,
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.880]   we are simply going to have you buy a brand new edition,
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.440]   so now you can buy through the App Store,
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.680]   you can buy through our website,
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.120]   whatever you wanna do, where the people,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.920]   and they're still gonna be people
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.440]   who are using this product for the past three or four years,
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.480]   who are gonna say, how come I had to spend $25
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.200]   for a whole new copy?
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.360]   - Yes, but the last time we had you upgrade, it cost $28.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.560]   - I don't care, what loyalty has to do with anything,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.880]   so a lot of things for these.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.960]   - A couple of things, I wanna point out,
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.120]   real quickly from the chatroom,
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.120]   one is that Apple has in effect said
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.120]   that they are gonna do incremental upgrades
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.360]   because they haven't booked the full amount of money
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.960]   they're making on new Macs.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.080]   And two, Bob in our chatroom said,
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.600]   Apple changed the way they're doing their accounting,
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.160]   witnessed the fact that Xcode,
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.560]   which was briefly $5 for that reason
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.920]   that you spoke of Andy, is now free.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.880]   I see it's free.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.400]   - And I think-- - Which pisses me off
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.720]   'cause I paid five bucks.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   (laughing)
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.880]   I want that latte back.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.320]   - Oh my latte back.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.040]   - Yeah, the thing is I think that for many developers,
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.400]   including us, I think it makes sense
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.240]   to have incremental upgrades and to charge for them
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.280]   and make it less expensive.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.440]   I mean, we're already looking at the plugins
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.520]   that we do for Final Cut are gonna be less expensive
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.200]   and so on and so forth, but I think for Apple,
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.640]   who sells hardware and makes money on every person
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.960]   that has the new operating system,
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.080]   I think it could make a lot of sense
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.880]   for them not to bother and just keep on saying,
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.600]   well, we're just gonna keep on updating these,
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.920]   updating our software that way
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.360]   and making the platform more powerful
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.040]   because they're selling hardware.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.560]   - So actually you have to install the new Xcode
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.400]   because the Xcode that I have on here requires Snow Leopard.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.080]   So I need to go to 4.0, you see that?
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.480]   I was-- - That's very complicated.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.760]   - Yeah, so I have Xcode 4.0 too and it says,
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.600]   "No, you have to have Snow Leopard."
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.720]   So you gotta go to 4.1 and they're making that for free.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.560]   Interesting.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.400]   Hey, we gotta take a break, but we're gonna come back
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.200]   with more, whether our great panel, our esteemed panel.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.320]   In fact, we're gonna do something new.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.320]   Eileen, who was it?
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.240]   Was it just somebody emailed us and suggested?
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.440]   She answered me. - It was on G+,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   and I believe I wrote the name of the person.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.480]   Maybe not. - And there, did you?
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.040]   Okay, so somebody on Google+ suggested
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.960]   that we start doing two things on the show
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.360]   and I think it's great 'cause we do it on our other shows,
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.880]   a Lion Tip of the Week and an iOS Tip of the Week.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.000]   So we got an iOS tip from Alex
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.760]   and a Lion Tip from Andy,
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.720]   and of course our regular picks of the week coming up.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.800]   Adam Anks is also here.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.240]   If you like tips is to take control E-book series,
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.840]   tells you how to use just pretty much everything.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.280]   It's not just Mac either, right?
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.560]   - No, we focus on the Mac stuff,
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.720]   but we have a lot of iPad and iOS iPhone books as well.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.040]   So we've branched out into other things
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.120]   a couple of times, but realistically,
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.680]   people don't come looking to us for books
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.000]   on how to cook Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.840]   much as it's a good book.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.280]   - Yeah, exactly 'cause that was the funny thing I thought,
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.120]   'cause we did the same thing.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.400]   You know, we had a food program for a while.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.920]   And then you started doing like take control
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.880]   of your taxes, of your paperless office,
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   of your turkey things.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.440]   - Paperless office has been huge.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.000]   - Has it? - People love that book.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.040]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.760]   - Because that is Mac stuff or, you know,
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.200]   computer stuff where you're saying,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.760]   how the heck do I get rid of all this crud on my desk?
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.800]   And it's not, you know,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.560]   you gotta put together the hardware and the software
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.960]   and the procedures and you know, what can you do?
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.000]   So Joe Kistle's done a fabulous job on that.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   So that's been really good for us.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.680]   But yeah, take control of Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.280]   - That's a lot, huh?
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.720]   - A couple of people have had really good
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.240]   Thanksgiving dinners with it.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.720]   (laughing)
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.880]   Including us, 'cause we're both every year.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.280]   - Take control books.com if you want.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.000]   No more about Adam's great.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.120]   Take control books.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.080]   Now, can I talk to you a little bit about it?
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.320]   I know Andy will be happy to hear this audible.com.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.160]   I finally finished, I had an 83 hour audio book.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   - What was that?
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.400]   - It was the trilogy, the Void Trilogy by Peter F. Hamper,
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.280]   who is one of my favorite authors of all.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.160]   It's a fantastic book, but I finally finished it.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.000]   And now Andy, I'm reading Endgame,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.720]   the Bobby Fisher book that you recommend.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.280]   And then you're right, it's absolutely wonderful.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.720]   I know, we're just audible fanatics here at Twit.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.200]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.520]   you could sign up for Audible yourself.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.240]   Get that gold account, that's a book a month.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.560]   First month's free.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.480]   - I just don't know how you're listening to Mac's break
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.600]   and you haven't,
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.440]   I know.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.280]   - At least gotten a free book out of this field.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280]   - Look at this one, Moneyball.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.960]   This was one of the great books of all time.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.880]   They're now making a movie.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.680]   I never thought they'd make a movie at a Moneyball.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   But it's the story of how Brian Sabian at the A's.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.240]   And who was it?
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.080]   - Billy Bean.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.240]   - Billy Bean at the A's and Brian and Sabian's,
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.080]   of course, the Giants.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.960]   And who was it on the Red Sox
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.080]   that he would talk about in here?
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:50.920]   I can't remember.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.160]   But Billy Bean at the A's used statistics and numbers
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:59.160]   to understand the magic of building a great team.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.560]   And it's just fantastic.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.080]   And of course now it's all Moneyball.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.480]   Every team has read this book.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.080]   But if you hadn't, you should.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.120]   And I'm sure Andy, you have a recommendation for us too.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.960]   I like to overwhelm people with all the great stuff
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.800]   we can get here.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.120]   What do you have for us?
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:16.240]   - Yeah, I've got like a sort of a substitution here.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.960]   I've bought two books in the past couple of weeks.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.280]   One is a new book by Grant Morrison
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.560]   that I had to take a little break from.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.200]   It's not that it was a bad book.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.760]   It's just that I'm trying to figure out
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.240]   whether or not I don't like it
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.120]   or whether it's just that, look,
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.040]   I really need to pull over the car right now
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.720]   and just sit and listen and try to make sense
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   of what he's saying here.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   - He's talking about comic books?
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720]   - It's essentially an extended musing
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.040]   about the nature of superheroes in our society,
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.600]   how the comic industry works and how they relate
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.760]   to basic classical storytelling.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.840]   And I will admit that part of it is not sinking in.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.120]   And so I'm not done with it yet.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.760]   And I'm not ready to say whether or not I like it
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.560]   or don't like it anymore.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.720]   Part of it is that I think that Grant Morrison
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.720]   has a writing style that works great when you read it
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:17.360]   as text, but you are very aware of all the extra words
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.640]   when someone is forced to read it aloud to you.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.360]   And you're driving and you're trying to figure out,
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.640]   okay, should I slow down because I think the light
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.760]   is gonna change or should I just keep on going
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   and hope that I make the act?
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.200]   That's a lot to do while someone is saying,
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.160]   meanwhile, the bark of the tree being bread, brown,
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.000]   the orange and--
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.920]   - Some books are better for audio.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.840]   - Yeah.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.200]   - So I'll finish it and at some future date,
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.280]   just to make sure that people know
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.240]   that I don't just automatically recommend
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.440]   every single book that I get.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   - He actually reads them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.520]   (laughing)
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.800]   - With his real list.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.360]   Either I listen to, either I start off reading them
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.640]   on Kindle and then I get the Audible book
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.000]   to see if the Audible book is good enough
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.840]   to recommend as an Audible pick.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.520]   But so I decided to take a break with a book
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.400]   that I'm really digging by Gordon S. Wood.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.800]   It's called The Idea of America.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.240]   And David McCulloch is probably the most famous person
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.800]   who writes about American history.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.200]   He wrote the book on John Adams about Truman,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.360]   about the bridges, really cool stuff.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.120]   Gordon S. Wood is doing some really great stuff.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.800]   He focuses on the American Revolution,
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.200]   what he self-distainingly calls like the dull parts,
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   which is 1776 to about 1820, 1830.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.920]   He's written a bunch of books on this period.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.400]   His latest book is really cool
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.320]   'cause it's a collection of essays,
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.680]   which means that it's a perfect thing for reading,
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.360]   for listening to an audio.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.800]   'Cause you can go through one chapter in one commute,
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.320]   go through another chapter in another commute,
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.480]   another one where you're just sitting at home
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.880]   and kicking back.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.960]   But what I really love about it is that
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.760]   he takes a really different approach
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.640]   from what you might have heard in school
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.040]   and what a lot of even popular commentators
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.120]   really go for in the American Revolution.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.480]   He really goes down to here are the ideas
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.000]   that these men believed at that time.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.920]   Here is what made up these people.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.400]   So when they're talking about conflicts between
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.120]   between the colonies and the crown,
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.560]   they're not talking about, oh, well,
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.160]   they thought that taxes were unfair
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.800]   and that they're being made to prop up a falling empire.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.200]   It's no, it's more like they felt
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.720]   as though they already had a working country here,
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.320]   that they had some sort of divine right to be here
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.000]   that was independent of outside influence
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.360]   and therefore that outside influence was superfluous.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.320]   And he's not one of the,
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.080]   and he's also doesn't take the attitude of,
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.280]   well, other people are getting it wrong,
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.440]   I'm getting it right.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.080]   It's more like, here's my perspective
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.560]   and here's why I believe things went down the way they did
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.320]   and here's why I think that the attitudes and ideas
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.600]   that went into the founding of the country
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.760]   have a knock on effect and sometimes they're amplified
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.120]   by modern events and sometimes they're being misinterpreted
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.240]   and abused by modern events.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.200]   At any rate, perfect, like it's like,
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.520]   it's instead of like one big giant Hershey bar,
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.960]   it's like a bowl full of fun-size Halloween candy
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.520]   where you can just pop a few in your mouth
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.840]   and just have that wonderful experience
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.160]   and then the next day pop another few in your mouth
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.760]   and without having to feel as though
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.360]   you're absolutely committed to getting through
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.960]   beginning and middle and end of a book
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.400]   or a week or two-week period.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.680]   I really am enjoying it.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.400]   I'm about a third of the way through it,
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.760]   which is usually the point in which I can say,
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.400]   yes, I'm gonna like the rest of this too
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.480]   so I can start recommending this.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.320]   - Sounds great.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.520]   The idea of America, Gordon S. Wood.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.040]   Now there's two books, three actually,
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.240]   if you include the one Andy's not sure about,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.040]   that you could get for free right now.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.640]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.000]   You're signing up for that gold account,
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.440]   that's a book a month, first month's free,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.120]   first book's free, yours to keep forever,
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.400]   cancel it anytime.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.800]   And you know, while we were talking,
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.840]   you pulled us to the Super God's book
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:48.280]   and I saw another audible recommendation right under it
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.640]   that looks really good, fire and rain,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.000]   the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor,
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.240]   Crosby Stills and Nash, and the Lost Story of 1970.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.640]   See, I wanna read that.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.000]   This is the problem with audible,
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.200]   is that you browse around here.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.000]   It's like the best bookstore in the world, 75,000 titles.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.600]   And from now on, when you're sitting in the car
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.320]   in a commute or you're at the gym on the Stairmaster
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.400]   or you're cleaning house, that's not lost to time.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.320]   It's time you could use reading.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.960]   I want you to try it, it's fantastic.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.320]   audible.com/macbreak.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.160]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.000]   We're gonna try out our new feature right now.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.200]   And Adam, pitch in if you feel like it,
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.440]   if you feel the urge, our lion tip of the week,
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.240]   we begin with Andy and not go.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.480]   - Okay, this is something that I just learned
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.080]   a few days ago and the midst of being really frustrated
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.840]   with lion because there are a bunch of new concepts
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.400]   that apples really decided to articulate strongly in lion.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.320]   One of them is that if you're a consumer,
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.440]   let's hide things away that will only cause you confusion
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.360]   or it will lead you to get into trouble.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.040]   So there are a lot of features that you're used to using
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.920]   in Mac OS 10 from release after release after release.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.800]   I was surprised when I was trying to get an app to,
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.560]   a bulky app to work again,
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.840]   but I could not find my user library folder.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.000]   - They don't throw me crazy, they've hidden it.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.440]   - Right, they've hidden away.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.920]   And it's a basic technique.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.720]   If you double click on an app, try to launch it,
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.600]   it launches then immediately dies.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.440]   - Where are they?
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.280]   - Well, the first thing you do is, well,
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.640]   let's go into my user library folder,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.120]   get that apps, press file, drop it onto the desktop,
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.080]   and then try to launch it again.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.800]   If that press file has been compromised in some way,
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.120]   the app will build a brand new one
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.400]   'cause if you can't find it, maybe it'll get things working.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.640]   But you can get your, so in lion,
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.280]   you cannot see your library folder.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.720]   What you can do is, and here's, now here's,
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.680]   actually you're doing exactly the right thing,
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.040]   you've got the gold menu, now hold down the option key
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:43.880]   and watch out what happens.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.200]   - Ha!
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.800]   - And it causes your library folder to magically appear.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   And so now you can--
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.520]   - Let's do it again, go keep holding it down, select it.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.360]   - And it will.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.680]   - Amazing, so actually that's probably smart.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.320]   Windows does similar things where they hide user,
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.880]   from the users, the system folders,
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.400]   it could really mess you up.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.480]   - It annoys me, but I have to admit
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.920]   that it goes down to the point of,
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.400]   if you know about the library folder,
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.800]   it's not gonna really confuse you
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.000]   to have to look to find out how to get it back again.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.160]   And also that's only one of a different,
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.880]   that's only the easiest way you can get it back.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.720]   You can always go to command line,
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.240]   during the, even in the go menu,
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.920]   you can simply type tilde slash library,
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.920]   and you know enough that that's the actual Unix path
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.800]   to your library folder, so you can get it that way.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.880]   But there is this hidden trick
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.680]   that will let you get it pretty quickly and pretty quickly.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.880]   - That's a good one, and very important,
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.160]   I think hiding the library is really confusing to me.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.840]   - And this is something that I actually wrote an article
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.680]   about in Tibbets, and so two other aspects of that tip.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   One is, if you want access to your library folder frequently,
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.960]   you can just drag the icon of it
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.000]   into your sidebar or your toolbar.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.280]   So get access to it quickly there.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:57.040]   Or in the article that I did, which you can find on Tibbets.com,
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.960]   just do a search on hidden library,
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.480]   there is a terminal command,
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.200]   where you can just make it visible again,
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.920]   so it's just like it always was.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.760]   - Ah, okay.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.400]   One of them com-right terminal commands I hate.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.840]   - It's actually CH flags, you're changing the Unix attributes
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:12.680]   to it.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.360]   - Oh, of course, so they're using a flag
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.320]   and attributes to hide it, you could just hide it.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.840]   - Now, what's really funny about this though,
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.080]   is they didn't hide the system library folder
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.040]   or the top-level library folder.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.200]   Or of course you have to authenticate to get into,
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.440]   but as long as you're hiding the one that you don't have
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.680]   to authenticate, why wouldn't you hide the ones you do?
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.160]   - I don't know what that is. - I think that kind of makes sense
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.480]   because a consumer is not necessarily gonna leave
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.200]   his or her own home folder.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.400]   I think that I have run into that confusion
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.800]   with new users before, where they assume that,
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.720]   oh, well, library, that's where I keep my books,
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.280]   that's where I keep personal information.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.120]   - Stop putting documents there.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.480]   - No, no, no, that's system stuff.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.600]   You don't have to put them down to the code.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.440]   - And I have people that,
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.640]   we have people at the office that install plugins
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640]   and other stuff into the wrong library.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.880]   They put it on their own library
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.800]   and then not everybody has access to it
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.760]   across all the systems. - Don't get me wrong,
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.280]   I'm not saying that Apple shouldn't have hidden
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.040]   the user level library, I just find it funny
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.920]   that they left visible the other two.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.040]   - Right, right, right.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.640]   Now an iOS tip of the week from Alex Lindsay.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.840]   - So this was pretty simple,
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.760]   but I've been asked about it four times
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.640]   in the last couple of weeks
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.960]   and so I figured this would be a good one to start with.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.800]   All right, so.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.120]   - It's not very complicated.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.640]   In this is-- - Do you wanna plug your--
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.240]   - Here, we have the HDMI connector for you.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.120]   - Oh, is that the right one?
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.400]   - Oh, but your iPad's dead.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.560]   - No, I've got an iPad.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.760]   - I charged it.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.640]   - Oh, you charged it?
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.560]   - Well, we were-- - You're pretty magical.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.720]   I'm a magical fellow here, look at this.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.280]   I was speaking of magical.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.800]   We now have a cable that comes out of the table.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.880]   It's a table cable.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.400]   (laughing)
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.000]   I feel like the cat in the hat.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.440]   - It's hers. - It only comes out so far.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.800]   - Doesn't go out very far then.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.040]   All right, there we go.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.560]   So now we'll be able to see his iPad, I think.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.440]   Can you see it?
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.920]   - Well, my monitors back here
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.720]   have been flickering on and off,
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.520]   but no, I don't see it.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.360]   - That's so much.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.200]   - That's a little more tiling Rivera, by the way.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.320]   - I'm plugging, I'm plugging back here.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   - Who is the voice of God on this show?
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.240]   - Okay, plugging back here. - The producer.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.920]   - And Alex Gumpel's run over.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.560]   Jammer P is running over.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.400]   (laughing)
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.800]   - I'm the engineer, he's gonna take to turn on an iPad.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.160]   Wow, look at that.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.000]   There you go.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.040]   So this is the, so my,
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.600]   the person actually found this for my wife was my son,
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.040]   my three-year-old son.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.880]   - So he's a more adept user now than anybody in the world.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.600]   - My kids are very frightening.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.440]   - That's amazing.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.680]   - All of all ages.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.440]   So anyway, so if you, of course,
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.440]   you know that if you double click on the home button,
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.480]   you're going to be able to see all your applications here.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.520]   - Yes.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.960]   - And so you can, you know, quit applications
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.800]   and so on and so forth.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.520]   But what confused my wife,
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.840]   and then a couple of people that have asked me is that,
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.680]   if you go, if you swipe to the right,
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.040]   you get this other interface,
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.960]   and of course you have this little lock.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.000]   And this is what, but this is, this is,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.860]   if you have kids, they will find this extremely quick
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.080]   and because they're always hitting the home button.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.300]   And I've actually, I was talking to someone at the airport.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.520]   I was talking to, you know, someone else at an event
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.320]   and they were like, I don't understand how, you know,
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.240]   how to-- - I can't rotate my Mac anymore.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.680]   - Yeah, you know, it was working a second ago.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.760]   This is the button that you're looking for.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.600]   - It's not funny.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:14.440]   - And it's great.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.560]   - I use it all the time when I'm doing stuff where I don't,
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.240]   I just, I need it to stop.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.080]   - Right.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.960]   - You know, and so I, this is a very simple one.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.280]   We'll get more complicated in the future,
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.880]   but I felt like this is a real basic one
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.720]   that it was actually catching people that I knew.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.420]   And I will admit that I didn't know it was there until
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.380]   six months ago. - Double tap the home icon
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.300]   and slide to the right. - Double tap the home icon
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.120]   and then slide over and of course you have brightness
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.940]   controls and you have your play and sound,
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:43.780]   but you also have the ability to lock your screen
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:46.500]   the way it is right now so that it won't rotate.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.500]   And then you can-- - And by the way,
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.900]   if you want to send us a Mac break tips for Lion or iOS,
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.820]   I'm sure these guys would love having a little research help.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:01.260]   - I'd like to give credit to Todd Prophet on G Plus.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.260]   - Thank you, Todd.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.500]   That was his idea to do this.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.820]   And you can email Todd Prophet and let him know.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:09.020]   No, email, what should we do, Eileen?
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.940]   Do we have, I don't know if we haven't addressed yet
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.380]   that we do that. - We don't have one.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.180]   - Why don't you email Leo@twit.tv in the interim
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:18.220]   and then we'll get a Mac break at Twit.tv.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:22.420]   You know, it's, it's so depressing is that we moved our
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.300]   email, Twit.tv email from our own email server
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.660]   to Google Docs. - How's that working for you?
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.860]   - It turns out that you can only have a certain number
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:33.340]   of email addresses before you start paying for them.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.420]   - Oh yeah, we pay for them and they don't work very well.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:38.420]   - And it was, you know, we had hundreds of email addresses
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.340]   at Twit.tv because we could just spawn new ones
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:41.460]   anytime we wanted to.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.420]   It was very simple.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:45.380]   So now I think we've, I don't know if we've lost control
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.420]   of them, I wish we hadn't done that.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.100]   - Remember you can do if you want to do this like Mac break
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.060]   plus something. - Right.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:56.700]   - Okay, do that, do Leo plus Mac break at Twit.tv.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.540]   There you go. - There you go.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.100]   - And then I'll be able to filter them out
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.900]   and then extend them on to Andy and Alex.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.700]   That's a great idea, thank you Adam.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.580]   - There's another tip.
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.380]   - He's taking control.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:07.180]   That's a Gmail only tip, although it was working
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.900]   on a number of mail servers.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.820]   Leo plus Mac break at Twit.tv.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.540]   But now it's time for our picks of the week Adam.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.540]   Why don't you, why don't you start?
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.060]   - Well, if you were talking about Lion tips,
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.060]   we of course did some articles about Lion and tidbits.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:26.980]   But it was a little awkward in some respects because,
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.860]   you know, we said, "Yeah, here's some of our favorite features
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.700]   in Lion."
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.460]   But on the other hand, we also wrote this 170 page book
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.220]   called "Take and Roll of Using Lion,"
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:37.020]   which has way more detail.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.420]   Let me get fit into a tidbits article.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.340]   Similarly, way more detail than anyone could,
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:44.380]   could hope to convey quickly in a, in a video podcast
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.140]   or the like.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.060]   So take control of using Lion and a companion guide
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.140]   for those who haven't already.
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.380]   Take control of upgrading to Lion.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:54.140]   Surprisingly popular book this year,
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.500]   we'd worried that upgrading to Lion
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.700]   was going to be so easy through the Mac App Store
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.540]   that no one was going to want help.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:04.460]   But it turns out that all of Joe Kessel's incredibly hard work
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:08.780]   and more test installations than you can count really
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:09.620]   were helpful people.
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.620]   People have been, have been very nervous
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.860]   about upgrading to Lion.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:16.260]   And so he helps people walk you through clean installs,
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.140]   installing over Tiger and Leopard, that kind of thing.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:21.820]   So it's, if you need to do something a little bit
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.500]   out of the ordinary or you're just kind of confused,
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.620]   take control of upgrading to Lion really helps there.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.100]   And then Matt Newberg's "Take control of using Lion"
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.580]   goes through all the new features.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.140]   And the features we're used to because you're using Lion
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:36.300]   and there's some snow leopard and leopard features
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.180]   that are still left over.
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.900]   So you got to use those as well.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.300]   How much are those books?
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.180]   Those are each $15 or if you buy them together
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.660]   as a 20% discount.
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.540]   Take control of upgrading to Lion.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.260]   Take control of using Lion as always.
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.460]   It's nice because there are eBooks
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.700]   you could put them on your iPad or your iPhone.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:53.900]   Or you could desktop.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:56.740]   - We have the EPUB and Moby as well as PDFs.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.900]   So you can read them any which way you want.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:34:59.740]   - That's really sweet.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:01.300]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.140]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:07.300]   - So I'm doing a couple things that I was just talking
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:10.140]   to someone about my favorite apps on a flight.
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.460]   And so a little of this is a Redux
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.700]   and one of them is a brand new release.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:14.940]   One of them is SketchUp Pro.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.740]   I just want to remind people it's free.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.380]   - SketchUp Pro is free.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.580]   We use it, Brent and I actually modeled the entire
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.660]   Twit studio in it.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.260]   And I use it all the time to figure out
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.340]   where we're going to put cameras
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:28.180]   and how we're going to set stuff.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.060]   If you want to sketch out ideas, just remember it is free
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.540]   and it's really easy to use.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.500]   And if you're not, there's a pro version of course
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.340]   that you can out-
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:37.940]   - So you said SketchUp Pro is free.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.340]   - No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.140]   - SketchUp Pro is not free.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.380]   SketchUp is free, but SketchUp has almost all the stuff
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.380]   that SketchUp Pro has.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.820]   - It's a 3D drawing program.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:46.820]   - It's a 3D drawing program.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.980]   And it's just, it is such a great way to play with 3D.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.340]   There are so many great tools in it.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.780]   If you're trying to figure out how,
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.140]   just how you're going to block things out.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.900]   And there's, one of the secrets of SketchUp
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.180]   is that you can download models from the 3D warehouse.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.220]   There's thousands of models.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:04.340]   Like I put in like Kino flows and lights and cameras.
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.260]   I don't model those.
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.020]   I just go up to the thing and download them.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.620]   They all come in, generally all come in at scale,
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.940]   like the proper scale and everything else.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.100]   So all the models get along together.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.420]   It's just a really, really great app to have.
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.700]   So SketchUp is one, the other one that I was talking
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.660]   to someone about that I've just started to really use
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.700]   a lot is Sketch.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:21.540]   You love Sketch.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.100]   - I am a Sketch fan.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:23.940]   - It was funny.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.500]   You know, Keith was here a while ago
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.740]   and he's like, are you using SketchMunch?
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.540]   And I'm like, well, I like the idea, but I don't really,
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.580]   you know, and now what I'm doing is using it
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.340]   to annotate lots of stuff to email out.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:36.180]   Like after we do live events,
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.860]   I look at our bandwidth and analyze it
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.180]   with little arrows and stuff like that.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.180]   And it's just so easy.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.220]   I don't have to go into Photoshop.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.060]   I don't have to go somewhere else.
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:43.900]   You can draw little arrows, type a little text
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:44.820]   and email it to everyone.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.700]   And it's just, it's really great.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.740]   And I've been using a lot of it.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:50.100]   And then the last one that we've been,
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:50.940]   there we go.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:53.300]   - So this is Sketch and you know that you can do a snapshot.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:54.340]   Isn't that cool?
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.500]   - I love that.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.100]   - Sketch is just, it's just awesome.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.340]   And it's just, and you can very quickly just drag it
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.500]   into whether it's email.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.700]   I drag a lot of stuff into a thing called chatter
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.380]   or on a desktop or email, you know, all of those things.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.900]   It's just really, really easy to annotate.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:11.300]   And then the last one that I wanted to talk about
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.140]   is just Wirecast.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:12.980]   I just want to give people an update.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.940]   Wirecast 4.1 is up.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.340]   It now supports Tarradec.
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:19.460]   - What is Tarradec?
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.100]   - Tarradec looks like a little cigarette car.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.340]   It looks like a little cigarette case
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.820]   that is basically, does a lot of what the LiveU does.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.660]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:27.500]   - It's got a little antenna.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.340]   - It's hardware, yeah.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.180]   - And it's hardware.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.700]   I know I'm doing three, but they're three like quick ones.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.940]   - We are actually streaming on Wirecast right now.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.940]   - Yeah, and Wirecast 4.0 lets you do,
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:39.060]   it lets you see Tarradec's LiveU.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:43.660]   It also lets you bring in, have multi cameras into one card.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.420]   It's a huge upgrade and 4.0.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.380]   It really should have been a 4.0.
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:49.460]   - So I always think of this as a kind of equivalent
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.820]   of the TriCaster which we used to switch.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.660]   - It is in some ways.
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:53.500]   - It's a lot.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.980]   - But it also, and I didn't know this,
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:58.380]   but we use it to, so if you're watching our stream,
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.180]   we're running Wirecast in a big computer downstairs.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:03.500]   It's taking the video from the TriCaster
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.860]   and streaming it out to all these different people.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.700]   - This is actually what I use when I do my own
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.020]   podcast from my house.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.540]   So I don't have all the hardware at my house.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.940]   We have all the hardware here, we use lots of switchers.
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:15.500]   When I switch at the house, I've got four inputs.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.060]   It can also, the thing Wirecast can see
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.300]   is it can see every laptop on my network.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.220]   So I can sit there and jump between different screens.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.100]   - So you can use IP based cameras as well as--
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:25.660]   - Yeah, and what this now lets you do,
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.620]   the new 4.1 lets you do that.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.180]   It is, if you're trying to figure out
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.540]   what you're gonna do for your corporation
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:32.980]   or what you're gonna do for your school,
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.740]   this is definitely one that you wanna check out
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:37.740]   because it's so easy to use.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:39.020]   - And it's Mac and Windows.
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.700]   - Mac and Windows, I think the Mac version
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:41.540]   works a little better.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:46.540]   - $550 for the regular Wirecast 4, $995 for the Wirecast Pro.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:50.420]   - And it is, but remember, how much is your TriCaster?
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.500]   I mean it's-- - Oh yeah, it's one-tenth
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.340]   the cost of a TriCaster.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:55.220]   - Right, and my hardware mix was a lot.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.340]   - One-fortieth the cost of a TriCaster.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.420]   - So the thing is now with the new one,
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.660]   you can have a Mac Pro,
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:02.620]   Matrox makes these cards with four inputs.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.380]   You can hook four or eight cameras into this thing
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.620]   and be editing away.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:09.580]   So it's a really, really--
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:13.220]   - I learned to like it more every single time I use it.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:15.820]   - My pick, if you're buying a new MacBook Air,
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:18.460]   you might say 64 gigs, it doesn't seem enough.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:19.540]   In fact, that's what happened to me.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:22.060]   I bought the MacBook Air in October,
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:25.140]   and I quickly found that because I'm using it now
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.180]   for broadcasting, I wanna put Windows on it,
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.640]   I needed more space.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.340]   I was very happy to say that other world computing
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:34.540]   has a very nice upgrade that's very easy to do.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.180]   The solid-state drives on the MacBook Airs
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.740]   are not like regular drives,
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:39.980]   they're more like memory cards
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:42.900]   with a connector on the short end.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:46.180]   They sell them for the new Air as well as the old Air.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.060]   Look, this isn't cheap, but it's surprisingly affordable
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.860]   for 180 gigs, 379 bucks.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:54.140]   I bought the 240 gigs, it was about 500 bucks,
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.460]   and it's really nice.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:59.980]   It's like having now a ton of storage on my MacBook.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.260]   I'm really happy about it.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:03.180]   How fast does that, how fast did it say that the--
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.460]   Well, they claim it's faster,
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:06.100]   I can't tell if it's any faster,
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.740]   but they claim it's up to 40% faster,
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:13.100]   68% faster for things like capturing video
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.660]   to your disk, things like that.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:16.060]   Then a spinning drive,
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.020]   and they say these are even faster than the Apple stock drives.
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.700]   I don't know if that's the case,
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.540]   but it's certainly no slower, and it sure is nice.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:24.660]   I love solid-state.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.340]   There's something that's gonna be very exciting
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.460]   when Blackmagic or AJA finish their SDI
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:33.340]   to Thunderbolt connection.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.580]   There's something about being able to capture
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.780]   uncompressed 4444 into an air.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.820]   Solid-state is beautiful, baby.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:40.940]   Solid-state.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:44.660]   And now, finally, Andy's pick of the week, Andy and I go.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.380]   Mine is something I've had in the house for a while now.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:51.420]   Elgato is a company that makes that really cool ITV device
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.420]   for doing--
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:56.060]   Love it, turn it back into a DVR tuning live video.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.180]   They recently came, or rather,
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.780]   they recently teamed up with another company
[01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:05.300]   that had this really cool little box called the HD Home Run.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:06.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:09.900]   And the problem with the original ITV was that
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:10.980]   it was USB sticks.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:13.100]   You had to always keep it plugged into a Mac
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.740]   that Mac pretty much always had to be running
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:18.860]   in order for it to have TV available
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.180]   to other machines with the network.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:22.660]   This is its own little Ethernet device.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.300]   So you just plug this into the network,
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.900]   plug this next to your cable box.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.500]   So if you want to split out and get the actual cable TV,
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:31.820]   or you can put it wherever in the house,
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:32.740]   you get the best reception.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:37.260]   So you no longer have to have a Mac next to a cable TV outlet,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.620]   or next to the top of the roof where you can actually
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:41.460]   get over the ear clear signals.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.780]   And then any Mac that you've got that's running the ITV software
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.220]   can find it on the network and use it as a tuner
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.700]   and do all the cool stuff that the ITV software does.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.780]   Like record stuff.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.700]   Excuse me.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:57.740]   It has an access point for the ITV software for your iPhone
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.020]   or your iPad.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.580]   And it's just a really great way to get
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:06.340]   HD TV video on your network and on all your devices.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.900]   There are a bunch of other apps and other hardware
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.900]   boxes like the sling box that are very, very good.
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.820]   I like the sling box for very different reasons.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.380]   But the difference between that and the ITV solution
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:20.580]   is that the currency of ITV is you
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:25.860]   have an MP4 file on your desktop with HD video on it.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:31.260]   So if you want to do some cool but rather boring stuff,
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:34.780]   meaning to access your home network by your iPad
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.500]   and watch this HD video via Wi-Fi, you could do that.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.620]   But you could also have the ITV software on your Mac back home
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.900]   after it makes the recording to please copy that
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.620]   onto your Dropbox account so that in your hotel room,
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.620]   you can simply download it and then sync it
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.660]   and play it as local HD video.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:52.180]   That's cool.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:52.700]   This is so cool.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.620]   The iTunes Store.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.980]   So it just gives you a whole bunch of add and options.
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.420]   And now that it's a network device,
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:00.060]   it doesn't mean that you have only one ITV that's only
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.780]   available for one of your machines in the network.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.060]   It is available to every single machine on your network
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.620]   that's running the ITV software.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.820]   And does this also--
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:09.140]   Go ahead.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.100]   Does it work with Comcast?
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:14.660]   Well, it doesn't have a cable card slot
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:18.220]   so that it will only work with either over the air broadcast
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:22.180]   digital or anything that's coming over your cable connection
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.500]   by Clearquam.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.220]   So the unscramble channels that every cable company's
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.100]   pretty much forced to--
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.740]   Fewer those out there.
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.580]   But yeah.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.700]   Well, but still it'll get to the Letterman Show.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.380]   It'll get you the McPherson Show.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.660]   And you're out of luck if you want
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.940]   to pirate a copy of "King of--
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.220]   of "Entourage" or something like that.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:45.300]   But it's still pretty damn useful in and of itself.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.940]   But also it has two tuners built into it.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.060]   So you can actually be watching--
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.460]   You can actually have one computer downstairs watching TV
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.740]   on this and then another machine upstairs actually
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:57.220]   recording TV.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:00.540]   So it's, as I said, very flexible device
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.140]   for a whole bunch of different users,
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:04.580]   especially if you're someone like me who, if they're not
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.780]   necessarily happy just recording something,
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:09.500]   they also need to make sure--
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:10.820]   just just watching it later.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.940]   They also want to make sure they have it in their libraries
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.580]   so they can watch this TV show pretty much
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.020]   whenever they want.
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.820]   Again, a perfect companion for something like the ITV,
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:22.660]   because you have a tuner there and you can do it all.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.180]   Actually, it would replace--
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.140]   It replaces the ITV.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.340]   It is essentially imagined instead of having--
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.460]   Oh, it has a tuner, of course.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:30.540]   You don't need a tuner.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:31.540]   Exactly.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:35.580]   It has its own cable antenna.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:39.260]   I'm going to just now use the high-tech zoom in features
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.500]   so that they can see that really this is just all you need.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:43.940]   You just plug this into your network.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.540]   And now you have a network TV tuner
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:50.740]   that you can then access via whatever Mac you have on your network
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:52.700]   that has the ITV software built in.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:53.900]   Now, I was a little bit disappointed.
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:57.180]   It would have been really awesome if the ITV software
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:00.420]   for the iPhone and the iPad could simply connect to this
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.220]   remotely and directly in just the tune and live video.
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.460]   That's not the case.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.980]   If you want to use those two iOS apps,
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.220]   you still have to have a Mac that's actually running at the time
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:13.060]   to host the content and act as the conduit.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:17.180]   But other than that, it's a little bit pricey at $179.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.220]   But again, if you're kind of a bit of an archivist,
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.380]   it's kind of worthwhile.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:24.260]   Just last week, I finally got around to hooking up a--
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.140]   I've got one cable box in the house that does not spit out
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.420]   HDMI that spits out old-fashioned analog.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:35.100]   So I finally got around to reorganizing my hardware
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:39.900]   so that I've got now a DVD burner connected up to that device
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.020]   so that when Dina Daimaro was on great performances,
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.460]   I can now not only record that and launch it,
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:47.780]   but also convert that easily to digital video and have it
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:50.340]   in my iTunes library forever and ever.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.740]   I'm looking at this website.
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.540]   SiliconDust is the name of the company, silicondust.com.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.180]   And they do some interesting stuff.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:58.900]   I want to learn more about this.
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.140]   They're in some cool stuff.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:03.820]   They actually make a version, I believe, of the HD Home Run
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.540]   that actually works with cable card.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:10.100]   So under those circumstances, you could lease a decoder card
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:14.420]   from Comcast or from Verizon, possibly plug it into this thing
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:15.900]   and actually have it work that way.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:20.060]   I'm not sure if that model works with Elgato's ITV software.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.380]   The cool thing about when you buy it from Elgato
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:25.380]   is that you get a discount on the package price.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:29.740]   The cost of that box plus the cost of the ITV3 software
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.340]   is cheap as a bundle.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:35.180]   And you really want to use it as with the ITV3
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.100]   because that's what gives you all the really cool secret
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.900]   sauce that makes it all Mac-like.
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:40.500]   I do like that software.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:41.340]   I really do.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.860]   So you don't need the Elgato hardware.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:46.860]   You buy this from Elgato and it has the Elgato software as well.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.420]   That's great.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:47.940]   Yes.
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:49.620]   They'll sell you a package that has this one,
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.260]   which they've apparently licensed from this other company.
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.300]   But they'll give it to you in one box packaged with the ITV3 software.
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.340]   Cool.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:00.100]   HD Home Run, Elgato, e-l-g-a-t-o.com, $180.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.820]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago.
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:05.580]   Sometimes his website, the Celestial Waste of Banwhith,
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:11.860]   he's @ihnattkow on Twitter and joins us every week for Mac
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.380]   Break Weekly.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:13.500]   Thank you for being here, Andy.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.100]   I appreciate it.
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.900]   Alex Lindsey, same thing.
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:21.620]   Pixelcore.com is the multimedia guild, which is just down the hall from here.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.660]   And you moved.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.100]   Sorry.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.660]   There are neighbors.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.300]   Now I want to go over to the studio.
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.300]   I don't think I got the car.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:29.860]   I don't think I just walk around.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.580]   We share the brick house.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.700]   Also, Pixelcore.tv if you want to see the programs.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:38.860]   And every Thursday, now you're doing live shows at pixelcore.com/live.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:39.580]   What's coming up this evening?
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:40.140]   You're a media tech.
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:41.300]   So we're going to talk to Brent again.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:41.800]   Good.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.340]   I think we're actually going to be talking a little bit about the studio.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:46.820]   Brent, OceanStudio.com is the guy who did that SketchUp 3D of our studio.
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:48.580]   But he's also the guy who did all the lights, cameras.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:52.380]   I mean, if you like how the studio looks, Roger Ambrose did the canvas.
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:53.660]   Brent painted it in.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:57.820]   And in the Pixelcore channel, we posted the color discussion we had with Brent last month.
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.340]   Oh, good.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:01.740]   And so if you go to YouTube and search for Pixelcore, you'll see it in the channel.
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:02.340]   I wanted to see that.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.660]   And it is awesome.
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:06.700]   I mean, of course, it starts off with me saying, oh, this is only going to be 40 minutes long.
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:10.020]   And then two hours later, they're like, OK, we better stop.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.180]   Brent is a god.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:13.380]   He just really did a beautiful job here.
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.620]   Speaking of gods, Tanya and Adam Anxt are American gods.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:22.380]   They run tidbits for 21 years now at tidbits.com.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.740]   The best newsletter for people who want to follow Apple.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.740]   And it's absolutely free.
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.300]   It's a really great, great deal.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:35.220]   You guys have made this a must read every single week for me for the last two decades.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.580]   And I encourage everybody else to check it out as well.
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:38.500]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.540]   tidbits.com.
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:40.260]   Well, thanks for being here.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:44.500]   We love having you on all the way from Issaqua, Ithaca.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.260]   It's the same about that.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:50.020]   Yeah, you just start with an eye and go from there.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:50.980]   Thanks, Adam.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:51.900]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:52.580]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:54.580]   And now, thank you for joining us.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:58.740]   But you better get back to work because break time is over.

[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:05.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.040]   (upbeat music)
