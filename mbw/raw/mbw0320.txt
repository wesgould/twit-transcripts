[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.080]   It really depends if there's any Mac stuff.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120]   I will ask a Mac question of our esteemed panel, but I don't know if we'll have a Mac answer.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   Let's start to my left with Mr. Andy Inako, the Chicago Sun Times, and the Celestial.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.760]   Waste of bandwidth.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   Now with more battle like.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   It's a ukulele.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.160]   It's a fluke concert scale ukulele with a composite body.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.320]   And I believe it was a top and yes.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.480]   So not that you're not a great ukulele player, but why do you have such a fancy ukulele?
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.520]   You don't play it, do you?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.040]   Oh, you do.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.680]   Let's, no, let's, this, this is actually the first ukulele I bought, uh, bought from.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.320]   Actually, the first, first editor I had, uh, and got paid for, uh, he was, uh, he's a, uh,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.760]   guitar player, ukulele with player.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   And we were talking about like ukulele's for like six or seven months and said, here,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.920]   here's mine.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760]   I thought maybe your roommate was Jake Schumler.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.000]   Take that, take that to dinner and I'll go borrow something and you just like.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.360]   He just leaves it right around.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.040]   No, you see, if, if my, if my, if he were my roommate, he would pretty much have instituted
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.400]   Andy, you're not allowed to do what you do to the ukulele.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.720]   I love your, you see, to me, and you know, he's a virtuoso, but to me, the ukulele really is for,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.680]   you know, sailors, uh, people, you know, he's just kind of plucking, you know what I'm saying?
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.760]   It's like, uh, it's a little, uh, it's like the horn, like the ukulele.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   It's like the horn pipe or the, that, that squeeze box that they have on the boat.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.240]   It's a, it's a, it's a fun non-threatening non-attimidating instrument that fits nicely
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.520]   like next to your desk as you're waiting for another machine to reboot.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   You can, you can get through two or three chords and master really odd, like, transposition
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   while you're waiting for.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   Okay.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.960]   Exactly.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.160]   I really thought that I could just use this video player, but I guess I need to restart again.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.480]   Yay.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.960]   Isn't this simpler than cable TV?
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.320]   And then you're storming your ukulele.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.480]   It's only your less annoyed by stupid decisions.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.680]   I went next door to our local music chef, told music and I, I bought a ukulele because I love it.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's really, and I said, um, and do you guys have lessons?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.960]   They kind of laughed.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.360]   They said, nobody really takes lessons.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.600]   You just play actually.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   Actually, I'm, you, it's funny you should mention that I believe, I'll, I'll, I'll double check to
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   make sure, but I believe that all during the month of October, every guitar center is doing
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.800]   free ukulele lessons on like Saturday mornings.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.880]   So there's someone like this.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.360]   You're chilling.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   I'm going to guitar center.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.200]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.920]   My God.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.920]   Welcome back.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.080]   Good.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.720]   At least a week.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   Nice shirt.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.800]   Is that really blue or are you green screen today?
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.560]   I, you know, I actually carry around my own, my own green screen.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.840]   I mean, people, you know, you just, every once in a while, you just want to be somewhere else.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.120]   And yeah, you just have a green screen.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   Nice to see you.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.760]   Good travels.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.960]   Good things going well.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.200]   Yes.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   I'm here for a whole nother.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   But you brought a little to show and tell which, you want to make that your pick?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.080]   Because we want to buy one.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.800]   It's not a Mac pick, but, but I thought when you talked about it, I thought you might be going to have a show.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   I need one.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.000]   And we're trying to raise money.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.480]   I'll explain how we're raising money to buy one of those things that you got there.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.400]   Hey, but before we talk about that, let's say hello to Alison Sheridan from Nozilla Cast,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360]   who was out here over the weekend.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   But unfortunately, we do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.240]   So she's back home, right?
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.440]   I am.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.960]   I was excited to be there though.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.000]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.880]   It was great to have you.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.600]   And by the way, it's Nozilla Castly or not Nozilla Cast.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.280]   I know, but I like the nose part.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.920]   So it has nothing to do with noses.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.880]   Or Mozilla. I think that was why everybody says that, but...
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.960]   I just think of noses.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.080]   Anyway, Nozilla.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.160]   But you can't remember Christmas, dude.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.960]   What does it mean?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.080]   It's got a stupid, it's my name spelled backwards.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.760]   Alison backwards is Nozilla.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   I wanted to be able to talk about whatever I wanted to talk about.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.480]   So I picked an obscure website with podfeet.com and an obscure name so that no one would be able to
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.520]   figure out what it was about.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.640]   And you've been doing this for a long time.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.440]   You're actually, you've had more episodes than we have of Mac break weekly.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.640]   Woo. Yeah. Seven and a half years now, I think.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   Holy cow.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.120]   Not as far back as you go personally, but yeah, I still...
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.480]   No, I'm a little older than seven.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.920]   No, I know what you're saying though, but no, you did this.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.760]   You started doing this before we started doing Mac break.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.080]   And so this is a classic.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   Yay.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.840]   And you were out for the Big Mac Expo, which is weird because it's in Petaluma.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   And I never make it because I'm always doing a radio show during it.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.880]   Yeah, it was really cool.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.640]   It's sort of like a super user group kind of thing, but it's kind of intimate,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.000]   but everybody's really into the sessions and lots of great questions.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.720]   And it was great hanging out with my Mac homey.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   So it was really fun.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   I definitely recommend it.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.600]   Oliver Bridenbeck is still here from blank software.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   He never left.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.720]   He just moved in.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.640]   You gotta admit, once you get to Petaluma, you just kind of...
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.120]   You don't want to leave.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.680]   Oh, this is good.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.200]   But you're from Munich, right?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.000]   So Munich's a nice place.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.520]   Although, Oktoberfest is over, which is really frustrating.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.000]   Why don't we get a 10-0 online?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.680]   Do tourists arrive in Oktober,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.360]   for Oktoberfest, and then find out that it's over and get upset?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.160]   Does that ever happen?
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.440]   Like they're looking around, where is it?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.360]   Yeah, it must.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.240]   Because it's in September.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.720]   Did you know that?
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.680]   I have a word for that.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   Research.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.200]   You're going to fly all the way to Germany.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.680]   You might want to try to figure out exactly when it's occurring.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   But they called it Oktoberfest.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520]   Does Oktober mean September in German?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   No.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.000]   Ok, just checking.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.440]   It's just a German joke.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.200]   It's a joke on everybody else.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.120]   It teaches everyone to be more precise.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.200]   You have to have a certain level of intelligence to drink mass quantities of beer.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.680]   Yes, in Germany.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.080]   In Germany.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.480]   In Germany.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.440]   In Germany.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.720]   Here, not that required.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.240]   Ollie has a very odd sense of humor.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.480]   It drove us around quite a bit.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.200]   It's very strange.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.840]   Oh, I love it.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.880]   You call him Ollie?
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.400]   Oh, sorry.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.880]   Oliver?
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.000]   Can I call you Ollie, too?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.800]   Sure.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.120]   Alright.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.520]   And I'll call Alison.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.480]   I'm going to call you Fran.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.280]   And I'll be Kukla.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.080]   And we'll have a show.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.760]   So.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.840]   Sifl?
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.520]   You may.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.000]   Sifl.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And Ollie.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.960]   Sifl.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   And Ollie Schoen.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.040]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's get serious.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.880]   Because it was October 5th, 2011, a year and four days ago that Steve Jobs passed away.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.720]   And a very sad day, I remember on the Twit Network we were doing.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.440]   Triangulation.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.120]   Kevin Marks was being interviewed.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   And as it all often happens, the chat room was the first
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.800]   to say anything.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.440]   And having seen two previous incidents of people declaring Mr. Jobs dead and being wrong,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.160]   two fairly well-known mistakes earlier that year,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   I decided to hold off a little bit.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.960]   We did some research.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.640]   And in fact, sad to say it was as much as we didn't want it to be true.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.040]   And Kevin, who had worked for a long time at Apple, was part of the QuickTime team.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.400]   I think pretty much invented QuickTime.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.800]   Had some memories and we went on.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.160]   It was a really, it was a moving time.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.440]   You were here for that, were you not?
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   So I remember a lot of us went over to Ken Ray had his live show.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   He just dumped it up the live show in the chat.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.240]   And it was sort of like you needed to be with other Apple people to understand how
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.400]   oddly upsetting it was.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.600]   I think that's true.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.320]   I think that's true.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   Sure, it was sad, but it was big sad.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.240]   I didn't expect to be as emotionally affected by it as I was.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.640]   It was as if we all knew him personally.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.440]   Well, I think it was a little like when I didn't have that sort of connection
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.120]   when John Lennon died.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.640]   But you understand that when somebody is writing the soundtrack to so much of the key
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   events of your life or you organize your life's memories according to the work of this other
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.840]   person and so the company, when suddenly that person is no longer, it really does hit home.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.320]   I mean, part of the rug gets pulled out from you a little bit there.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.360]   And all I thought was.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.320]   Even though we stopped coming.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.720]   Oh, it was this was one of the, he had been declared dead for you.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.840]   You know, his surgeon said you're not going to make this five years earlier.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.680]   I mean, the guy really had a lot, a huge life force in state alive a lot longer than his
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.280]   physicians expected.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.120]   But in the end, he did succumb to the pancreatic cancer.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.920]   And, you know, I think a year later is a good time to kind of reflect because at the time,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   it was, you know, it was kind of a mixed bag.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.680]   There were lots of memories, both negative and positive.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:25.040]   But now a year later, I think we can kind of think more clearly about his legacy.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.520]   And boy, it just, it seems like the world is a, the tech world particularly is a less
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.880]   interesting place from last year.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.920]   I definitely agree.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.440]   I mean, I think that you, I mean, Apple is, I think Apple's doing a great job.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.880]   I mean, continuing to move forward.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.600]   I think that stock market disagrees, by the way.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   And I think the stock market has decided that the iPhone 5 is proof that the Steve Jobs
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.200]   Gold Glitter Dust is gone.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.520]   Seriously, I think that's what, that's why the stock is going down.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.480]   It's a blip there.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.000]   They're blips up, they're blips down.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.680]   Go from year to year and that's really the metric that you need to look at.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   I know.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.200]   We're expecting people who, who think they know something about money,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.400]   trying to make, yes, is about technology.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.360]   And they rarely correct.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.440]   They often know a little about either.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.320]   Yes, exactly.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   As it turns out.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.400]   So, so I don't think that's necessary.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.640]   So it is down to $638 this morning.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.000]   I mean, that's down to $638.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.080]   Oh my goodness, they're still the, don't walk on the sidewalk to San Jose
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.920]   because they're Apple employees jumping.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.240]   Well, I got to, I got to point out it was over 700 when the iPhone 5 came out.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.200]   That's what always happens before I'm getting back for a release.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.520]   And yet they're selling absolutely every one of them they can possibly make Alex can't even get one, right?
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.000]   I know.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.720]   I'm still waiting.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   I want one.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.200]   Boy, that's terrible.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.640]   They're doing a horrible job.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.760]   Well, and maybe they are.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.680]   I mean, they should be able to make more of them.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.720]   That's certainly one issue.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.320]   It's an, well, it is an interesting idea that the Apple has this problem time to time and time again.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   And that is the problem you want to have where you can't make them as fast as you're selling them.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.960]   And also where you don't have lots of inventory just hanging around.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.080]   But on the other hand, how much money is Apple leaving on the table?
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.600]   Clearly not much.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.800]   But if there's any one thing that any analyst could complain about Apple,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.880]   it's like, you could be making more money for us, but you're not have the highest.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.240]   That's probably what the market's on line.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.280]   That's probably what the market's saying is, hey, why aren't you making more money for us?
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.000]   That's my response always when they say they shouldn't be able to handle supply.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   I'm just kind of like, yeah, let's try to make 10 million of it's hard.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.600]   It's hard.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400]   And the demand is higher than it was last year.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.120]   Well, not only that and the exacting, the things that we're seeing with
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.040]   at Foxconn and everything else, a lot of it is also, it's not only that they're making 10 million
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.440]   of these, is that they keep on becoming more exacting.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.960]   They keep on becoming, you know, the tolerances keep on tightening on exactly how to make these.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.160]   I mean, they're doing it also saying, we're going to take, we're going to make this object
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.440]   that was really hard to make and we're going to make it even harder to make and then we're
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.160]   going to make more of them.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   You know, that's the issue.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:57.680]   I should also point out that a year ago on the death of C's jobs, Apple stock closed at 370 bucks
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:04.080]   and they've added more than 300 billion dollars in the last year of market value.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.400]   Wow.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.280]   Yeah, they almost doubled.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.240]   Yeah, they almost doubled it.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.960]   The places fall in a part.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.800]   They almost doubled it.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.480]   It's, you know, I think it's ridiculous to even say whether Steve's legacy, I mean,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.600]   look, he's not there anymore.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   I think probably the iPhone 5 is the last thing that he really had a hand in, yes.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.440]   I think that he has a lot of ideas that are probably bouncing around for the next five or
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.880]   10 years. We're going to see stuff that he was thinking about that they were working on.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.560]   Will they have the same, will they come out the same way, you know, who knows?
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.520]   But, but I think that there's, he was talking about something, I think I was looking at an article
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:45.040]   over the weekend about this that he was talking about something like an iPad 30 years ago.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.120]   You know, you know, you know, 20, you know, 25, 30 years ago.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.800]   I, so hey, when the iPad came out before I even had it, when they announced it in January of
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.520]   what is 2010, I said at that time, this is the product Steve wanted to make from day one.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   This is the computer for the rest of us.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.640]   The technology just wasn't there yet.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.200]   So I guarantee that there's other things that they've been talking about at Apple,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.080]   other things that are talking about that are way out there, you know, whether,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.360]   I mean, he's talked about in the past cars and he's talked about.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.680]   I mean, I think that Apple's opportunity right now is if it, if something touches technology and
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   we hate it, this is an opportunity, this is a market opportunity for them because it doesn't
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.160]   work well, like TVs, like cars, like our microwave, like, you know, banks, you know,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   those are the kind of things that, that I think are opportunities for Apple to.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.000]   Mac, Texas says wait till October 25th when the earnings, quarterly earnings come out,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.800]   Apple, he predicts that 750 and possibly he's right. I mean, the earnings of course will be good.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.240]   And what is interesting and Tim Cook was getting a lot of praise early in the iPhone 5 cycle for
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.840]   getting a lot of iPhone 5 sales into the last quarter. He only had a week of that last quarter.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.440]   And by launching it so big in so many countries, having it sell so well in that first week,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   you can say that they did, they put a lot of that value back into that quarter.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.360]   Well, and I think that also you're going to see, I do think we're going to see the iPad mini coming
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.440]   out in this quarter. And so I think that the, the combination of a lot of iPhone, you know,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.400]   iPhone 5 sales as well as iPad minis, which I've actually the more I've done the research and
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.800]   looked at what the rumors are at least, I'm more interested in an iPad mini than I am an iPad at
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.760]   this point. So it's not the price. It's not unusual though for companies that had strong
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:26.880]   founders and leaders to drift a little bit Disney. When Disney died, the story goes that the Disney
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.640]   folks spent many, many years saying what would Walt do and that froze them and was, and they
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.320]   weren't able to grow until Michael Eisner came along and said, you know, through it all out,
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.280]   Ford is another example. This is from an article by Street Authority, an insider monkey. I don't
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.080]   know if this is credible or place or not. They do raise this issue. Ford, when he passed away in
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.240]   47, did find through World War World War II, it helped them and so forth. But by 2005,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   Ford was struggling because they stopped innovating, right? They just, they kind of,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.600]   they didn't innovate as Henry Ford might have. And then, and then they, by the way, got Alan
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.840]   Malawi in there and turned it around.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.880]   But Apple's got the combination of the supply chain from Cook and Johnny I've still there,
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.200]   who was, by all reports doing most of the really, really cool innovations anyway,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.000]   maybe they've got enough to hold that on a lot longer.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.480]   That's the question, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, certainly jobs did not do it by himself.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.000]   He brought a very good team together and that team is for the most part still there.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.680]   I think that there is a challenge when you have,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   I think that, I keep saying that I think that one of the things that Steve Jobs did at Apple
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.240]   is that he created a company at which someone like Steve Jobs could succeed. And so that's why
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.000]   most of the people that you meet who have achieved that sort of high level where they're
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.160]   part of the directorship of the company think like Steve and they work like Steve. It's,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.280]   when you're journalists, you work with a lot of different companies and I don't know of any
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:59.600]   other company that I've talked to so many people with and they seem to speak as though it's one
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.120]   company doing one product line as opposed to you'll hear something from the phone division of one
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.040]   company and then you'll talk to someone from the tablet division who doesn't seem to have ever
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.520]   heard of this product that the same company is working on that just gave me a briefing on this
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.080]   a week ago. So that's why I think one of the things that's going to help out Apple that is
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.680]   helping out Apple is that there's very little of that internal backbiting. They seem to be putting
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   all of their, most of their work into actually producing products as opposed to fighting to see
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.920]   who gets to own the future of Apple. You don't see that the laptop division,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.840]   fighting the desktop division, fighting the iOS division or at least if they're doing it,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.360]   they're doing it in a way that makes for better laptops and better desktops and better,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.040]   better, I think. That's a really good point. And there's a, I think credit to Steve Jobs for that,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:50.480]   that he's, you don't have this Kremlin-esque jockeying for leadership role. Like Microsoft?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.920]   Like Microsoft? Like a lot of companies, he groomed him cook well. It was clear that Tim was the
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.760]   successor. There was a lot of heat from the market on Apple for not having a public succession plan
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.760]   as Steve declined. And obviously they had a private one and they've done a damn good job of
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.240]   implementing it. I think one of the companies ever do that, right? You never hear about somebody
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   actually doing a succession plan. You talk about it, you put it on paper, but you don't teach him
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.800]   how to do it. And he actually taught how to do it.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   Yeah, it's pretty cool. I mean, I think he knew, of course, they had a luxury, in a way they had
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.520]   this luxury, it's kind of a grim luxury of knowing that Steve was not going to be around much longer
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.600]   for at least a year. And he went around telling people what to do.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.240]   He's just doing it.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:41.920]   Yeah. You get back to your Michael Isner comparison, where Jeffery Katzenberg was groomed to be the
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   replacement for For Isner. He's going to be the head of Disney at some point. Isner kind of
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.760]   run and egg done this. And they wound up Katzenberg simply said, okay, guess what? I'm building my
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.200]   own Disney. And part of my job is going to be if Disney is doing an animated cartoon about ants,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.480]   I'm going to have my company do an animated cartoon about ants. It's going to come out a
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.840]   month earlier just to stick it up your nose. And it's no accident that Lord Farquart looks exactly
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   like Eisenberg. No.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.360]   That's by the way, I think that's a little bit of the scuttle. But and at the end of Shrek,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.280]   remember, he's going into the Magic Kingdom and there's all these line, you know,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.840]   Stanchions he has to go through. There's a little bit of that.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:29.440]   Also, supposedly the name of that character is a homonym for a name for someone.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   Rosebud. Here's Allison's pumpkin. How did that is beautiful, Allison?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.240]   I did that by hand.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.320]   I'm impressed. It looks a little bit like a muppet, but that's okay.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.680]   Because we know we know who it is.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.640]   It knows mine to be quite right.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.600]   I love it. Did you actually have that pumpkin? That's so cool.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.800]   Well, not anymore. It'd be kind of nasty. Looking by now, it was from last year.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.760]   Oh, it was last year. They decay fast.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   A little bit. A moldy kind of smell.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.880]   Did you use a Dremel tool?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.520]   No, but I have a Dremel tool.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.560]   Apparently, there's hardcore people in the world who use Dremel tools to cut my kids.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.920]   Love it. It's like a big entertainment.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.280]   Well, you start off with...
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.040]   Oh my gosh, I'm so good at using this here.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.800]   Oh my gosh. Well, it's very refined.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.320]   I'm going to say you could buy a cheap one.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.360]   The pumpkin gets everywhere and into everything.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.280]   I have a Dremel that I only use on pumpkins.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.720]   Don't do it in the living room.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.640]   And cover yourself up.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.560]   So does it fly everywhere when you're in this?
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.440]   Yeah, you get covered with this coating of pumpkin.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.120]   But the Dremel is like 1,000 RPM. The kids love it, though.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   And you can make really defined teeth.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.720]   So maybe outside.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.840]   Oh, yeah, definitely outside.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.440]   No, I do it out in the porch.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.480]   And I do it somewhere where it's going to be easy to like hose it off.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yeah, it's definitely not the cleanest way to do a pumpkin,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.440]   but it does make cool pumpkins.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.480]   I'm just saying.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.760]   Definitely going to do that.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.160]   I really like the way the show stays on plot, Leo.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.520]   I'm glad we have the agenda.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   Oh, no, we're apples and pumpkins are all...
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.720]   You made the pumpkins?
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.680]   We got them to the pumpkins.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.720]   Well, I started it then.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.840]   This is your fault.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.680]   There is a company making... I think these are beautiful,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.800]   modded MacBook Pros with that image that...
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Remember, we never forget that image that we saw last year
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.640]   created by an artist from Hong Kong named Jonathan Mock.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.040]   And they... I guess if you...
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.800]   But there's a very limited edition of these Steve Jobs.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.640]   There's only three Steve Jobs tribute MacBooks from Uncover.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.320]   Let me see.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   One last time I checked, nobody had the auction.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   It just started and nobody had bought it.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.640]   Wow!
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   Those are beautiful though.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.120]   11,000 pounds.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.160]   The bid is up to now.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.560]   Euro.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.240]   Oh, euros.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   That's even worse.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.240]   No, I think it's better.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   It's not that much money.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.520]   Is it better?
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.240]   I think it's better.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.640]   I can't.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.160]   You know better than me.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   That's not much money.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.120]   Isn't that like $20,000?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.680]   How much is that?
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.480]   $1,100?
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.080]   $11,000.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   Oh, $11,000, sorry.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.480]   Okay.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.280]   Let me just...
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   You know, I can just do a little quick Google on this.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.920]   That's above $13,000.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.360]   $13,000.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.920]   Oh, so that euro is not as much.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.520]   You have $14,161.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.680]   Euro is not as much as I thought it was.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.880]   Only $8,900.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.640]   A euro is not what it used to.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.520]   You're right.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.280]   So, wow, that's a lot of money for a $1,500 laptop
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.880]   with a special cover.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.000]   Is any of this going to charity or is it just?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.920]   Just greed.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.960]   Pure and simple.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.040]   I don't know.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.680]   The item is from the Netherlands.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.440]   They probably use a Dremel tool.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.200]   That's for the person who's got everything.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.080]   Once you're there to...
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.880]   Yes.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.040]   Profits from this auction will be split between two causes.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.240]   The charity Get It Done.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.480]   And a fund we set up together with people at Salanap,
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.280]   especially for this auction dedicated to creating iOS apps.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.160]   Interesting.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.520]   I know that's a lot of money, but it would certainly be a one-of-a-kind collector's item.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.040]   Only three of them available.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   And the guy...
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:18.240]   I'm kind of looking forward to the idle trade to sort of like tamp down a little bit,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.600]   because I don't know many people who really, really want to have their faces be
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.120]   on banners and flags years after they die.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.880]   Only Chairman Mao.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.600]   Maybe a thing's different, Ab.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.400]   That'd be okay.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.400]   Alice, can you make an interesting point?
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.840]   You said that jobs will be studied in business schools for a long time,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.120]   but he really is unique.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.200]   I don't know if he could be a template for others.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.440]   Well, but the way the company was run could be, right?
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.160]   To see a company that goes down to what did he say?
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.480]   It was three weeks from bankruptcy to the most valuable company in the world.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.800]   They've got to study that because I was in a class once a long time ago.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.040]   That talked about how it went in the toilet.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.440]   That was a long time ago before it came out of the toilet.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.280]   So I'm just picturing these classes where they're like,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.680]   "How do you capture that? What was it they did?"
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.520]   A lot of the stuff you were talking about,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.200]   the focus on a single product and not having these different infighting groups.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.000]   How was it organized?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.200]   How did that happen?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.280]   Well, and there's a whole culture.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.320]   I mean, anybody who's done had any meetings at Apple ever is an incredible focus
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   that you don't oftentimes see at other companies.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.640]   You know, where there's just...
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.680]   That was...
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   You're getting to meet number one thing.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.080]   No, no.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.760]   Steve Jobs did when he came back as he said.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.120]   We're cutting all these lines in the Walter Isaac's book.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:41.040]   He says he drew a quadrant, two lines, criss-crossed, and made four boxes.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.600]   He says, "This is what we have.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.320]   Consumer, professional, mobile desktop.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   That's four products. That's it."
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.920]   And they cut...
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.720]   I mean, they had this.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.280]   They had a crazy under Scully and then Emilio and...
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.080]   It was confusing.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.880]   I remember trying to buy my parents a Mac in the mid-90s and not...
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.000]   Literally, just not buying one because I couldn't figure out what I wanted.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.560]   It's a lesson.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.640]   Should I have a TV tuner or should I have this?
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.120]   I know.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.320]   But look at Dell.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.840]   Look at Toshiba.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.640]   Look at Lenovo.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.480]   It's a lesson no one else in this industry has learned.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.240]   They're all doing hundreds of SKUs.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.680]   And there's...
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.600]   I mean, there's a difference.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.840]   So there's a way to do that right and there's a way to do that wrong.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.560]   I would put it that Samsung, for instance, does it right?
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.240]   And some of the companies do it right.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.040]   Where there are a lot of companies where their position is,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   whoever it is who's out there looking for product X with money in their hand,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.280]   we are willing to put products X in that person's hand and take their money.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.800]   And so that's why you have handset makers that are making
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.720]   three different lines of phones and each phone in two or three different sizes
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.960]   because they want to cover all of the bases.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.200]   Whereas Apple is, "Nope, we're going to put our...
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.560]   We're going to make very, very smart wagers on one thing.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.360]   And not only are we going to put all of our efforts into that one thing,
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.560]   we're also going to put all of our efforts into explaining to people why this was the right choice."
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.480]   And what consumers really like is someone who clearly is smarter than they are,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.120]   who has thought about this purchase more than they have,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.640]   who's telling them, "Not here is 11 different kinds of this thing.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   Take your pick, but here is the one that you want and it's the one that we sell."
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.320]   So that's what Apple's doing so smart.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.720]   Web 70, 243, and the chatroom makes a good point.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.480]   He says, "There's two different business models.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.640]   One is, Apple's is based on high margins, making a lot from the machine.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.800]   The other is based on high volume, as you described it.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   He's selling as many machines as you can."
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   Now, Apple, Fortune has done an interesting thing,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.680]   which is they've managed to have high margins and high volume together.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   And that's a winning strategy.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.440]   That's the way everybody should build their business.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.880]   [laughter]
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.000]   You know, when you guys were talking about they really ought to be building more of these.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.520]   Wouldn't you love to maybe play those articles to the people working in Foxconn
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.680]   and say, "Yeah, you should be making more of them.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.880]   You're not going fast enough."
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.440]   [laughter]
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.960]   Well, that's kind of what they've done, isn't it?
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   I mean, I imagine the pressure now on Pegatron, Foxconn, these other companies that are
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.920]   the Chinese companies that are manufacturing them, they're told,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.680]   "Make more, make them as fast as you can."
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.920]   And by the way, more precisely than ever before.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.480]   And it sounds like that's what the current upset at Foxconn
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.360]   was all related to.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.360]   It was not the amount of, it wasn't at least what it looks like.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.120]   I mean, we're not there.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   But what some of the reports are is that it wasn't about the number of hours.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.240]   And it wasn't about the hard work.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.280]   And it wasn't about those things.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   What it was about was the quality control employees who have to pay attention to it.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.840]   And the tolerances were tightened.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.880]   And when they tighten those tolerances, it means that they send more back,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.680]   which makes the workers that are building them more upset.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.440]   And creates this huge amount of friction.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.040]   So it wasn't the amount of work.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.800]   It was the fact that the tolerances had tightened,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.440]   which means that it created more conflict internally,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.600]   which then generated a strike.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.760]   You know, because they're just really upset that they have to deal with.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.600]   Because then they have to deal with conflict every day,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.280]   rather than getting them out the door.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.920]   And so it sounds like they're not only trying to make more,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.520]   but they're also tightening all these tolerances down to a level that is,
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.920]   you know, you definitely, you have to admit that,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.480]   you know, you can decide that a lot of these other phones are better for this reason or another.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.600]   But the one that is the most consistent quality still, in my opinion,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.160]   of the ones that I pick up are is definitely, you know, the iPhone.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.600]   Well, this one, especially now, it's like a fine Swiss watch,
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.000]   which by the way, I dropped and dinged badly.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   But see?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.520]   See?
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.160]   Wow.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.080]   Yeah, there's a big divot out of it now.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.040]   I heard about that on Twitter.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.120]   And I was like, it looks like I was very curious.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.600]   It looks like it was made out of pewter or lead.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.960]   And it just like scooped a little scoop out of it.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   And then at the other side, there's where it.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.480]   So I think, you know, I don't even remember dropping it,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.160]   but I think what it did is it hit there,
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.520]   it bounced and then it hit there, because at the other end, you'll see more divots.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.760]   I got a chip in mine and never dropped it at all.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   And, you know, Andy, when you were talking about it,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   what I got, that chip.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.000]   That little tiny, shiny spot right there.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.640]   Yeah, I see it.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.360]   That's what I got.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.120]   And I didn't drop it.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.080]   I didn't set anything on it.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.440]   Well, I don't remember dropping it.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.840]   You too, Andy?
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.080]   No, no, I'm carrying mine without a case for like more than a week.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.280]   And it's perfect.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.080]   And now watch me drop it on the towel floor as I'm really trying to show up.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.960]   He's so proud.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.440]   He's broken it is.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.840]   He's headed for a whole week, and it's not dinged yet.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.240]   Wow.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.320]   I don't think I've seen of all the iPhone rollouts.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.360]   I'm not sure I've seen so many like non issues trying to become inflated into
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.040]   huge, huge problems.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.360]   Like because we saw the scratching quote issue,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.400]   unquote, which to me just says that we went from a device that's made out of
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.680]   stainless steel and aircraft glass, the two most difficult commercial products,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.320]   materials to scratch to something that is made of the same,
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   much the same stuff that's made of everything else.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.640]   Maybe it is going to scratch.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.080]   If this we just were just used to like that never happening on an iPhone.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.440]   And then the issue with the lens flare, where people are complaining,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.840]   or excuse me, I shouldn't denigrate with other people think are is acceptable and
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.240]   acceptable.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.200]   But as soon as I was, I found out that, oh, people complained,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.520]   there's an issue about the lens will flare.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.920]   And every time I had these big, big lights, I was trying to make these lens flare happens.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.320]   And yeah, you could make the purple shaded,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.680]   the purple colored lens flare certainly happened on the iPhone 5 and it would not
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.160]   happen on other iPhones or other phones.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.880]   But I had to come down to, but it's still a ruined shot of all three of these sample shots.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.360]   There are three unusable ruined shots.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.320]   It looks like crap anyway.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah, I mean, and again, maybe some people just simply have a higher tolerance.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   Well, yeah, there was a flare in the in the HTC version of that.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.360]   There's a flare in the iPhone 4S version, but it's not as I could simply accept it and move on,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   whereas this purple just ruins the whole thing.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.320]   I mean, if we're if we're not, this is this is how this is the grave that Apple has dug for itself.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.800]   They are standards are so high and their reputation is so good.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.440]   They now need to make a phone that will never ever scratch no matter what you do with it too.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.520]   I can make great take great pictures when you're pointing the lens directly into the sun.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.920]   Now look really more.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   I would like we would like your camera.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   I would like your camera to defy the law of physics.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.440]   Yes.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.120]   Alex, when you were talking about the workers in Foxconn and the and the accuracy that they're
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   having to hit, one of the things I thought was interesting in the laptop mag was it laptop mag
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.320]   website was that they said that one of the problems was they have these expectations of quality,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.360]   but they haven't told them how to create that level of quality.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.840]   And that's kind of back on, you know, on the company.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.440]   It's not the workers or sloppy.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.520]   If you haven't taught them, here is how you do it in order to get to this exacting quality,
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.120]   then, you know, you're in it.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.240]   I think that the other thing is that it's we're not talking about the workers being sloppy.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.560]   We're talking about incra in tolerances of hundreds of thousands of inches.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.520]   I mean, you know, like I've just incra insane tolerances that they have to mean.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.440]   You have to process is that allow that to happen.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.920]   You don't just, you know, work harder.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   Well, I think it's just trying to figure it out too.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.920]   You know, I mean, like, I think that part of it is like, let's see which ones are working
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.120]   and figure out how they're doing that because I know, you know, I think that it's a very,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.960]   very, you know, difficult, difficult process.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.680]   There's a line in the reviewers guide for the iPhone 5 that I really wanted to quote,
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.960]   but you don't like to quote things directly from the reviewers guide that the company gives you.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.480]   But really, if it's true, it certainly is very impressive where they describe the
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.840]   manufacturing process where you have high speed 20 megapixel cameras that during these
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.400]   automated assembly process are constantly evaluating.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:28.320]   Here is the minute variations in the sizes of these of the iPhone 5 frames, comparing it to
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.720]   this glass screen that has the closest matching tolerance to that.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.640]   So obviously that you can't get with you can't get the same part within like, you know,
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.920]   one millionth of an inch.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.800]   There's going to be some variation, but you have cameras that are trying to figure out,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.880]   well, this one is a little bit too wide on this axis, but here's a case that's also a little too
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.960]   wide by almost exactly the same amount.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.000]   Great. We'll put these two together and we'll still get a perfect fit.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.080]   That is an unusual level of obsession on build quality.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.560]   We're going to take a break. There's one more Steve Jobs story. We'll talk about it in just a
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.680]   second. Why Apple patents everything, but and it's an interesting story.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.160]   Very interesting.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.600]   One more anecdote, but before we do that, let's talk a little bit about Ford.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.440]   We were talking about it earlier, the big turnaround, of course, under Alan Malali.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.560]   What a job he's done making Ford going, going from a company that was struggling to a company
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.640]   that is just firing on all eight cylinders. I say eight because I drive a 20 to a must have
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:30.400]   a 5.0 with eight cylinders, but they have a great insight for people who, like me, like to brag
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:36.080]   about their fords, it's called social.ford.com. It's where we, Florida owners go to hang out.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.200]   So also a great place to live. I just was reading this article. I love this. Do you have
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:48.240]   ET for EV, ET etiquette for electric vehicles? We haven't had enough of them to worry about it,
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.800]   but I love this. Never unplug somebody else's electric vehicle until your shorts charged.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:00.080]   If you don't need charging, don't take a charging spot, because now at the
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.320]   airport, the Oakland airport front row parking right there at the terminal, they've got like
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.520]   eight charging stations.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.800]   I have seen that and thought I really need an EV car just so that I can start there.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   Just here's one. If you charge your EV at someone's house, you pull up and say, "Hey, can I just
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.520]   plug in for a bit?" Offer them some cash for the fuel, throw them some change. How did you know?
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.280]   Exactly. Is that what they said? Yeah. See, they said the public left you.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.880]   Here's exactly. Here's a dime. Thanks for the charge.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.520]   It's a fun site where you can read articles. I have an article on there actually. I was talking
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:41.040]   with one of Ford's lead technologists about the API and app link, all the geeky stuff,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.240]   autonomous vehicles. Oh, here's an interview with Carol Shelby. He's got a new Shelby designed
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   Mustang that is so, so sweet. Actually, I think it's a GT, not a Mustang.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.200]   I can't wait until they have a Mustang like that that's electric.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:02.320]   It is in the works because when I talked, I think it was, I talked to Alan. He said,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.160]   "The whole idea, the reason we were a little slower than others, we didn't get electric car out
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.040]   until this year, is because what we essentially wanted to do is design it so that all of our
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:20.320]   lines for all of our vehicles can be interchangeable drivetrains, gas, diesel, electric, hybrid electric.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   So eventually you can just choose.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.840]   And so, because it's actually smart planning, and this is why Ford is now a viable company,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.400]   because it's based on demand. Well, if people, oh, people want electric Mustangs, no problem,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.680]   you flip the switch and now you're just dropping in that engine. It's really, these guys are,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:45.760]   and the other thing is because Ford, unlike a lot of companies is international,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.920]   and they have manufacturer plants all over the world. It's another thing entirely. They used to
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.000]   have a US design and an Indian design and a Britain design. Now they've figured out ways to make
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.440]   their vehicles, the 2012 focus is a great example. It's an international vehicles.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.120]   One body design with some frills that they change around the world, but basically the
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.200]   efficiency that they're creating is huge. This is a company where you really could study them in
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.760]   business school. Similar turnaround in the last 10 years, amazing. Go to social.ford.com.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.240]   You could celebrate your Ford vehicle, learn about others, Ford vehicles. If you don't have a Ford
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:28.160]   vehicle, you can dream. There's an ideas suggestion box that I love with lots of great ideas,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.440]   you know, Ford to Ford Wi-Fi. So like, if you're driving on a road, you share your music with
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.240]   the other Ford next to it. Would that be a distraction? No, I don't think it's...
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.640]   It's a vicious song. And how do you signal them? You drive up and you like, you like, raise your
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.920]   eyebrows. Like, hey, I got a song for you. Actually, one of the things that I talked about with
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.640]   Buchkowski with and is in my interview is the idea of the car being aware of road conditions. So if
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.680]   the traffic's bad or it's bad weather, it kind of limits the kinds of things you can do. You know,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.440]   it simplifies your focus so that you're much less likely to get into trouble. It's just some
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.120]   really interesting ideas. So those are in the ideas section. Grab a badge. Of course, they've got
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:14.560]   badges for all different Ford owners. And there's one for you, the tech geek badge. You're not just
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.080]   ahead of the curve. You're the one that you have. I actually rented a Ford when I was in
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   Hawaiian vacation. Yeah. I'm a hardcore Honda Acura fan. I've had Hondas and Acura since 1978.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.640]   And I got to tell you, I got in the car and I said, okay, let's see how this Ford sync thing is.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.960]   Leo's always yapping about. And I took out my phone and I said, and it said, oh, you want to hook up
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.000]   with Bluetooth? There's your phones. Isn't that nice? All your contacts? Yeah. Done. I mean,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.320]   that's about 14 minutes in my Acura. Yeah. And it usually fails and I have to start over. It worked
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.200]   flawlessly on both phones. It was fantastic. Similar story here on social.for.com.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.120]   People who traded in their 2000 mile blue tech Mercedes for a Ford edge because of the sync.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.280]   He says, my husband usually wants a different car every six months, but he loves his edge. We
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:05.440]   drive it every day back and forth from Washington to Arizona. That's a long trip. That's a long trip.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.240]   And that's where sync really is great to be able to do. I get into my book, my audiobook starts and
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.280]   continues. I mean, I just love it. Social.for.com to find out more. We thank them for their support
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:25.360]   of Mac Break Weekly. So I don't know. This is an interesting story. And so it goes back to 2006.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:34.960]   Apple was sued by creative technology because they had a patent on portable music playback devices.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.120]   Creative, I think, owned the, did they own the diamond Rio? I can't remember. I think they
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.880]   were the one who bought the diamonds. That went so well for them. Well, the Rio was the first. So in
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.000]   a way, you know, you could say, Hey, we predated the iPod. Clearly it's my first mp3 player. We didn't
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.560]   do it very well, but we did it first. Also, they remember they had to fight all those legal actions
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.480]   from the recording industry saying that that device was illegal and try to get a ban from sale.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.080]   That's right. We do owe them a certain debt of gratitude. So, and this is actually part of a
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:12.000]   larger, highly recommended article in New York Times about the broken patent system.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.960]   But what the consequence of this lawsuit against Apple, I'm not sure how it went. I think Apple did
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:24.240]   not lose it. But Steve at that point said, All right, if that's how they want to play it,
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.000]   we are going to patent everything. We are just not, you know, we are going to patent everything.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.760]   This is, that's the game. Then, okay, we got lawyers.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:41.680]   Apple's, Apple's number of patent applications submitted by Apple each year has risen since then
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:48.720]   tenfold. It received 4,100 patents total since two. Well, it sounds like they just basically
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.120]   have the engineers come in and talk to the lawyers and the lawyers go, okay. Yeah, I think we've
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.600]   been. Apple engineers were summoned to monthly invention disclosure sessions,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.600]   where the engineers would tell the lawyers. And the lawyer said whether it could be patented or not.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.200]   And the one, according to one former Apple lawyer, even when they knew the idea couldn't be patented,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.480]   they applied anyway. Why not? It's broken. It could happen. Some ideas can be patented. Other
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:18.560]   ideas can be possibly patented. Now, here's, here's the point, because there have been some,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.920]   including a recent government study that said we should just abolish patents. All patents,
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.240]   because it's a broken system, not just software patents. One former Apple executive said, hey,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.520]   if we can't patent our intellectual property, we should not spend the money to create things
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.240]   like the iPhone. He explained features like slide to unlock took years to perfect.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.200]   Lots of money going into it. And if companies can steal it, then it's not worth it.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.920]   Remember in 2007, when Steve introduced the iPhone, there's a clip somewhere of this.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.640]   I'll say maybe you could fight where he shows the iPhone. He says we patent. Yes. Boy, have we
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.120]   patented it. Yeah. I mean, that was a public declaration. Stay away from this, boys.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.080]   Yeah. So that's what kind of an, there's an element to it was so, it was so hard for me to
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.640]   pick a specific side in the patent battles that Apple's been fighting with other companies,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.160]   because on the one side, they're definitely fighting the fight of the angels, because
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:24.800]   you cannot doubt that Samsung was copying the iPhone for the first couple of generations of
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.680]   the Samsung Galaxy of the handsets. That's just not subject to debate.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:37.120]   But on the other hand, to say that they're just defending things that they have invented,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.000]   things that would not exist on this planet, had it not for them to go out into the wilderness and
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.600]   bring back the lion pelts at great cost their own lives. No, because I would have been a lot
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.040]   happier with Apple's stance if they had simply, instead of simply said, we are fighting the fight
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   of the just, we're fighting good fights. Everything we do regarding our intellectual property is a
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.840]   good just fight for the right. If they simply said, this is the world that we live in. If you
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.280]   do not, if you are the one person in a gunfight without a gun, you die. This is why we have a gun.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.640]   And I don't think anybody would have really faulted for them for that.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.800]   But if they're going to, if any company that's going to say that we invent everything that we use,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:25.360]   oh boy, that's a long, long investigation into every single product that they make to say that,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.400]   no, how about this thing that was on this other product earlier? How about this thing that was
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.240]   on this other product earlier? So,
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.560]   HB left in our chat room is pointing out the creative $100 million in that lawsuit.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.600]   That's right. I forgot that they did. And that's a mark.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.680]   That's what bit Steve in the cut. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the Steve Jobs quote.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:52.160]   And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch, which is phenomenal. It works like magic.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:43:00.400]   You don't need a stylus. It's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:08.000]   It ignores unintended touches. It's super smart. You can do multi-finger gestures on it.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.320]   And boy, have we patented it. It's even on the slide patented. Yeah.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:21.040]   By the way, they did not invent multi-touch. Yeah. Yeah. When he said that, I remember watching that
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.680]   point. Did you just go through that? Right. Actually, it was a car. The first time I saw it was a
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.040]   TED talk by a Carnegie Mellon scientist well before the iPhone came out. So, I was, I was,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.720]   I spent some time trying to figure out whether or not they had actually licensed that technology.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.400]   I was not able to find evidence of that, but I didn't, I didn't draw any conclusions about
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.080]   whatever from it. My memory, which is always imperfect, as you all know, is that it was not patentable.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.520]   That there was enough prior art in general to multi-touch that no one could claim it.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.000]   But he said he patented it anyway, and he didn't? Well, they, I'm sure they did. What they
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.600]   probably patented is things like their implementation of it, ignoring touches, you know, various, I
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:04.560]   mean, you know, that's the, like, how did it? There was, there was a great, there was a great
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.960]   article on the Verge that all that a couple months ago that further pointed out how silly
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:15.520]   a lot of software patents are, where, for instance, to, to, to point a multi-touch pinch to zoom,
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.840]   for instance, which is often erroneously cited as this is something that Apple has patented,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:26.240]   and they're going to go after anybody who has it. On this, on a surface basis, it might look like
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.680]   these, like two different devices are both using the same pinch to pinch to zoom,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.360]   but they're, they're explaining that their, their legal experts explaining that the way that
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.760]   Android Francis does it, they do it in such a way so that if you, for instance, introduce a third
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:46.400]   finger or if you do like a real, they've introduced a really weird and subtle and completely,
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.840]   trivially easy to miss modification of it that renders this thing as a unique expression of
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.400]   multi-touch, as opposed to a copy of simple pinch to zoom, which I think anybody would agree,
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.720]   is just like trying to patent double clicking. Right. So it just, it just goes to show that if
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.160]   you've got enough money, if you got enough horsepower, if you got enough cannon power,
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.000]   you can get around pretty much any patent that you think that your, your product is going to,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.880]   is, is going to violate. And if you do have more firepower than the person that you think is a
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.640]   threat to you, that threat to you is kind of not a threat to you anymore. It's a toast.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.160]   Well, unless you're, unless you're Samsung, I mean, it's,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.280]   all right, it's turned out that, well, you can bet Samsung's doing the same.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.080]   Well, yeah, they're, why didn't Samsung make any kind of an effort though to make things at
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.440]   least look slightly different? I mean, the thing that makes me crazy is when I look at a Galaxy S3
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:39.120]   and the telephone is, is a white phone and an angle on a green square. You know, copy everything
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   else, but you couldn't even make that look different. Why? Like, it couldn't even be this way instead
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.880]   of that way or on a blue background or the flower for the, for the photos. You know,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:53.280]   why didn't they make any effort at all? Well, I, I, I think that the part of the argument kind
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.640]   of falls apart when you say, well, you're not allowed to have a daisy. You know, it looks completely
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.360]   different from the, the daisy icon on the photos app, but you're not, we own daisies. I say, well,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.920]   if we're going to, we're going to talk about like rip-offs in the Galaxy three, just hold down
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.720]   the home button on the, on the Galaxy three and see what happens. You see something that looks like
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.480]   Siri with a, with a slight, like a mall, a mall cosmetic store makeover.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.400]   This is exactly the same way. It's like, oh, Samsung, you're making it so hard for me to defend you
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.920]   in any way, just knock it off and make a great product. Well, they do now. They do now. I think
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.000]   it was in the early days, right? I mean, now, now there's clear distinction between the Galaxy
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.280]   note and the iPhone five. Well, yes, three. Does it look much different in the interface?
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.800]   No, the, the, I think the interface is unique. There, there are some discrete elements that are,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.880]   again, like Siri, which are clear knockoffs. I'm not going to complain about you.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.400]   How, how innovative you have to be to communicate here is a phone icon for, for this thing,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.320]   but the shape is different. But when you compare it to like the original Galaxy,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.640]   and I have one in my, in my library, in my office, you put them next to each other and, oh man,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.880]   outside of the, the Samsung logo in the face of it, you could easily mistake one for the other. It's
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.760]   hard to, it's hard not to make the argument that they were trying to confuse people into thinking
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:15.200]   that their product was actually an iPhone, but the Galaxy, but it's, I don't think I can point to
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:22.000]   any Android phones being made by a major manufacturer in 2012 that could be confused with an iPhone,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.720]   or which make me think that this company is trying to create a knockoff of the iPhone.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:33.040]   I think, I hope we're at the end of these patent wars, but boy, we do have to fix the system.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.880]   It's such a sucky system. Well, I think that we're going to, this is going to continue until
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.040]   the laws are changed. I think that that's inevitable until, until things are changed. I don't think
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.960]   there's any way to avoid it because I think that it's terrible. I think there's a certain level of
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:51.360]   self-defense. There's a certain level of, um, all, all, all I'm, I'm offended by when it's being used,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.760]   like as an aggressive weapon. I know that this is, I know that this could never happen, but
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.960]   it would be great if it were even remotely possible for two makers to say, for a maker to say,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   here's our new phone. We believe that we don't, we didn't try to rip off your patents, but doing a
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:11.040]   patent search here are some broad things that, you know, that our device could be said to copy yours.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.360]   We've looked at your device and we have patents that seem to cover, let's just put poker chips in
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.360]   front of each other and keep swapping chips. Maybe your stack will be a little bit higher than ours
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.560]   than at the end of this discussion, but we'll figure out how much per unit that we need to
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:29.120]   give each other to release this product without having to say that we have to pull this off the
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:35.520]   market because unfortunately there is an LED that actually commute, actually has color in it.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:42.080]   And unfortunately, because Hitachi patented the idea of communicating the charge state of a device
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:48.080]   via a colored LED with his band from eight cotton, from, from eight countries, like we,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.920]   what, that's just Bush league, man. That's not, that's not what a great company does.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:58.160]   Right. I think that the, um, you know, Apple's complaint is not with Samsung. It's, it's with Google.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.840]   So, so Apple, you know, I think it's made it clear that they're going to use every
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.960]   opportunity they can to pound any Android developer that they, that they can. And we thought that
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.440]   might be a lot easier to sue Samsung than it was to sue. They're more exposed. They copy everything.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   Right. You know, I don't, I don't think it's necessarily true that they were going to pound
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.520]   any Android developer. I do think that they have, and I think that they do have sort of those,
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.920]   that a series of barricades that a company has to go through before they wind up in court and
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.760]   wind up seeking an injunction. So I think that if Apple really wanted to shut down Android,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   they could do it a lot more effectively if they were being a lot more aggressive than
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.160]   they're being right now, which is not to say that I think that everything that they're doing,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.280]   their legal team is doing is, is hunky Dory, but it's, it serves, it serves to reason that they're
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.880]   not necessarily being patent bullies. They're not being patent trolls. Well, I think that they're,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.920]   I think that they're making an example of Samsung because it was the most exposed,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.760]   but they aren't, I definitely think they're changing the entire path of Android development.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.640]   I think that they're, you know, they're, they're making sure that everyone has to think about this.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.120]   So instead of just having to think about producing a great product, everybody has to think about
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.880]   how long will this end up in court, you know, and, and how close are we getting to what,
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.520]   what Apple's doing? And I think that Apple, you know, by, by, by showing that they're not going to,
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.360]   to back down, by showing that they're going to push on this, it makes everybody have to do that
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:19.200]   extra level of, of work, which, you know, gives Apple a, you know, I think a competitive advantage,
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.960]   which is why I think they're going to continue to do it. I don't know.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:29.600]   Would you stay at Apple if they offered you $2 million a month, half a million dollars a week,
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.640]   $100,000 a day? Would you stay at Apple? Oh, yes.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.000]   You know, I'd love to say I, my, my requirement wouldn't be nearly that rich.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.680]   Remember the Bob Nancefield effect. We did a whole bit on it was retiring.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:48.480]   Bob is the guy who was responsible for, you know, production. He was that blue collar guy
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.760]   ahead of hardware engineering, retiring after 13 years with the company.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.440]   In August, the company announced, Mansfield was stayed to work on future products and now
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:05.120]   will be reporting directly to the CEO. Well, it turns out, according to Bloomberg Business Week,
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:12.880]   Bloomberg Business Week, that my head, every time I know, I know I've ruined it for you, haven't I?
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:19.600]   Bloomberg Business Week that in order to keep Bob Mansfield working for Apple, they offered him
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:26.320]   $2 million, not a year, a month. That's NBA money.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:26.960]   How is he in the state to get that?
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.760]   Ah, that's a good question. And I don't even know how they found out this.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.640]   Three months, I got $6 million. I'm out of here. Can you do that?
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.040]   I would imagine it's a longer contract than that.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.720]   And also, I don't know, where they paying him like $2 an hour above minimum wage before
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:48.880]   the software. I'm wondering what we're not hearing about this offer. What was it that made him want
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:55.520]   to not continue if he wanted to leave Apple at that point? And if it were really the raise that
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.040]   actually made him stay, because there's something, there's something, look at this smile.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.840]   Look at this smile. That's a happy man.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:10.480]   This is what it's like a Drew. I love one of the reasons why I love Drew Carey is that he's very
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.960]   upfront about some of the reasons why he does things. And he puts the reason why he took the
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.080]   job of the price is right is because he wanted to buy part ownership in an LA soccer team.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:25.040]   This is your soccer team money. That's soccer team money is right.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.320]   And so there's an interview with him like I listened to last week of the week before,
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:34.160]   was talking about the possibility of him returning to a prime time, like a sitcom series. He said,
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.520]   if I can get ownership, if I could get money for an FA Cup team, then yes, I would do it.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:46.080]   So unless unless this guy wants to wants to wants that part ownership of like an AL
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.400]   American League baseball team, you could buy Arsenal. Are you kidding? This guy's got money now.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.760]   I don't know. That's serious money.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:58.320]   There's something profoundly bent about a guy who might are who already has millions and millions
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:04.160]   of millions of dollars who could be swayed by, you know, by getting 20 million dollars instead of
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:09.440]   15 or 10 million dollars a year. So I think I when I read that story, I'm like, I wonder what
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.400]   else there was. What else is going on in his life? What his goals and priorities are.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.800]   Well, I think also they said it's valued. It's not too many dollars in cash. It was cash in stock.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.320]   And so we don't know what kind of cross section that is and how much stock they're getting and
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.280]   how much you know, we have calculations. Apple stock. Geez. I mean, better than cash. Better than cash.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:32.320]   I tell you what, I wanted to buy my own M co-station. And now I got it. Double A MCO.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.360]   I was thinking of investing in gold for security.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:42.080]   Just lovely, lovely, man. Leo. I don't know. He's all from all from the effort. He's a lovely,
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.960]   lovely, but it's like, it's like, you kind of like as Archie Bunker every six
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:52.320]   whole time. I don't know why he's just blue collar Bob. That's just he's he's there's something
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.360]   about him. I love him. No, no, this is done with love. I am not mocking him. I am saying how much
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   I like this guy in the land where nobody has colors. And everybody's wearing black jeans.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.840]   This is a guy. This is it is a real guy. It's a real man here. This is a guy who knows how to
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.640]   fix stuff. And that's exactly why they could not let him go. Yeah. Yeah, I think that is the issue.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.320]   He said, you know, well, you have trouble with a heat. Let me just get my wrench here. I just
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.040]   bang on that pipe and it's all fixed. They don't let this guy go. In fact, so now he's Schneider.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.920]   He's got the key chain.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:36.480]   In a more in a more positive way, we get your suggesting that in election pollsters would
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.360]   rate him highly as the Apple senior executive that people would most like to have a beer with.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   Well, it's ain't no Chablis drinker here. This year, this is a guy. This is a guy who drinks slits.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.800]   I mean, this is a real man. I love Bob Mansfield. I would like to sit down right now.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.600]   And I would like to Bob right here. I think we have to have an open invitation to Bob.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.320]   Bob, anytime you want to come on the show, I can't offer you a hundred thousand dollars a day.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:06.720]   But we'd love to see you. I'll buy you a beer. So does, yeah. So does Bob's like assistant like
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.600]   talk like he just bunker. Bob, it's a tipcock again.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:21.040]   He's going to come on and go. Hey, I know he probably doesn't talk like that. Actually,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.560]   we know any talks like because there's videos of him. I just haven't paid any attention to him.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:32.240]   I've created in my mind something completely, lovely, lovely man. I love Bob Mansfield. You know what?
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.480]   I remember when we were doing the screensavers and we got a new program director at Tech TV.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.080]   And he pulled me in. I was actually kind of insulted by this. He said, now Leo, you know,
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:45.440]   you're the intellectual and Patrick Norton. He's for the lunch box set. And I said, what?
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.400]   He's for the lunch box set. He appeals to the lunch box set. And this is Bob Mansfield is for
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:59.680]   the lunch box set. Look at him. I bet you he has a thermos filled with black coffee. And he's got
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.640]   a ham sandwich on white bread. There's times the show where I'm glad that I'm off on a little
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:13.360]   screen to the right. I'm saying with absolute affection. I'm thrilled that he stuck around.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.200]   I'm not really your place. I'm just saying I'm glad that here I am in my little box.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.960]   But I think it won it. There he is. Let's hear him. Let's hear him. We knew we wanted to bring.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:28.080]   What LTE does is it enables really fast. Wow, he sounds like a professional announcer.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:35.600]   You'll notice a big difference compared to previous network connectivity. In fact, LTE can
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.920]   actually be faster than the average. Well, I'll take it all back. This guy's clearly
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   Harvard educated designing LTE into a university of Texas uses two chips. All right.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.640]   All right. Both voice and data technology are combined onto a single chip.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.440]   I don't care. I love the man. Even if he talks like a normal human, not cliff-claving.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:00.480]   We're also introduced. Okay, that's enough. That's enough. That's a good he's a good looking
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.400]   fellow though. He looks a little like curly. So he's looking at that kind of money. He's like,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.680]   you know, here's my here's my rotation of Leo LaPorte like,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   God, I keep digging and digging. I can't get any lower. Let me put some more dirt in there.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.640]   Okay. Let's go back out. I got to dig myself into a deeper and deeper hole. There you go.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:25.600]   I just broke through the okay. Now we're keep on digging. How does you know this foot tastes
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:32.480]   awfully good? That's not my foot. I have chat under the table. So in case I want to ever want to
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.440]   do that gag. It's incredible. I'm not that flexible. I did unplug myself. However,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.560]   how all the air is going to go out of it more and more ways than one.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:49.760]   Why is it Leo doesn't get invited to Apple events? No, that's not why. That's not why. They
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.280]   wouldn't fight me if they thought I wanted to go. They like me. Sure. They used to really like
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.000]   me. I used to be I used to really be in good terms with them. I don't know what happened.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.080]   But this is I say again, I'm not saying this in a negative. I look like Bob. If I didn't have any
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:11.760]   hair, Bob Mansfield. Well, I think that the one thing that the whole Bob Mansfield, whatever it
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.840]   actually is, what it shows you though is that just in case you thought that Steve Jobs was the
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.120]   only one that was making everything work, evidently there are people at Apple that disagree.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.760]   You know, because they decided that that was one of the people that.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:27.120]   Furthermore, I mean, the story is that the people who did that they brought in another guy, I won't
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.800]   say that guy's name, but that nobody wanted that they said, no, bring back Bob. We love Bob.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:36.480]   So the employees demanded it. They said, we can't go on without Bob.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.640]   There was insurrection. There was an insurrection. And I think you can thank Bob for this.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.040]   Apple has now started shipping its 30-bit adapter. Thank God.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.400]   My doorbell just rang it. That's what it was. Go see it. Go see.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.040]   Joe, go check. Do you want to? Yeah. Something just got delivered.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.320]   The first wave of new lightning to 30-pin adapters are now shipping.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:01.120]   Several readers in Australia told Mac rumors their orders are in transit.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   And one said October 9th delivery. That's today.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   Ooh, let's see if Allison got her 30-pin connector because I need a bunch of...
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.840]   The first wave of 30-pin connectors just in time for the fourth wave of complaints about
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.160]   how to spend $30 to make a bigger dock work again.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:26.160]   Well, at this point, I'll pay anything. I already spent almost $200 on adapters for the 9-pin.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:32.320]   I think people will forget about the complaints after one month after the visa bill arrives.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.560]   I think they'll forget about the... You know what's really funny?
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.800]   Now I'm kind of mad that I have to use a 30-pin adapter for my iPad.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.080]   It's flipped completely around. Was it Allison?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.880]   Clearly it was far too valuable to actually leave there.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.600]   Oh, I hate that. I hate that.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.520]   There is one UPS driver that hates me because I get... I order so much stuff from Amazon
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.640]   and all of it just gets... They drop off all kinds of stuff in front of my house.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.240]   You've got to make friends with them. And then there's the one tip on a busy street.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.200]   And they're trying to pretend that there's so much stuff that they leave out there.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.160]   And there's plenty of people at the house and it's just that the doorbell doesn't work.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.880]   And anyway, that happened to me yesterday.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.520]   Second notice. I hate second notice because that means if I miss it the third time, it goes back.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.480]   And I ordered four more Sonos speakers so I can have music in my entire house.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.080]   So it's so fresh because I was downstairs. I just didn't hear them, right?
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.560]   And I go upstairs and I see that exactly that thing.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.360]   That's possible. It was all the wine I ordered when I was in Sonoma County.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   Oh, that's what it was. Why do you have to sign for? An adult has to sign for.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.240]   That'd be funnier to pretend it was the adapter, though.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.920]   So it says on there, look, see Alice, it says schedule deliveries anytime you want.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:54.160]   So UPS.com/join. So I thought, I can schedule them.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.720]   You have to pay. And not only do you have to pay, you have to join.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.400]   There's some special level. It's like gold level support.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.760]   And then it's five bucks delivery. So I paid five bucks to have it delivered here.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.200]   Five bucks it cost me.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.440]   And UPS store in Petaluma is open to from like noon to three.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.800]   Yeah, I should have just gone there. Eastern time.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.560]   Every time that happens, I just go, I cannot believe Amazon left FedEx.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.160]   I cannot believe Amazon left FedEx.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:27.600]   Speaking of which, I got a call from Comcast, the executive office yesterday.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.960]   Because I tweeted because the Comcast installer actually was a joke tweet.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.360]   It wasn't a complaint. I said the Comcast installer looked at it, looked at the install and said,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.520]   "Oh, we're going to be here a long time." So I tweeted that.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.080]   And apparently, I don't know, it's called Radian 6.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.600]   Have you heard of Radian 6?
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.160]   What's that?
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.200]   That's one of all these companies.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.400]   So if you know that a company is using Radian 6 and you have a large following,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.840]   you know that you have leverage.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.360]   What Radian 6 is, it's a product that basically lets them scan all of the...
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.480]   That's what's happening.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   Because I didn't see every social network tag.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   No, every social network of their name comes up.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.360]   But not only does it show that you complain about it,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.480]   it shows basically their own internal version of cloud,
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.720]   which is they're like, "This person did this."
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.560]   And yeah, a lot of people are following them.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.640]   You might want to actually respond quickly.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.720]   They respond to a lot of them, but definitely Radian 6 has changed everything.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.120]   Maybe because I wasn't really nice, like, "Oh, thank you, Comcast, the executive.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.840]   Call me." So I started to tell her all the things wrong with Comcast.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.680]   I said, "Look, you guys are a monopoly. You run like a monopoly.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   You're..." I mean, I just... I ticked them off.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.160]   Apparently, I ticked her off because I think their job is to kind of say,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.040]   "Womps, we're sorry. We'll make sure we'll take care of this.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.880]   What can we do?" Instead, it was more like, "You better stop tweeting
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.840]   or we're going to break your legs." I mean, it was like, "She was upset."
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.880]   And then, so the finally thing is, and then he... I had signed up for two DVRs.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.480]   He had one with me and it didn't have HDMI on it. It was component.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   And she says, "Oh, yeah, we don't have... We don't do HDMI. We only do component."
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.920]   I said, "What?" I said, "Wait. Hey, I got to hang up. I got to tweet this."
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:16.160]   "I hate it when they call you and you think that their objective is going to be to try to help you,
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.760]   but their objective is to try to convince you that you're wrong about being upset about it."
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.960]   I think that's what it was. I mean, at first I thought, "Oh, this is nice. They're going to try
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.720]   to take care of me." And she was saying things like, "You know, you're only paying $39.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.600]   It was like, why are you upset? Not what can we do to make it better?"
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.360]   Because I'll tell you, the opposite experience is I complained about something being stuck in
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.920]   customs with FedEx, you know, like, and even stuck there for like a week or whatever.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.280]   FedEx was at FedEx's ball. No, it was. So anyway, it was because of the way FedEx was doing something.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.000]   I tweeted it and it was handled in like 24 hours. It was like, I mean, FedEx was just like,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.920]   "How can we help you?" And bam, it was done.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.440]   Well, that was my second tweet is, "How do people get customer service from these companies?
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.560]   If you're not a Twitter user, apparently this is how you get this. Now, how customer service is
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.280]   handled? You have to have a half a million followers and be a Twitter user."
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.720]   So, work hard. Start tweeting.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.320]   Start tweeting. We'll build that cloud score. You saw the cloud is so silly.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.120]   What's your cloud score?
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.760]   I'm very high.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.400]   I built it up. So there was one point where I had built, because I got really focused on,
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.920]   I figured out how to manipulate cloud.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.040]   K-L-O-U-T, that kind of thing.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.560]   Yeah, so I figured it out.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.520]   Like, you know, it's...
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.560]   Are you a Clush bag?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.320]   Something like a year ago.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.200]   This is a year ago.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.320]   A year ago, I was like, I was very curious about the algorithm that they were using.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.080]   So I figured out that if I tweeted and I got it retweeted and if I got it,
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.120]   you know, like, so I started thinking of very interesting things to tweet and
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.800]   I started thinking about things to put on G+, and I made sure I was registered to all the things,
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.880]   and I did different things on different ones and everything else.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.920]   And I got my cloud score. I got it up to yours.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.240]   Wow.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.520]   Like, it was like...
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.400]   Like, it was up there.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.720]   But I would have had to keep on doing that, to keep it there.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.920]   I know it's not doing anything.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.600]   You think I just kind of sit around?
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.920]   I know you don't get a cloud score 85 just sitting around.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.400]   But I have to.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.600]   You got to work for it there.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.120]   But I have to admit that I was like, anybody who thinks my cloud is the same as Leo's,
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.240]   I'm not following them anymore.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.560]   By the way, it's just like, this is not worth it.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.920]   And these are the kinds of...
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.040]   Now you're way higher than mine.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.560]   This is the kind of crap you get from cloud.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.120]   Congratulations. Your search volume on Bing has increased over the last 90 days.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:13.680]   Right.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.600]   Bing, I mean, obviously, Microsoft bought that, right?
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.240]   That's an ad.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.680]   So anyway...
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.880]   It's a mine like 10, I think.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.320]   So there is a professor at some university who's grading his students based on their cloud score.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.160]   Is that like social media marketing or something?
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.400]   It's like, well, if you could...
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.520]   Instead of doing the work in the class, just get your cloud score up.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.480]   In fact, the New Yorker had a...
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.120]   It can be done.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   The New Yorker had a comic based on it.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.200]   The thing is you have to add followers.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.160]   You cannot...
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   If you start following more people that affects...
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.360]   Well, this is what it used to do anyway.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.160]   It would affect your cloud.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.120]   No one knows how it works.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:43.360]   If you...
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.320]   Right?
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.840]   That's what I was curious about.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.920]   And so I found that if I did these things, it would just...
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.760]   I was like gaining like a point a day.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.720]   You know, I don't know why we're giving them any.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.000]   Imagine airport security, only five minutes long.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:56.480]   Clear.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:56.960]   Clear.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.440]   Clear back.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.240]   That was a clear member.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.040]   I don't know.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.240]   Once your gold doesn't matter.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.840]   So we're really deviating here.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.440]   Oh, the point was also...
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.160]   Radholz.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.040]   Do we still have that music?
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.880]   Should I play the Radholz?
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.600]   I'm like, I got it.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.640]   That's what's in this jingle folder you noted earlier.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.320]   The...
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.800]   And there's an employer who is checking people's Radholz.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.320]   I mean, cloud scores before they...
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.520]   Oh, you didn't have my sound up, eh?
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.560]   Oh, see, what if I suddenly play a Radholz?
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:32.960]   That's it.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.320]   We owe that to Merlin Man, you know.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:34.800]   Yes.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.000]   The king of the Radholz.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.480]   Yes.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.160]   He's got a whole podcast of Radholz.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.080]   The show has become so much more focused since Merlin's.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:40.800]   God, as you can see.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.440]   We also have a long Radholz.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.400]   You want to hear the long one?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:52.720]   This is becoming like the Mandelbrot set of distraction.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.640]   Now we're having a Radholz about the Radholz.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.880]   Now we need my brand new Radholz.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.640]   Totally off top big Radholz.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.280]   Yeah, baby.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.960]   Well, you know what made me think of that?
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.240]   We were watching the Steve Jobs iPhone announcement in 2007.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.440]   And I was remembering sitting in the audience at that.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.880]   And I was scot...
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.520]   Was it you next on my left and scot born on my right?
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.800]   And boy, scot was so excited.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.760]   It was cute.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.640]   He was so cute.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.880]   He was so excited about that iPhone.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.400]   I wonder if he still loves it.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.520]   We should get scot on the show.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.000]   He's been so busy with his photography and stuff.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.440]   But he left us behind.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.160]   He left us.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.200]   Merlin left us too.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.600]   I don't know.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.480]   Eventually they realized this is...
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.440]   We have a pro form.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.000]   Every like three months we ping Merlin, right?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.240]   Right.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.320]   And he goes, "No."
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.040]   He doesn't even go.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.400]   We don't...
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.720]   He's like, "Mr. Inbox Zero ignores us."
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.560]   We're at the bottom of zero.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.760]   But maybe this will prompt him to do it.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.840]   Maybe you could all tweet Merlin and scot,
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.640]   say, beyond that Mac.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.600]   I've got some Mac news.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.040]   I got a rumor.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.280]   Well, let me preface this.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.680]   Because I've gotten two calls in the last two weeks
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.800]   in the radio show from people saying,
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.760]   "I want to buy an iMac, but I hear there's a new one coming."
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.280]   Well, the rumor is that the Mac minis are constrained.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.800]   Supply of the Mac minis are constrained.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.680]   Like you've tried to...
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.000]   I'm way more excited about the Mac minis than I am about the iMac.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.040]   I'm like...
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.480]   Post iMac.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.760]   And I bought...
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.280]   In the last two years,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.040]   we've bought maybe 40 of them of the iMacs.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.960]   We're done with them.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.360]   Why?
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.680]   Because the Mac minis are so much more flexible.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.200]   The only problem with the Mac minis,
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.400]   it doesn't have a fast enough GPU.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.080]   So you end up with...
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.200]   You don't solve that.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.080]   I mean, you don't really.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.440]   If you really want to get crazy about it now,
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.480]   and you can theoretically,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.000]   we think we can plug in a Sonnet box
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.920]   with an Nvidia card on the outside,
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.560]   or something like that.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.480]   But that's the only problem for us.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.120]   But if you're doing...
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.720]   I was at a large broadcast organization,
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.960]   and I was asking them how they handle their 3D renders.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.160]   Like thinking that they had some blades or whatever he goes.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.520]   Yeah, we got 10 Mac minis backwards.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:08:59.920]   Really?
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.800]   Run and run in cinema.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.480]   Yeah, they just cluster them all.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.240]   They're like, they're easy, they're disposable.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.760]   You just throw them back there and just let them render.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.400]   You know, and so...
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.960]   So I think that the Mac mini is...
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.440]   I'm really interested to see whether...
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.320]   I kept on asking and asking and hoping that we see another Mac Pro,
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.920]   and I think that that's probably not going to happen.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.440]   Maybe we'd see one, but now I kind of feel like we're kind of over the hump.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.840]   But I think that the Mac mini built up,
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.360]   you know, the next level of that.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.040]   Because the Mac mini servers are pretty...
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.840]   The ones that we buy for the stuff that we do is pretty beefy.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.200]   I mean, they do a lot of awesome stuff.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.800]   You know, Mac Rumors has the Buyers Guide,
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.480]   where they show, you know, based on rumors and speculation.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.120]   We provide no guarantee to its accuracy, they say.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.680]   You know, the likelihood that we're due.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.560]   And Mac mini iMac and Mac Pro are all red, you know.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.840]   They're also listing the classic.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.760]   Really?
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.360]   They're listing the ones that are going to update the classic.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:53.600]   No.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.080]   So let's just...
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.760]   Mac mini recent rumors, Apple update, nearly entire Mac lineup at WWDC in June.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.880]   No.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.520]   No.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.000]   But now their recommendation is don't buy updates soon.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.840]   The last release was 2011.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.640]   That's not that long.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.560]   It's only been a little more than a year.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.520]   And they base this on the average.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.880]   Now the iMac hasn't been updated in 525 days.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.440]   The last rumor is September 10th,
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.840]   production of 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.240]   and updated iMacs reportedly ramping up.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.520]   Haven't heard a word about that either.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.400]   When would they announce that?
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.440]   If they're going to announce it,
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.200]   it would have to be in the next 30 days, right?
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.160]   The whole thing about the retina thing, is I mean,
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:36.560]   do you really...
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.920]   They're not going to be a retina iMac.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.600]   That's too big a screen.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.880]   I mean, I don't really care.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.000]   I don't really care.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.960]   I have a retina.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.440]   A bunch of them.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.080]   But the only thing that matters to me is that we've got
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.000]   two thunderbolts and an HDMI out.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.680]   And that just changes everything as far as using the computer.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.280]   But I wish I had one more USB.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.880]   But the actual retina display,
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.640]   I think we talked about this earlier.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.680]   I find it a little bit annoying,
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.880]   because I feel like everything's sluggish.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.840]   I feel like it's pushing the processor too hard.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.240]   I have to...
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.320]   I'm going to buy a 27-inch monitor to hook up to that and see.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.200]   See how that works for you?
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.880]   Well, I know one thing.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.040]   The new iPods are here.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.520]   We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.760]   Maybe some iPad mini news.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.600]   And more.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.000]   Allison is here.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.040]   Allison Sheridan from NozillaCast.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.520]   I can't believe I've known you for years.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.840]   I never put two and two together that NozillaCast was Allison backwards.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.160]   I'm such an idiot.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.320]   Well, not the smartest name I've ever come up with, but you know...
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.200]   Well, you don't forget it.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.600]   It's got cast in at least.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.440]   You and I are going to both be on the...
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.480]   There's no point in plugging this,
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.200]   because I think it sold out the Mac Mania Cruise in a month.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.600]   Actually, I'm not sure it is sold out.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.720]   Last time I talked to Captain Eel, it wasn't.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.040]   Oh!
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.760]   It's in my nappy.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.080]   Then Rush, run.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.400]   Right now to insightcruises.com.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.160]   I need...
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.280]   Go ahead.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:01.680]   Sorry.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.960]   Do you want to go?
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.640]   No, no, I was just saying I need to send you that absurd inflatable...
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.880]   inflatable lap pillow.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.440]   Oh, yeah, because I got a log.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.080]   It's got my log.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.120]   I got a freaking flight to...
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.960]   I got a 14-1/2 hour flight coming up.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.200]   Well, speaking of Mr. Inbox Zero,
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.080]   I sent you an email a couple of weeks ago,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.880]   saying, "What address do you want me to send it to?"
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.320]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.600]   No, I don't read my email.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.400]   What are you calling me?
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:28.880]   What are you calling me?
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.200]   That's...
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:35.520]   You know, we checked into what a cost-to-fly business class round trip on Qantas.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:35.920]   What is that?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.240]   $19,000 a person.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.760]   Myles.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.640]   You need an IELTS.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.320]   Bob Mansfield, I'm still on pain that comes from.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.800]   I got a good price.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.080]   An economy plus in the unit.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.320]   I think it was 1740 round trip.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.760]   Oh, man.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.440]   We just did economy plus.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.560]   It was a lot more than that.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.360]   I don't know how I...
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:53.840]   I don't know how...
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.800]   $4,000 a piece?
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.040]   Whoa!
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.320]   Yeah!
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:56.800]   Yeah!
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.360]   Doying!
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.200]   That's 40,000 miles.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.800]   That's 40,000 miles.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.440]   It was 40,000 miles each way to Sydney.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.000]   Each way.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.240]   With...
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.040]   You know, just from economy,
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.880]   but you have to have the right code.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.240]   So...
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.040]   It's ridiculous.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.800]   I just anyway, so I'm going to just be...
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.000]   I have actually a number of devices, Andy.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   I've got that pillow that lets me...
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:18.320]   Kind of...
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.360]   This is all from the Gizwiz.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.080]   We do this new feature of the Gizwiz crap I found on Sky Mall.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.040]   And...
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.840]   It's fun, because I have a ton of crap now.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.600]   So it's a pillow that you put in...
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.760]   Andy was supposed to use, but he couldn't have the nerve.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.800]   Okay.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.520]   Well, I also had an open seat next to me.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.280]   And so...
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.880]   You see, then when you got an open seat,
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.080]   you want to just sort of like scootch over and just sort of lean against the window.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.120]   I had a good restful night that way.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.720]   Well, I got a pillow that I can actually...
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   You've inflated.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.160]   It's about this...
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.920]   It's about a foot and a half tall.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.440]   You put it on the tray table,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.200]   and then you sleep leaned over.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.720]   And then I've ordered from Kickstarter.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.760]   I don't know if it'll come in time.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.440]   The ostrich thing that you put over your head and your arms in it,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.880]   the ostrich pillow.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.000]   And then I have a head...
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.120]   So...
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.400]   So basically you look like a...
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.800]   You look like a prisoner being transported from Gitmo.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.680]   There's only...
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.400]   You look like...
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:08.880]   There's only...
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.360]   There's only...
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.800]   You're not allowed to knock yourself there, too.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.600]   There's only one device you're missing.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:13.920]   What?
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.960]   A bottle of maker's mark.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.320]   Makes every flight.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   Are you allowed to bring that on the plane?
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.400]   You don't have to bring the little...
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.200]   Technically not.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.160]   No, that's what I thought.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.600]   How do you get the liquid through it?
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.960]   I don't trip on the plane anymore.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.360]   I don't trip.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.480]   Oh, you buy it at the duty station.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.120]   You wake up all...
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.640]   Yeah, you don't rest up.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.560]   But it does make you sleep better, but once you get there, then...
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.680]   I'm just bringing heroin.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.880]   I hear that's good.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.280]   So...
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.560]   And then I have a...
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.760]   I'm joking, kids.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.400]   FB Cool, Stan School, FAA and TSA.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.840]   He will not be having...
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.920]   You don't need to search that special place...
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.040]   Oh, oh, shoot.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.680]   ...when we get right to go inside.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.880]   He's definitely...
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.840]   I am not...
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.800]   I am not...
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.920]   No, I am not!
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.120]   Of hellos, not.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.000]   Good doggie.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.040]   Good doggie.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:53.280]   No!
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.880]   What was I thinking?
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.520]   And then I have a massager that goes over your back,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.360]   that massages your back.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.320]   You strap that on.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.640]   So, give me a hand for your feet?
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.920]   And then a hand for your feet?
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.840]   So, because I don't want to get...
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.720]   What is it, phlebitis?
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.880]   What is the thing that you get on airplanes?
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.120]   You know, where you get a stroke and you die.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.160]   So, it's a leg massager that does it with inflatable air.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.840]   So, it inflates it and then it deflates it.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.280]   And so, I put those on.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.800]   So, TSA, don't worry about the guy with the electric device
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.280]   of rust apt around his feet and ankles
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.720]   that he's got underneath the penalty.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.160]   I don't think there should be a penalty for trying to become...
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.200]   When you're walking through the airport...
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.480]   You look like King Kong, like...
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.840]   What?
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.560]   You know what?
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.520]   I'm liking my chances.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   I might actually be part of this cruise after all.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.640]   Getting like a last-minute call from Captain Neil.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.600]   He's like, "Yeah, Leo is still being held."
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.800]   You know how Australia was founded?
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.040]   It was a prison colony for England.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.520]   They still have some of those jails left.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.040]   And I may be visiting one of them.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.600]   I'm told that everybody in Australia knows what their heritage is.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.720]   Wouldn't you be interested?
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.040]   Like, what was your great, great, great,
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.640]   grandfather transported for?
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:03.280]   Right?
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.240]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.880]   No, we had friends and I think we asked.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.320]   Because we were like, it was one of the things like,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.640]   we hear that all the Australians, he goes, "Oh yeah, I'm a settler.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.280]   She's penal."
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.840]   Like, it was like, "Yeah, that was..."
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.960]   You know, it's...
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.880]   Anyway, I will be there.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.240]   Don McAllister will be there.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.400]   Sal Sigoyan of who's great.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.480]   I mean, he's the greatest on Automator and Apple.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.280]   Sal is so much fun.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:25.760]   I love Sal.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.240]   I'm terrified to talk to me.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.200]   He's way too smart.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.000]   Oh, no.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   The most fun is getting Sal.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.960]   Sal in Naomi.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.840]   Yeah, around a...
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.360]   We were gonna have such a good time.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:35.840]   At dinner.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.240]   It's just...
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:36.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.520]   Such a good time.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.640]   You're gonna love this.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.720]   So it's still available.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.920]   Absolutely go to Insight Cruises.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.640]   I had no idea.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.920]   Macmania 15.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.040]   Now it's short notice.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.840]   November 7th through the 21st, it's next month.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.120]   It's two weeks you'll be gone.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.000]   Not only are you gonna have these lectures as part of
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.600]   Macmania from all of us,
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.560]   I'm giving a lecture on social media for yourself
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.160]   and social media for your business.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.840]   A lecture on how you could do media like a new media.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840]   And I can't remember something else.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.200]   Oh, on Mountain Lion.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.160]   Don does like three, two lectures.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.080]   They always pour Don.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:12.880]   Allison, you're doing...
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.240]   Yeah, I have to do six 90-minute unique speeches.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.880]   And I've been writing since March and I'm freaking out.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.400]   But it's gonna be just relaxed.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:20.880]   It's fine.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.160]   It's these people love.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.200]   It's so much fun.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.800]   You're there with about 150 crazed Mac fanatics.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.320]   And it's so much fun.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.120]   And then we're gonna go to a boar, a boar, no not boar, a boar.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.800]   Oh, that'd be good though.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.160]   Somewhere like in the...
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.040]   New Caledonia.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.000]   New Caledonia.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.640]   Numea Ile de Pa.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.240]   Ia Ia so Leifu.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.600]   We're gonna see the total eclipse of the sun.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.120]   Bonnie Tyler will be performing.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.080]   No.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   I was like really?
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.560]   And Hamlet?
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.000]   Sorry, Hamlet excited.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.720]   Hamlet, there's one of the expeditions
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.280]   Excursions is in Brisbane.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.720]   You could Pat a koala and Boxer the Kangaroo.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.360]   I'm gonna do that.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.160]   You're gonna Boxer the Kangaroo.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.000]   You know they watch for the uppercut.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.880]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.840]   I know they're tough.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.800]   The Kangaroos particularly want to be boxed with by tourists.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.080]   Apparently they don't mind.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.040]   I bet you they would love to kick the crap out of a tourist.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.680]   I mean I bet the Kangaroos just talk about it.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.040]   You walk in they just go poo.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.320]   You see the way they're spying Tim.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.280]   I'll be honest.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.000]   They do have those raptor like claws on the feet.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.320]   If they didn't want to be there I don't think they'd have to be.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.240]   You're right.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.600]   They shouldn't have signed the release if they didn't want to take the risk
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.160]   of getting in the squared circle with Mr. Leo LaPorte.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.120]   They know that's gonna happen.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.760]   We're going to El Firioso Diablo is entering the ring.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.080]   Thank you.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.440]   You're gonna use those leche moves on.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.880]   Anyway, I didn't realize Alison there were still rooms because this one.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.720]   The Kangaroos said it was filling up pretty fast but this is good.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.000]   So Alison and I'll be on it along with some others including.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.440]   Let me add my own endorsement.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.960]   Every cruise I've gone on.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.600]   So much fun.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.720]   Even as a guy who has to prepare those like six, 90-minute unique speeches
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.160]   I've never given before so I've got to write all this stuff and present all this stuff.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.320]   It's I considered a huge, huge blast.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   Enjoy it hanging out with everybody that was there.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.400]   I usually learn at least as much as I dispense in terms of education and just great, great stuff.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.080]   We're going to take a quick break.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:22.880]   Come back with more.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.560]   Like I said, the new iPods.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.320]   That's what I thought maybe you got, Alison.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.040]   I ordered one.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.880]   We'll have to check the front desk see if it's arrived.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.000]   Apparently they're coming out but first a word from Squarespace.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.080]   Everything you need to create an exceptional website.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.440]   The brand new Squarespace is out Squarespace 6.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.640]   So now you get not only the best hosting anywhere,
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.360]   hosting that just you cannot bring to its knees.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.480]   I mean it is strong robust but also the best software running on top of it for maximum security.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.240]   I love Squarespace.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.840]   I know you will too and I want you to give it a try by just going to squarespace.com.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.720]   Two weeks free when you click that yellow get started button.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.440]   You'll see the mobile responsive designs that automatically size your site to the right screen.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.360]   Everything's adjusted automatically so you don't have to even think about having a mobile site.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.040]   It's all perfect.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.880]   The templates are gorgeous.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:14.240]   If you're a photographer, an artist, if you need a portfolio site, this is really the place you
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.040]   should be going.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.880]   Especially when you take a look at the pricing.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.560]   We're talking about hosting and software.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.760]   They'll even if you sign up for a year plan which is your best deal,
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.400]   throw in the domain name registration.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.280]   They'll hook it up so it automatically goes to your Squarespace site.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.560]   For 16 bucks a month when you buy a year's plan you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries,
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.640]   unlimited blogs, bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.920]   I mean this just is fantastic.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.280]   I mean if you've been putting off doing this, I mean putting off making a website because it was
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.320]   too complicated.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.680]   I mean this is the solution.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.720]   I mean it really is.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.200]   It's funny we had Ryan Block on a couple of weeks ago.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.520]   Ryan and Veronica Belmont got married and they used, I don't know they had like there's some
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.280]   sort of service for wedding sites.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.320]   They said it was awful.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.640]   So they said, "We're just going to do a Squarespace site."
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.960]   They quickly set up a Blockmont Squarespace site.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.560]   And so that's what it's really good for.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.280]   Even the two-week deal if you've got an event coming up, if you've got a new friend with a newborn,
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.160]   what a great gift to create a site for them, send it to them.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.000]   Squarespace.com.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Now if you do decide to buy, make sure you use the offer code MACBreak10 and you'll get 10% off
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.280]   your first purchase.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.080]   And if it's a yearly purchase which I would recommend, you're going to save the maximum
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.160]   amount of money, significant savings.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.680]   squarespace.com.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.160]   Offer code MACBreak10.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.320]   I wish I could hold it up right now but the new iPods are apparently shipping.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.720]   They said October sometime.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.560]   I don't know anybody, has anybody received one yet?
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.320]   No.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.960]   Are we excited about them?
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.680]   I have an iPhone.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.160]   I'm going to really miss the clip.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.760]   I wear this thing everywhere.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.960]   I wear it all the time.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.080]   It's just everywhere I go.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.000]   That's the previous Nano.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.400]   And not having a clip.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.360]   I really, really like the clip.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.160]   I don't want it's some big clunky thing that holds it, that gives it a clip.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.160]   I also love the flexibility of that design.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.640]   I admit that I wasn't a big fan of it.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.160]   But what I appreciated most about it is that you could use it in so many different ways.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.080]   And I really, I was so looking forward to the idea of a Nano with this exact same design,
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.480]   which had Bluetooth in it that could support some sort of communication between the iPhone
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.200]   and the thing.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.440]   So I do have a watch brand for the Nano.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.040]   But I rarely wound up using it because I don't like, I can't remember to charge my watch once a week.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.000]   Or to have a good wire coming out of it.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.920]   That's not really going to work so good.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.400]   The big wire I would have liked.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.120]   Cass, I think it was a sharper, sharper Cassie.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.160]   I think it was sharp.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.280]   Like in the 80s made a TV wristwatch where it was just like an L.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.160]   All they did was take like a micro LCD screen and you had to like carry the tuner pack like
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.600]   inside your jacket pocket.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.520]   And I like the fact that there was a wire, I didn't wire running up your arm there.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.600]   That was exactly in the line with me as a consumer.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.440]   I want wires running places.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.440]   But yeah, I'm curious to see how much I like the new Nano.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.480]   Because as you can see, fitness is my life.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:25.760]   And the placement of the Nano has always been people who are using them in gems,
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.200]   people using it on walks and runs.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.000]   I've been told that those kind of people actually prefer the shuffle because it's so tiny, but
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.560]   we'll find out.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.760]   I was really hoping we'd get iOS 6 on it and not change the form factor.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.840]   Because I really want to have downcast on there.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.280]   I'm tired of sinking with iTunes.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.080]   That's over.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.800]   And I'm tired of Apple's podcast app too, by the way.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.280]   That's a...
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:45.840]   Oh God.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:46.720]   Junk.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.160]   So disappointing.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.440]   That could have been such a help to us.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.800]   I like the sweetheart.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.760]   It could have been a container.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:51.920]   I could have been a container.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.880]   Talk about it where, you know, he's such a sweetheart and he's like,
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.400]   "Well, you know, it's okay, but it could have done more."
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.160]   It's okay.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.520]   I've had many rumors.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.120]   I'm starting to wonder if this event's going to happen.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.920]   We would see an invitation on the 10th tomorrow, right, if it's the 17th.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.400]   That's the one.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.080]   Either today or tomorrow if it were the 17th.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:18.320]   Yes.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.480]   So we're waiting.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.280]   Nobody's received.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.000]   Nobody's received.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.120]   I mean, you know, of course, as soon as...
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.840]   I haven't gotten one.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.520]   Good luck.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.080]   You know who you're sitting next to, don't you?
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.440]   I'm Apple Apostate Number One.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.240]   There's no...
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:42.080]   You know, I got to say, a company hates me more if I were a fan than if I never were a fan, right?
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:45.200]   It's like if Walt Mossberg turned against Apple, he would be...
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.720]   Something you want to fan is just that you...
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.120]   You skyped with a laptop.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:49.600]   I don't think that...
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.760]   I swear to God, I don't think I had anything to do with it.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.560]   No, no, you definitely got the Steve Stincai on that one.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.080]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.120]   That's why I claimed a fan.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.720]   Who is that guy?
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.200]   I've gotten a distinct email from Steve, but not a Stincai.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:01.680]   The Steve Stincai.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.360]   That belongs on a t-shirt.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.640]   The next t-shirt design.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.160]   I think Leo LaPortz used to capture it a lot.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.440]   I think I got it on this...
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   I don't know what it was about the way you looked when you were doing it to us.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.520]   It's emblazoned in my memory as you're sitting there going,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.600]   "Look at my so dorky with this big laptop."
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.400]   Yeah, how can you hate me?
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.200]   You ever looked dorky?
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.000]   How could you hate me?
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.640]   Anyway, iPad Mini, if we're going to see it, we're going to see it soon.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.360]   There are more leaks.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.560]   This to me does not...
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.040]   I don't know.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.360]   They say the business insider Steve Kovach says,
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.960]   "The most convincing iPad Mini leaked photos we've seen yet, are you convinced?"
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.480]   Not me.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.560]   This is an easy Photoshop, if you ask me.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.240]   I don't know.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.160]   What's Mini 4?
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.760]   What?
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.480]   What's it 4?
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.840]   Who is it 4?
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.920]   It's for all the people that are buying the...
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.000]   Nexus 7, and 7.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:54.560]   Nexus 7.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.560]   Well, but are they buying the Nexus 7 because it's 200 bucks or because it's 7 inches?
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.480]   A little bit of both.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.520]   I have to admit that I really thought about it for a while,
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.160]   and I think I would actually use a Mini more than my iPad,
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.040]   because I think that my iPad is too close to my 11 inch.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   So I have a tendency, if I...
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.480]   When I need to have a little bit more,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.640]   I realize that I would probably carry around a Mini a lot more than the iPad.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.920]   See, I'm wondering whether it's...
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.760]   As a female persuasion person, I carry my iPad and my purse,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.920]   so it's no problem, but if I didn't have a purse,
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.840]   I think I probably wouldn't carry it around at all.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.600]   Oh, but a Mini would fit in the purse better,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.280]   and then you'd have more room for cosmetics.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.880]   You can use a smaller purse.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.840]   Yeah, what are those?
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   I got my purse at REI, I should say that too.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.280]   Good for you, I like it.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.680]   In education, this is web 3628 pointed out, education.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.640]   I think education is going to be a more cost-effective iPad.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.680]   I mean, I think Apple still, their main competitor,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.840]   as we look into the not too distant future,
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.400]   is not necessarily Nexus 7 or anything else.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.320]   It is the OLPC and everything else.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.680]   I mean, our education system, the world's education systems,
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.080]   are about to get a huge overhaul.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.960]   So that could be a big boost to iBooks Author then?
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   Well, and just using a platform that is easy to manage,
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.480]   I think that the argument that Apple's making
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.320]   to a lot of schools that we've heard
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.440]   is that it's just a lot easier.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.480]   It's going to be a lot easier for you to manage and secure
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.640]   your tablets if you use iOS as opposed to Android.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.280]   You know, from kids who might know more about the OS than you do.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.840]   That's the, you know, it's so that it's one of the issues.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.000]   I also think that they're looking at,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.640]   when Apple executives fly on airplanes,
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.880]   they see that they only see two tablets in people's hands.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.360]   They see iPads and they see kindles.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.440]   And they have to think that there are a lot of people
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.400]   that have looked at the iPad, they're aware of the iPad.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.360]   They don't want to spend, either they don't want to spend $399
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.920]   or they don't want something that's 10 inches across,
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.600]   or they don't want something that, believe it or not,
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.760]   is as complicated as the iPad.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.760]   So I think that's not the case of seeing money
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.200]   that they're leaving on the table.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.000]   If they can find a way to put an iPad in the hands
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.080]   of those people who ordinarily are going to be
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.120]   one clicking $119 Kindle Paperwhite,
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.920]   that is a way to extend the brand to tens of millions of people
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.360]   if they're not reaching right now.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.240]   I do think there's a serious divide between,
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.440]   they're people who will never buy an iPad.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.960]   It doesn't matter how good it is,
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.000]   it doesn't matter how much they improve the operating system.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.720]   They are just no way, know how interested in the Tenage tab,
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.000]   what they just don't have a spot in their life for that.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.240]   But they certainly do have a spot in their life for a book reader.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.880]   They certainly do have a spot for something that can Facebook
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880]   or something that can play games and play movies.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   And that's what the iPad mini will be targeted towards.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.280]   John Pachowski writing in The All Things D,
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.480]   and he's pretty well connected,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.040]   says the new iPad mini could outshine the new iPad.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.040]   Chatter from Apple's overseas supply chain indicates the company
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.760]   has not been cutting corners in efforts
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.120]   to keep the iPad's diminutive sibling price competitive
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.040]   with what will surely be its two greatest rivals,
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.440]   Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle's Fire.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.440]   Topeka analyst Brian White, who says he's been traveling around Taipei
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.880]   talking to component suppliers,
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.760]   says Apple did not skimp on the aesthetics.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.560]   In fact, we believe the iPad mini could outshine it
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.000]   in terms of how the device feels.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.320]   Wall Street Journal reports that some Asian component partners
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.040]   have received orders to make more than 10 million
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.640]   for the fourth quarter.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.160]   That makes sense.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.920]   10 million is the new 5 million.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.200]   Which was the new million.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.320]   New million, exactly.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.160]   Pretty interesting.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.680]   We'll hear soon, of course, you know what, when we'll hear it,
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.720]   right after this shows over.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.960]   Of course, which is any minute now.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.120]   Let me, before we end this show, talk about Citrix,
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.320]   because I should have talked about them sooner and I apologize,
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.160]   but you know, it's been exciting with all the rat holes.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.960]   I've been distracted a little bit by my pick of the week as well,
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.840]   as you probably noticed.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.560]   You gotta get your score.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.040]   I'm not going to say something.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.800]   It's not on the orskay.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.200]   If folks, have you tried go to meeting?
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.440]   When you meet, you know, people like Alex,
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.640]   really, this is Alex is a new normal, but they're never,
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.000]   they're like gadflies.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.240]   They're never in the same place two days in a row.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.000]   So how do you meet with them?
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.600]   And meetings, I know nobody likes meeting,
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.760]   but meetings are exactly what keeps people in the same page.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.720]   We did away with meetings for a year and the whole place fell apart.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.560]   And we said, we aren't having meetings again.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.600]   Staff meetings.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.640]   You gotta communicate.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.680]   You gotta keep people in touch.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.640]   You gotta train.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.600]   You gotta collaborate.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.840]   And goodness knows, if you're in sales in any way,
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.800]   you gotta pitch the best way to do a go to meeting,
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.440]   because it doesn't matter where your clients or colleagues are.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.480]   If they've got an iPad or an iPhone, they can join a meeting.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.960]   You can start a meeting from your Mac or your PC.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.040]   Everybody's on the same page, because everybody's looking at your screen.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.480]   They can even share their screen with you.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.680]   And here's the best part with a new HD faces feature.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.800]   If your Mac or PC has a camera, even the iPad camera,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.680]   you can see them.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.880]   They can see you.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.760]   And that is so important for building rapport, building trust,
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.240]   communicating, body language, all that stuff.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.280]   You gotta see it.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.080]   HD faces is so beautiful.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.920]   So crystal clear, it's integrated beautifully.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.960]   And with the screen sharing, you can move people around them and size them and stuff.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.800]   So it always fits the screen.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.720]   Works even on the iPad.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.840]   I have to say, that is a particularly big selling point for me,
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.600]   because that's a lightweight way I can be anywhere, even the backyard,
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.120]   and still attend a meeting.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.320]   Go to meeting.com.

[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.440]   And she'll say, "Yes, and I'm here to give you one million dollars."
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.640]   Or not.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.160]   Actually, more likely not.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.600]   Go to me.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.880]   I'm not promising anything.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:55.520]   I'm just saying.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.720]   Go to meeting, but it could happen.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.160]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.160]   The promo code is MACBreak.

[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.120]   I don't know if it would work.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.440]   I think it would work on an iPad mini kind of out of the box,
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.280]   because the rumors were hanging about the iPad mini.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.160]   It's essentially an iPad 2, 10, 24 by 7, 68, in a smaller form factor.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.960]   So that means all of the software that works on an iPad 2 should still work.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.480]   I hope so.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.280]   I hope so too.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.880]   Wouldn't it be funny if they just don't even do it?
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.160]   I don't think it's completely photophistic at this point.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.000]   I mean, but I think that...
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   Shouldn't, but you're right, because the rumors...
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.840]   And I have to admit, we had some requests within the company to buy some more iPads for management.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.400]   Because a lot...
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.760]   So you're waiting, because you were all waiting.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.120]   You will be 200 bucks? No, it won't.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:41.760]   I need to buy it.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.560]   I need to be 300.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:42.560]   I need to be 300.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.040]   300.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.520]   If I was going to guess, 350, 300.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.160]   What do you say?
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.760]   300 for the base model.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.040]   Two minutes.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.720]   I think that if the cheapest MAC mini is 300 bucks,
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.680]   that was sort of...
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.120]   That was sort of trigger my...
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.800]   What was the point then, reflex?
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.160]   It needs to be cheaper.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:02.400]   I think that if Apple does it for 200 bucks,
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.960]   they kill Android 7-inch tablets.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.280]   And they will leave some wiggle room for a device like the Kindle Fire HD,
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.040]   because it's much, much simpler to use.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:15.360]   If it's $250, there's room for them to operate,
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.960]   but they still have to...
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.480]   But these other competitors have to say,
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.840]   "Well, why wouldn't I spend $50 more to have the best tablet style that's on the market today?"
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.440]   If it's 300 bucks, that might as well be $3,000 for the people who have not bought an iPad yet.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.760]   Because why would they spend...
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.280]   Apple then is on the defensive.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:40.560]   Have to say, "Why is this worth $100 more than these two other tablets that cost $100 less?"
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.000]   And from the perspective of somebody who's interested in a 7-inch tablet,
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   would say, "Well, but this $200 device does everything I want the $300 device to do,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.680]   but I have 100 bucks more in my pocket."
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.480]   So I would be shocked if it were 300 bucks.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.800]   -You think they could make it at 200?
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.720]   They could actually create a $200 iPad?
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.760]   -I don't know.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.000]   -And make the giant profits that they like to make, right?
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.240]   -We haven't seen them purposely go in and try to match the low end.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:06.560]   -Ever.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.640]   -When the MP3 players came out and they were vastly cheaper than the iPads,
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.960]   and yet the iPads continued to sell better.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:17.040]   One thing I was thinking about was they tend to do a 100, 100, 100 kind of a thing, right?
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.920]   If they come in at 300, you'll have a $300 or $400 or $500, $600, $700, right?
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.000]   You've got this full $100 deal.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.680]   -Well, and I do think that 199 is scorched earth.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.040]   I mean, I think that that...
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.560]   I think Apple's big issue is...
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:36.240]   I don't remember what the exact stat was in our notes,
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.680]   but it was something between...
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.080]   I think it was...
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.600]   They used to be 82 percent.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.120]   Last year, they were 82 percent of the market,
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.920]   and now they're 51 percent of the market or 52 percent of the market.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.400]   So obviously, they need to do something decisive there to not lose that market share.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.800]   And I think that 199 is scorched earth.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.080]   I mean, I think it becomes very, very difficult for the Android market to recover that.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.360]   But my guess is it's 249 or 299 is where they're going to land.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.840]   I don't think they're going to go for the killing blow.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.480]   Apple tends to be just short of that.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.320]   -Well, I hope we'll find that soon.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:17.200]   What do you think of this?
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.040]   This news came out today.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.240]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.040]   The US Congress has been working on a study of Huawei,
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.600]   the Chinese phone company, and ZTE, which is another Chinese phone company,
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   and have made the recommendation that federal government employees do not buy
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:39.920]   gear phones, particularly from Huawei, because of their ties to the Chinese military.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.600]   They're afraid that they could have...
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.960]   There's a security threat.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.040]   The US bipartisan report from the House accused two of China's largest telecom companies of being
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.400]   arms of the government that had stolen intellectual property from American companies and could potentially
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.720]   be spying on Americans.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:10.480]   I got to point out that every phone we use, including the iPhones and iPads are made in China.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:16.640]   Now, there isn't the talk about Foxconn having another plant in Brazil.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.280]   Is that correct?
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.440]   They're going to build a Brazilian plant.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.920]   And that's because Brazil charges such high tariffs.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.320]   So this is just the supply of the Brazilian market?
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.840]   I think it's just the supply of the Brazilian market.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.240]   It's also very hard to mail anything to Brazil in the case you're wondering.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.840]   Getting geared at Brazil.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.120]   This isn't specifically an Apple story, but I think interesting.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.200]   Huawei makes a lot of low-end consumer electronics gear, and I don't think we'd really thought about
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:52.400]   this. And the real concern also is it's not merely cyber warfare, but it's IP theft that they would
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.560]   use it to listen in on company meetings and stuff.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.160]   Wow.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.640]   Series, strange movie reviews.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.680]   So these are the best movie reviews ever.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.120]   So this is a series Easter actually.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:07.600]   Try it.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.760]   Do I have a...
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.960]   I should have checked.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:12.240]   Do I have an input for this?
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.360]   Yeah, it's below the table.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.400]   It's kind of hanging down next to Alex in between you and Alex.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.040]   You, I see it.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.640]   Oh, look at it.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:21.200]   Wow.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.320]   These guys think of everything.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.200]   This is magic.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.240]   All right.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.600]   So what should I ask Siri?
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.760]   What are the things of Luper?
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.160]   You know what?
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:28.480]   You know what?
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.000]   I tried that one.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:30.880]   Luper didn't work.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.720]   Oh, all right.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.560]   Well, let's ask her about the Wizard of Oz.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.200]   I'm going to do a simple tip.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.480]   Work.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.440]   So what do you do?
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.640]   How do you ask?
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.360]   What should I say?
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.840]   Siri, what is your review of?
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   What is this movie about,
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.720]   give it a movie name?
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.520]   What is this movie about?
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.480]   The Wizard of Oz?
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.840]   I'm not getting it.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:57.440]   Looking up Wizard of Oz.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.680]   I found a few movies matching Wizard of Oz.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.920]   So do I have to get a review?
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.480]   I did just the fun ones that were listed there.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.120]   Okay.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.160]   You just say, you know,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.120]   what's the what's the thought of?
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:09.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:09.600]   Okay.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.080]   Here we go.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:10.480]   Here we go.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.720]   Tell me about inception.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.440]   Searching the web for inception.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.600]   Maybe they fixed it.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600]   That would be a bummer.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.760]   What's the syntax?
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.280]   Try what is 2001 about?
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.840]   Say space Odyssey, too.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.560]   I'm going to hold it down.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.320]   I don't know how to use Siri.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.920]   What is 2001 a space Odyssey about?
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.560]   It's about an assistant named Hal who tries to make contact with the higher intelligence.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.200]   These two guys get in the way and mess it all up.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:47.840]   That's good.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.960]   So that's her, you know, unique perspective.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.640]   I like that.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:58.560]   I would love it if you know how like Google actually has artists hired on staff to do nothing but
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.080]   work on Google doodles.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.240]   I would love it if Apple hired people on staff.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:02.640]   Siri people.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:05.760]   Nothing but to give Siri funny material.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.800]   And you think that hasn't happened?
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.720]   Somebody's doing it.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.320]   What's the story of Blade Runner?
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:10.880]   What is that just like?
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:15.760]   Let me think about that.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.640]   This might answer your...
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:16.880]   Oh.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.880]   She actually gave me a Wolfram Alpha Synopsis of Blade Runner.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.640]   Oh man.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:22.880]   She's going to...
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.080]   Tell me about Blade Runner.
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.240]   Searching the web for Blade Runner.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.280]   Maybe, but you know, it's...
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.800]   There must be some specific syntax that I'm not.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.040]   Okay.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.240]   Uh...
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.640]   What's the plot of the Matrix?
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.240]   Which of these were you interested in?
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.760]   It's giving me all the different.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.560]   It's about Keanu Reeves in reality and Red Pills and Blue Pills and Black Leather and Guns.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.640]   But mostly about Keanu Reeves.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.280]   I bookery suggest you say Siri who shot first.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.160]   Oh.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.840]   Who shot first?
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.520]   This might answer your question.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   She gave me Wolfram Alpha's answer.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.160]   By the way, Wolfram Alpha says hand solo shot first.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.080]   So I don't know.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.480]   I don't know.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.560]   That's validating its data set.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.720]   Square is coming to Starbucks in early November.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:29.920]   I'm excited about this.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.000]   I'll be able to pay with my iPhone.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.600]   Or my Android phone just to be completely fair about all of this.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.440]   It's...
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.520]   I guess it's through the Starbucks mobile app.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.400]   'Cause remember Starbucks invested $25 million in the firm Square Square.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.080]   Does those little do-hick-easy attach to a phone and...
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.000]   And you don't need to do-hick-easy-pays.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:52.480]   No, you don't.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.680]   To get paid, you need to do it.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.000]   No.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.480]   The pay with Square is fantastic.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.040]   I just love it.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:57.920]   You have it an acre copy.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.640]   Acre over here.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.200]   I do it all the time.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:00.480]   I go in there more because of that.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:00.960]   Yep.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.520]   And it kind of makes you feel special because you could just say,
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.480]   "Yeah, put it on Leo."
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.400]   And they got a picture of me and...
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.680]   And you could even put a tip on it.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.640]   Although they don't have tip support in this new version.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.120]   They'll offer tip support later in the...
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.480]   So you don't tap it, scan it, anything.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.880]   You just walk into the place and they start making your order?
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.160]   It uses geofencing.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.160]   So they know when I've walked in.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:26.720]   I...
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.560]   You can actually turn it on and I stopped doing this
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.000]   because I walk by acre all the time.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.080]   So I figure that I'm popping up on their screen.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.080]   Because so you can actually do it automatically.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.280]   Like when you arrive, it just does it.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.040]   Or you can say, "Hey, I'm here."
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.880]   And then it uses geofencing.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.960]   And then it pops up on their iPad.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.840]   A picture of me.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.080]   And then I say, "Yeah, I'm Leo."
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.360]   And then I'd like a coffee.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.480]   And they say, "Okay, Leo."
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:50.080]   And then on the pay with Square, you can give them a tip.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.160]   But it's like in big large increments.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.320]   Like a buck, two bucks, five bucks, 100 bucks.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.120]   I don't understand that.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.000]   Apple is shipping new software for iPhone 4.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.040]   Perhaps 9 to 5 Mac speculates.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.880]   It's China's iPhone version.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.400]   China mobile's iPhone version.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.720]   We haven't seen it.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.520]   But I don't have an iPhone 4, so.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.920]   And apparently, again, almost like...
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.640]   This is almost like a Easter egg.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.840]   You can add some interesting historic tickets
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:28.160]   to your past book, Fion, or is it Flaun?
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.600]   I guess it's Flaun Solutions.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.600]   It's put together some fun historic events,
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.160]   concerts, and coupons to put in your past book,
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.320]   including the Titanic, the Wright Brothers' first flight,
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:45.280]   Starship Enterprise, SpaceX.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.120]   I like that one going to the space station.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.560]   That was it.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.680]   We showed that on Sunday.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.400]   So this is a reaction to nobody can figure out
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.840]   what to do with past book yet.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.920]   Because they've got these little fake things.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.600]   I have the sailing of the Santa Maria
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:05.760]   from Spain to the New World, August 3rd, 1492,
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.000]   departing at 1830, Captain Christopher Columbus.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.200]   I added them.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.560]   I'm very excited that I have them.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.520]   Did you see them now?
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.840]   Yeah, but I don't know what to do for.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.560]   Now what do you do?
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.400]   But it does show you how flexible
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.280]   past book system is.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.000]   Apps can deposit them directly from an iOS app.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.600]   You can have them as an email attachment.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.280]   A website can push them out.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.040]   So I hope this means that in the next three or four months,
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.360]   every single popular transaction that you make
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.920]   that involves an iPhone pass gets translated into a past book thing.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:44.560]   I made my first Starbucks purchase via a past book
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.240]   for the first time last week.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.040]   And man, did I feel like I was in 2012.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.960]   I loved that so much.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.280]   But bought an Amtrak ticket the other day,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.400]   was openly hostile when I found that the Amtrak app
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.840]   did not work with past book yet.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.400]   And I still had to do it the old-fashioned 2011.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.800]   They're the old-fashioned summer of 2012 way,
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:05.600]   which is actually open the Amtrak app
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.320]   to access my online ticket.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:09.200]   This is interesting.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.200]   They also have famous events, including,
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.800]   we were just talking about 2001,
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.600]   a space odyssey, the movie, the view of that,
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.880]   of Star Wars.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.280]   I remember going to see that May 25, 1977,
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.200]   but not at the man's Chinese theater.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.640]   The assassination of Lincoln, you can go to American's cousin.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.880]   That's not very hard ticket to get.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.840]   Scalper's booked that entire theater in like 10 seconds
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.760]   when that date got appeared.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.280]   So you add them through iCloud.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.440]   And I don't know what the barcode,
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.960]   I wonder what the barcode does on these.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.240]   Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.160]   My developer, Donald Burr, of Otaku,
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.480]   new podcast actually made me my own.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.960]   And I don't know what for either.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.960]   Oh, so that's how easy it is.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.000]   Would you like to be at the World Cup
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.440]   championship where England won in 1966?
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.000]   Or at center court at Wimbledon, 2008,
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.280]   federal and a doll.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.080]   That was a good one.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.240]   Classic concerts.
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.760]   Let's see what concerts we could go to.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:15.280]   Viva la France, Marie Antoinette.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.480]   Getting her head chopped off.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.960]   That's not a concert.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:22.400]   This is fun.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.080]   This is fun.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.600]   Anyway, just F-L-O-N solutions.com.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.640]   FlonSolutions.com.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.600]   Number one brand, according to Interbrand.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.800]   They look at all the top companies in the world
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.800]   based on a variety of things.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.800]   And Coca-Cola worldwide is the number one brand value,
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.520]   up 8%.
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.280]   But Apple, coming on strong,
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.600]   more than doubled its brand value from
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.640]   number eight last year to number two in 2012.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.480]   Coming on strong, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.200]   Apple computers, funny because they knocked IBM
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.240]   out of the number two spot.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.160]   Much must would make Steve very happy, I think.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.480]   I just find it amazing that IBM is still up there.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.920]   Like, you don't think about it there everywhere.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:12.000]   I mean, they still do a lot, but it just,
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.880]   the brand isn't as omnipresent as you would expect.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.760]   Like when you look at Apple and Google and Coca-Cola
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.200]   and Microsoft all around them,
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.360]   you don't just don't think of IBM that way.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.600]   The rest of the list, IBM, Google
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.920]   staying hovering at number four,
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.640]   Microsoft going from three to five,
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:34.320]   GE, McDonald's Intel, Samsung taking a big jump from 17 to number nine.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.160]   And then a bunch of companies.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:36.160]   How did they do this?
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.160]   So they call up people and say,
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.360]   "Have you heard of these companies?"
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.480]   And they say, "Yes or no?"
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.560]   No, I don't think this is a survey.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.840]   I think this is some sort of,
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:46.240]   it's based on fiscal performance
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.080]   and the premium that they could charge based on name alone.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.680]   The inner brand is a consulting company.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.280]   Who knows that, you know, you do these things for the press release, right?
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.560]   And they've done well.
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:46:59.280]   And they've done well.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.760]   And I am going to wrap it up today before we get to our picks of the week
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.040]   because we are running a little long.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.720]   We started late, but we also running long.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.880]   With this cute little,
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.880]   I don't understand the point of it from Inventica Solutions.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:19.280]   Created an HTML5 iPod.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.920]   So if we go to, let's see now, that's his web page.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:25.040]   Let me go back a little bit.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.520]   I accidentally played with this during Bert Monroe's speech at the Macintosh.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.400]   You're going to make music?
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:31.360]   There's blaring out.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.240]   I couldn't shut it up.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.120]   Oh, that's so funny.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:33.600]   Let me see.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.720]   View the demo.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.320]   It says CSS and HTML5 and the scroll wheel.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:39.600]   Works.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.680]   It's got playlists, not very elaborate ones.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.880]   And it'll actually play songs.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:49.920]   This is just like the first iPod.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.160]   ♪ Everything is new again ♪
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.360]   ♪ Walking with the permagrin head so high ♪
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.680]   I don't know what this group is, but I like it.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.960]   Permogrin.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.880]   I love the idea that because we're losing like so much of our culture because
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.960]   the iPod was such a transformative sort of thing.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.880]   But as soon as someone loses the last Firewire charger
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.600]   and the last instance of this, the battery gives out,
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.680]   no one will ever know what this was, what it was like to interact with us ever again.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.160]   I think that there should be interactive,
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.040]   similar of just about every other significant tech product that's out there.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.400]   So that 100 years from now, someone can actually operate an iPod and find out
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.480]   what the, why are primitive brains actually thought that it was a cool thing?
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.240]   I agree.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.120]   This is much more experiential than reading about it.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.320]   Just think of the museum in 100 years where they have like little displays of
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.520]   iPods where you can play with them.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.480]   They'll have 3D printers.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.600]   But they'll print them out.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.120]   I bet it will.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.760]   Sad, I still have my, but I broke it, putting Linux on it.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:52.560]   Aww, no, I have mine untouched.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.120]   I kept my money.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.480]   The original iPod.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.960]   It's in my special, lead-lined cupboard.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.400]   So that it will always be safe from a atomic attack.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.360]   It's a salt line in Utah.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:03.840]   It is.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:06.160]   Next to the Johnny Carson master tapes.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.280]   There's no humidity.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.520]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.040]   I would like to do, if we can, an iOS tip, a lot, mountain lion tip or a Mac OS 10 tip.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.040]   And Alison, I want to give you the chance to do a pick, if you wish.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.160]   We'll all do our picks too.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:20.240]   Absolutely.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.640]   But first, I got some really good news from audible.com.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.560]   You've heard us talk about audible.com.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:31.200]   And it is a great place for people who love to read.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.480]   People get mad at me when I say it's reading, but it's the same.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:37.600]   You would text, you would read if you read the book, but they read it to you.
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.320]   And I like that.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:44.160]   I like listening to books because I can then read my books at times when I wouldn't normally be
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.640]   able to, like at the gym on the Stairmaster, or when I'm commuting, driving the kids to school,
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.240]   when I'm cleaning the house.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:54.400]   You know, one of the reasons I got those Sonos speakers is so that I can have my audible book
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.240]   in every room in the house.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.560]   So as I do the chores, I do the laundry, I clean up, I make breakfast, whatever,
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.520]   I hear the book.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.920]   I'm constantly listening to something while I'm cleaning.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.120]   Constantly, I love it.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.600]   Sonos is a really good reason actually.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.440]   Audible is a good reason to get a Sonos system as expensive as it is.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.280]   I listen to music on my Sonos system too, but Audible is just fantastic.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.640]   Highly recommend you take a listen.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.360]   We're going to get you a free book in a second.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.120]   The usual offer audible.com/macbreak.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.160]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:26.880]   You'll get a credit.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.320]   That means you can get, you know, there are a few books that are multiple credits,
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.360]   like 0.05%, but most of them are a single credit.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:38.240]   I'm out of credits, I have to say, because I just bought,
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.120]   I ran out of credits and I bought cloud Atlas because I wanted to listen to it
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.160]   before the movie comes out.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:42.960]   I'm very into it.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.680]   I never liked to wait.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:44.240]   And that's one thing.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.080]   I like to listen to the audible book after the movie.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.160]   Oh, well, so the thing is, I don't want to ruin the movie.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.120]   I don't want to know what was missing.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:52.000]   What I want is to then to discover it like, oh, that's a good one.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:52.960]   That all makes sense.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.680]   Okay, that's a good argument.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.920]   So I always do it after the movie.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.920]   Otherwise, you watch the movie and you go,
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.920]   I cannot believe they didn't include this.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.920]   You know, why didn't they miss so much?
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.800]   I guess my attitude is, if I have a choice between spoiling the book
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.480]   and spoiling the movie, I'd rather spoil the movie.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:10.320]   Anyway, that's my recommendation.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.520]   It's really an interesting book.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.640]   They have to tell you upfront because cloud Atlas is a weird novel
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.680]   where one story ends abruptly and the next one begins and then they circle back.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:21.680]   And they warn you at the beginning.
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.360]   This is not, the audiobook is not broken.
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:26.400]   It will promise you.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.200]   Everything's normal.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.160]   You just keep listening.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.640]   What are you listening to right now?
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.760]   Alan?
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.240]   Andy?
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:36.560]   Well, my recommendation this week is something that I've owned in multiple formats.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.360]   It is the new improved Bob and Ray book.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.880]   Oh, I got to get this.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.400]   Bob and Ray, they were a New England radio comedy team that went national
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.840]   from the 50s and the 60s.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.920]   Their career went well into the 70s.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:53.520]   And their Bob Elliott is the father of Chris Elliott.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.600]   And that gives you some idea of where Chris Elliott got his weird oblique sense of humor from.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:07.040]   All I can tell you is that I recommend their comedy so highly because it's that magical form
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:10.400]   of comedy where there's no set up punchline, set up punchline, set up punchline.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.760]   It's not like Monty Python where they're doing these absurd things.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:17.760]   They just keep ratching it up, the absurdity more and more and more.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:24.240]   It's two like middle aged guys having conversations that you would hear on any radio station
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.880]   in the 50s and 60s.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.400]   Interview, man in the street interviews, just coverage of local events ads.
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:32.960]   None of it is.
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:42.640]   I don't know why they actually published this as a real book because this version of it is Bob
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.080]   and Ray and before a live audience performing all this material.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.080]   In the book, you read their sketches and you say, why is this?
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.000]   Why would anybody consider this funny?
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.200]   Because this is just like a transcript.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.920]   It seems like a transcript of a plain conversation that you might have heard like five times over
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.120]   the course of a month of you just waiting the subway long enough.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:08.640]   When you hear it performed, it's just that that 10 degrees out of phase with reality
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:14.000]   that just you don't know why you're finding this hysterically funny, but it is hysterically funny.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.960]   So I am recommending it even though it's only two hours and 25 minutes long.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:20.080]   I know normally I'd like to recommend that you fear and get your free books,
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:24.080]   stick it to the man, find the 26 hour, the 28 hour, the 32 hour book.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.680]   This is where we make it all up.
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.840]   I find them hysterically funny.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:30.400]   I'm a big Bob and Ray fan.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.600]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.320]   Let me see if this is.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.320]   Psychogenically impossible to be thrown by a question.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.760]   That's right.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.200]   Do I make myself conspicuous?
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.800]   Yes, but then you always do.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.840]   So it's really our fault when inviting you back.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:48.560]   All we can do now is hope that you won't be thrown by any of this week's questions.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.560]   And our first letter to the word, Richard, comes from a woman in Ohio.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.240]   It's just got to listen.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:57.760]   You could search probably for Bob and Ray and find some on the internet.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.480]   They are just huge inspirations for me.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.600]   And I agree.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:05.920]   I have like a couple hundred hours worth of Bob and Ray in my library.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:09.520]   And it's like, I just, I don't know why this is so funny.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:14.640]   They're just, this is a guy interviewing a truck driver whose truck got stuck in an overpass.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.320]   Nothing particularly weird happened, but it's just so hysterical.
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.480]   Now I have to tell you, there is something special on this particular audible offer today.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.880]   We have another free book.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:26.720]   You don't even have to be a member.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.080]   I think audible wanted just to give you all a chance to hear it.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.440]   Not only a great book, but it's a novella.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.000]   It's, you know, it's two hours and eight minutes.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.320]   So it's not going to, you know, take up a huge amount of your time.
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.480]   But it's a fantasy book.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:43.120]   They know that you guys like sci-fi and fantasy.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.480]   And they're offering this completely free no strings attached.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.760]   You don't have to be a member.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.640]   You don't have to sign up.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.360]   It's Brandon Sanderson's Legion.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:52.880]   I'll play a little bit of this for you.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.320]   All the audible books have samples.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.760]   Stephen Leeds.
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.600]   And I am perfectly sane.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.840]   My hallucinations, however, are all quite mad.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:04.480]   Stephen Leeds is Legion.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.080]   His unique mental condition lets him create a multitude of personae,
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.320]   hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.960]   This is where audiobooks leap into life.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.640]   This is going to come alive in your mind in a way.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.400]   It could never do so in a movie theater.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.760]   This is free right now, regardless of our other offer,
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:26.320]   regardless of whether you're a member, you do not have to join.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:33.360]   Just go to audible.com/sanderson, S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.320]   No trial or credit card required for this free book.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.880]   I think that they just love Brandon Sanderson.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.920]   They want to turn you on to them.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:41.360]   I had not listened to any of this stuff,
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.960]   so I'm going to download this right now, because it's completely free.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:48.000]   And by the way, it's also a demo of Whisper Sync.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.400]   This is a Whisper Sync for Voice Ready book.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.000]   So if you get the Kindle book for $2.99 from Amazon,
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.240]   then you can have the book in the reader and listen to the book and go back and forth.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:00.960]   It's really cool.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.360]   audible.com/sanderson for that completely free novella.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:10.880]   And then join the goal plan, book a month, first month's free, first book's free,
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.800]   at audible.com/macbreak.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.840]   So there's two different ways to play our game.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.640]   Thank you, audible.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:17.760]   That's a nice offer.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.680]   audible.com/sanderson.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:23.760]   Let us get, do you want to do an iOS tip?
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:23.920]   Sure.
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.120]   Something that can help us.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:25.680]   I got a couple.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.240]   All right.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:31.520]   So I got two mail tips that were sent in by my Twitter followers.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.600]   I mean, sometimes in the morning, I say, "Hey, I'm working on this.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:34.320]   You got any good ideas?"
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.600]   And there were some good ones that I don't think we've covered.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.520]   So one is this came in from Seamus Laverie in Brussels.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:43.840]   Wow.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.120]   And if you go, a lot of times it's hard to find the draft folder quickly.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:52.960]   You wrote something and then you accidentally put it in the draft and now you can't find it.
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.760]   Turns out if you go to your compose and you hold it down,
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.040]   just keep on holding it down.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.320]   All your drafts pop right up.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.520]   You see, that's I don't know how you discover that.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.080]   That's awesome.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:05.040]   I don't know how you discover it as you tell your Twitter followers
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.640]   that you're thinking that you need to have a good tip and then they give you a great one.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.800]   So press and hold the compose button.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:11.920]   And pop up.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:12.960]   And drafts show up.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.000]   And all your drafts show up.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:14.480]   That is cool.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:17.520]   Let me do that again for I don't have any drafts, but if I did, it would do it.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.120]   So this is the compose button.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.600]   It's that little square with the pen and you press and hold it.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.760]   You got to make sure.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:24.160]   Whoops.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.200]   Now that's the composer doing.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.080]   I got to hold it a little longer.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:26.880]   There you go.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.000]   And here's your drafts.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.520]   If I had drafts, it would be there.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.360]   But that's something that's awesome.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:36.960]   And while you're doing that, if you want to insert a photo or video,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.880]   when you hold down, you can hold down and it says select, select, select all paste,
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.440]   hit the little arrow and it says insert, photo, or video.
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:44.080]   Oh, oh.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:45.680]   Oh, wait, where was that?
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.080]   Where was that?
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.200]   So you're composing a message and you will.
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.240]   See, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.200]   Composing a message and if you press and hold, it says select all.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.960]   You're like, OK, but how do I get my photo in there?
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.000]   And there's an arrow there.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:54.400]   Whoops.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.920]   This is where my big fat fingers are always going to get in the way.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:58.400]   Hold down.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.240]   And then there's an arrow.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.560]   Alex, that was worth how annoying this was to be on today.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.080]   I mean, I really didn't want to do it, but that was--
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:04.880]   There we go.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.240]   Insert photo or video.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.720]   And then that'll let you insert something from your eye photo.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.920]   So it is two little male tips.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:16.000]   And that one was sent Tom Hora at Green Bay.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.760]   That was his suggestion.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.040]   So thanks, Tom.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:19.920]   Thanks, Seamus.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:21.360]   That's awesome.
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.160]   Yeah, it was--
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.880]   And I just-- I mean, I love the--
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.720]   I mean, I got like 50 of them.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.640]   So I'm going to try to collect them all today because it's great to get everybody's input.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.760]   So everybody cool.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.640]   By the way--
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.520]   Really good.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.200]   Do we have a name for the booger?
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.800]   You know, when you refresh your mail, that thing?
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.120]   I know.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.000]   What is that?
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:40.080]   What is that?
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.440]   The only app that does this?
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.480]   It's the little--
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.360]   It's called the booger.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.880]   It's the little stretchy thing.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:45.360]   Snap.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.560]   Yep.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.920]   That's--
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.320]   As far as--
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.520]   This is new to iOS 6.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.440]   And as far as I know, this is the only app that uses it
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.280]   and probably Apple is even packaged.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:53.840]   I think it's that.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:54.880]   I do think it's system-wide.
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:55.920]   Is it system-wide?
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.400]   It's absolutely patented.
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:59.520]   It pops up in other apps too, like podcasts.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.520]   And Samsung don't even--
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.840]   Don't ever do the booger.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:04.560]   Samsung.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.840]   Samsung is saying, you know what?
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.200]   I think you can have this as it.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.200]   We respect your mobile company too much.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:12.320]   Wow.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.520]   So it works in podcasts?
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.040]   Wow.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:16.240]   It's part-- yeah, there's--
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.480]   In iOS 6, that's a new behavior that you can put into your scrolling list view.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:23.360]   A pull to refresh is something you can just simply add to whatever app you're doing.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:24.400]   I should try this.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:28.960]   Of course, tap bots probably doesn't use it because they go their own way.
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:31.200]   Let me just try it.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.840]   See, if this were Android's own,
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:34.240]   would it--
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.480]   --put in an app that modifies the behavior.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.240]   So when you do the pull to refresh, it goes--
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.000]   Andy Inaco, you got a lion or an OS 10 or a mountain lion tip for us?
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.200]   I'm stealing them all from my talk on the Insight Cruises Mac Mini.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:51.760]   I got a quick one.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:55.520]   This one is specifically a tip for Mac OS pages.
[01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:02.160]   And you know that you've tapped the inspector button to get the inspector to modify font size,
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.280]   frames, sizes, tables, charts, things like that.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.640]   But maybe you actually are doing the sort of thing where you would like to have two or three or more
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:16.240]   inspectors so that you can always have a font panel, but you also want to have
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:17.920]   another panel so you can set borders.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.320]   What I did not know, despite being a page user for many years, is that if you option click
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:25.760]   on another one of those tabs, once you have the inspector open,
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:31.680]   it will open another instance of the inspector window pointing to whatever tab that you just left.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:35.680]   So we can make our screen as cluttered as we do with the Microsoft Word.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.920]   Well, unfortunately, hopefully the next edition you can actually put all--
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:43.120]   have like 19 ribbons over the top of the screen.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:47.040]   You still have to actually just have them outside of the window.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:51.120]   But it is a way to have more than one bank of settings available in this.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.000]   Look at this.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.800]   You can do them all.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.480]   This is option click.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.120]   Again, discoverability is tough.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:00.000]   But once you know it, that's a very handy tool.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:00.880]   Look at that.
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:02.080]   I wrote that one down.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.680]   See?
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.800]   See, see, see, see what I'm saying?
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.480]   That's in pages.
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.680]   Option click the inspector tools to kind of tear them off as a new page.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:15.120]   Alison, would you like to give us a pick this week?
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:15.680]   I would.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:19.920]   Can I actually give you-- if I go fast enough, give you an iOS and a Mac?
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:20.800]   Absolutely.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.240]   So I like to start with a problem to be solved.
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:28.400]   A lot of apps and websites will tell you what time it is in another time zone.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.200]   But what they never tell you is what time will it be at a specific time in your time zone.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   So there's an app called TimeScroller.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.480]   It's an iOS app.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.440]   It's a couple of bucks.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.880]   I forget how much it is.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.800]   And it's got a little scroller thing.
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:44.480]   You set up the cities you care about and you scroll this little thing until it shows you
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.240]   what time it is in your time zone.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:49.040]   And then it tells you what time will it be for Don McAllister.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:49.920]   Oh, I like that.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:50.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.040]   And that's not at all common.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.360]   And it works really well.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.000]   It's also a dashboard app on the Mac that's actually free.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:58.960]   And I use it all the time.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.600]   You can name them.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:02.160]   So I have one that says Don and Bart.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.880]   And that's England and Ireland's time zone, that kind of thing.
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:06.160]   That's clever.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:07.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:08.800]   I really like it.
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.720]   It's one of my favorite things.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:11.840]   I use it all the time.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.040]   So I don't have to think it up.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:17.360]   The other one is for the Mac.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:22.880]   Another problem I have is that I put my Mac to sleep and then I yank out my iPod.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.360]   And I forget to eject it first.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.560]   So this one is called Jettison.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.680]   It's a menu bar app.
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:32.640]   And it'll allow you to do a bunch of different things.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.600]   You can put your Mac to sleep.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.600]   You can eject iPods and other devices, your backup drive, that kind of thing.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.360]   Or you can eject and sleep.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:47.680]   So it's one stop shopping basically to kill the whole thing when you want to run out.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.640]   Jettison, is it free?
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.720]   I think it is free.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.600]   No, no, no.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:51.920]   I'm sorry.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.440]   It's in the Mac App Store for $2.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.080]   $2.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:54.560]   $2.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.120]   All right.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.440]   And the other is a dashboard.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.720]   It's the first time I've ever talked about dashboards ever.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.840]   Well, it's the one thing I use as a dashboard widget, I guess.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:06.320]   It's a perfect use for the dashboard, actually.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:06.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.480]   I think so.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.080]   And like I said, it's an iPhone.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.480]   It's cooler on the iPhone.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.360]   You can actually tell it once you pick a time,
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.400]   you can tell it to send everybody an email that's on your list.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.400]   And it shows them what time it is in their time zone.
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:22.960]   Oh, I like that.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.400]   I don't ever use that, but it's Neo.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.520]   Did you know, Don, that it's 9am?
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:32.480]   Hey, Alex, I know this isn't your pick, but can you hand me that elemental?
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.000]   I can try to pick it up.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:34.480]   I'm not going to be able to.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:34.960]   It's pretty heavy.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.080]   This is what we want to buy.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.000]   Right now, the way we stream, we send streams out to you stream,
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:47.040]   we send a couple to you stream to just the TV to bit gravity, to flow soft media.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.920]   So we send them out to a variety of sources and then they send it out to you.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.440]   But we're doing it in a Cluji way.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.800]   We run a kind of a wirecast and a bunch of scripts.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:56.720]   And by the way, as a note, I mean, oh, sorry.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.440]   We use, we use Wirecast a lot for a lot of different things.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.680]   It's cool that it's not built for 24 hours.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:02.800]   24 hours streaming.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:06.560]   So there's a machine that actually Colleen's been telling us we should buy.
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.600]   For years.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.400]   She told me that too.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.440]   And then I bought one.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.560]   But then I bought more.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.360]   Until I found out how much it was, how much is this thing?
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:17.040]   This is like 25.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.000]   What, how much is it Colleen?
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:18.960]   17.
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.520]   17,000 pounds.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.880]   It depends on your configuration.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.560]   But this does it all.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:23.840]   It's all it's called elemental.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.600]   It's hardware device only, right?
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.360]   Yeah, this is a hardware encoder.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.240]   And we wanted one of these and this would let us be much more reliable in terms of our streams.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.320]   Yeah, I think, and they come in a couple of configurations.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:40.160]   This one is the one that I, that we use on site, on when we do streams on, on, on site.
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:41.040]   It's more portable.
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.000]   More portable.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.120]   More portable.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.480]   Just, you can tell it's portable because it has a handle.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:47.680]   See it's got handles.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.520]   The other one, and we've shipped the other one.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:53.760]   We have one in our, in our Co-Lo, in our data center that has, that's, that's a rack mount.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.960]   And it's really long.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:56.240]   Yeah, that's probably the one we would get.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.040]   Sounds like a jet engine.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.080]   This one's also real quiet.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.360]   This is the manual model.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.400]   Yes.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:00.960]   Yes.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.520]   Yes.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:01.760]   So.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.120]   And it's pretty, when it's actually on, there's like pretty little.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.920]   You don't want to sell that used to us to you, but I'm still using it.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.920]   So what, you know what we did, and I think this is kind of fun.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.320]   We, we decided to sell it.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.600]   We didn't really bill it this way.
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:16.560]   I should have thought of this.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.040]   I've always thought of it as the, we're raising money for the elemental t-shirt.
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:29.040]   And if you go to T-E-E-S-P-R-I-N-G tspring.com/twid, you can see it.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.240]   It's $20 and there are three days of five hours left.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:35.440]   And the good news is we've sold over 2000, which I think means that we've made enough
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:36.400]   money to buy an elemental.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.400]   So thank you everybody.
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:42.000]   They will be shipped as soon as the three days expire, as soon as everybody orders.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.560]   It's a one time only once we do that press run.
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.120]   It's gone.
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:50.480]   It's a nice t-shirt you get to choose American apparel or fruit of the loom.
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:51.760]   So it's good quality.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:56.240]   $20 and you'll, you can, you can wear that shirt with pride and say we helped
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.320]   Twit improve the quality of their stream.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.640]   So there you go.
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:03.520]   Tspring.com/twit.
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.800]   Now you could do a real pick.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.680]   So I am,
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:12.720]   so my pick for today is Frankenwini.
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:14.080]   The movie.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:14.080]   The movie.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.520]   No, but you have little kids.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.120]   I have no reason to see Frankenwini.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:18.560]   I do think it's about it.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:23.280]   So here's the funny thing is I saw the, oh, it's a book.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:23.920]   This is the iBook.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:26.880]   So is it based on the movie or is the movie based on the movie?
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.200]   Okay.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.760]   So no, this is the kind of stop action movie.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:33.440]   Yeah, what I wanted to show was this is the beginning of iBook starting to come to life.
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:38.080]   So like click on that, click on that over there, click on that, and then click and drag.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.080]   That's one of the characters.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:43.600]   So this is the 3D rendering of one of the characters.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:44.000]   Exactly.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.320]   And then you can see a kid could see the sketch.
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:46.720]   Right.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:49.040]   And then they could go from the sketch to the screen.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.960]   Now Malekai's probably too little for someone.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:51.520]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:52.880]   He just comes through this.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.000]   He just, you know, like, you know, the authors of the swap.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:56.240]   Yeah.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:58.880]   I mean, he's, yeah, he, uh, and Malekai put this together.
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:01.520]   No, no, um, uh, this is cool.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:06.000]   No, but the thing is, is I think this is, I really feel like, um, this is a great example
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.280]   of the future of books, you know, kind of multimedia.
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:09.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:12.880]   I mean, there's, there's not a ton of text there is, but there's, there's a lot of movies.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:14.720]   There is some text that ties everything together.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.880]   There's a, and if you go earlier, there's some movies that, you know, you get to see like the
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:19.600]   development of it.
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:21.040]   So this is Sparky the Dog.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.560]   And these are actual Macettes.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:28.640]   You can't maybe tell, but that's a photograph of the Macettes that are used for the animation.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:34.080]   And then here's the 3D animation of Sparky that, or the 3D rendering, I should say, of Sparky the Dog.
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:38.960]   And there are, and earlier on, I think that if you go, if you go back to some of the earlier chapters,
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:43.200]   there are movies that show you like what the storyboard looked like versus what the final look like,
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.520]   what the, you know, what the, I think right there, try that.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:48.720]   Storyboard animatic at final footage video.
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:49.280]   Wow.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.120]   So here's the animatic, you know, so,
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:52.080]   Yeah, audio in here.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:55.040]   I think I turned it down, but if you,
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:03.200]   So you get to see the movie and then the animatic, which is kind of the simple cartoon version
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:03.600]   Right.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:04.640]   that they use for shooting.
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:06.000]   Script.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.840]   Wow.
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:12.080]   So you would want to, because it's how they make these things, you know.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:12.320]   Right.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.640]   And I think that this is a really great, I mean, this is a lot of kids would love this.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.000]   Right. And what you're really seeing here is what is the iBook starting to live up to its,
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.440]   the iBook author starting to live up to its, its capabilities, which is a book that is easy to
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:33.360]   browse through lightly, but there's lots of raffles, right, interesting ones where if you're
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:36.320]   interested in something, and I think, because I think that is always the challenge with books is
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:40.080]   that there's like, what do you cover? So cover the whole thing. And then if I'm really interested
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:44.240]   in that next section, I can dig deeper into it. And, and I think that that's something very
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.040]   hard to do in a traditional book. And I think that this is, this is still just a baby step in my,
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.680]   in my opinion, of where books are going to be going. But I think that this is a great example of
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:58.480]   what's possible and where this is a promotion, a promotional piece.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.360]   So it's free?
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.000]   No, it's not free, but I mean, it's, I don't know how much it is.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.160]   I was, I download a lot of iBooks because we're doing a lot of development.
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:11.120]   And this is just one of the shouldn't have to ask the ones that I, I mean, all of these iBooks
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.120]   are really inexpensive so far anyway. I'm not buying the textbooks.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.920]   This is a Tim Burton movie, which, so the preview is built in.
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:21.360]   I've heard some very good things. It really shouldn't charge you since they have an ad for the movie.
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.400]   I just, but I can't wait to have one screw in the things about this movie, actually.
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.920]   My, it was funny because I thought my son, who's four, I thought he'd be too young for it for a Tim
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.880]   Burton movie, but all he talks about is wanting to go. So we'll see how this goes.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:36.160]   Can we have all night going?
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.440]   No, no, it's really not.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.000]   There's the armature inside the puppet so that they can bend it and it'll hold its position because
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.800]   it's a soft look at that. This is very cool.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:49.600]   But I think this is, this is the beginning of these books. I think we're going to look back on
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.320]   books like this as some of the first ones that did this, that I mean, when you saw the textbooks,
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.800]   you were like, you know, like that's, that's fine. But when you're starting to see how they're
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.800]   adding all these pieces and adding that interactivity, this is the beginning of the end of the traditional
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:08.160]   book. I mean, this is, this is where we look back five years from now or 10 years from now,
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.880]   and we can't imagine opening a paper book, except for old people, you know, I mean, you know, like,
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.000]   but my kids are never going to never be able to imagine.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.520]   Yes. Oh, people like me.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.760]   But I mean, like my kids will never, there was a linear narrative in which there was a coherent
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.720]   story with the beginning and the middle and end that we didn't have to.
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.920]   Yes. We couldn't abort at any moment where we'd got bored. Oh, what puny braids we had.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:33.600]   Yes. Yes. You know, it's managed six different possibilities at one time.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:38.800]   Oh, that's neat. Are the other credit collage. One of the things that's neat about Frankenwini
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:44.480]   was this Tim Burton made this as a dragon man like 20 years ago, right? Do you drag him down?
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:51.360]   You know what? A kid could figure this out. Not humans, not me. Create your collage now.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:54.640]   Oh, here we go. I had to press the button that said to do it. Now drags.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:11:00.240]   Yeah, like maybe. Okay, well, there we go. This is fun.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:06.400]   This stuff to be like a kid and try stuff. So, Frankenwini on the iPad.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.200]   Yeah. And it's in the iBook store or is it?
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.440]   It's in the, you can find it in the App Store.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:16.400]   Okay. We're in the iTunes and iTunes and you also can find it on the iBook store in your
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:23.040]   on your iPad. And as I said, especially if there's a lot of people that I get emails from that are
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:26.320]   listening to, you know, that are thinking about iBooks, especially if you're thinking about
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.160]   construction of an iBook. This is probably one of the better ones that I've seen. Good.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:33.280]   Frankenwini. Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.160]   I've got a good one. I readjusted things so you could actually see the screen a little bit better.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:44.720]   It's an iPad app called Gritteter. Here we have a kind of a dull like gray sky picture of the flags
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.440]   outside the Boston Public Library that I shot the other day. And of course it needs some help,
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.400]   but normally in a photo editor, you have to sort of march your way through that process of,
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.480]   okay, well, what if I make it a little bit brighter? Okay. Well, maybe if I make it a little bit more
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.560]   shadow contrast, well, what if I do this? Gritteter, as the name implies, will take whatever picture
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:11.440]   that you've got in the film in your camera roll and do this to it. Whoa. It will show you every
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:17.760]   single option available to you. And it's like an iTest more than anything else. So it's a grid
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:22.400]   with all the different filters applied of the image. Not well, see, there's a logic to it,
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:30.080]   where the way it's set up right now, all the thumbnails above this are progressively brighter.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:37.760]   When you go above the center image, it's getting progressively more contrasty. When you go below
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.800]   it, it's getting progressively more vibrant. When you go this way, it's getting progressively brighter,
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:48.240]   this way, it's getting progressively darker. So as you can imagine, as you scroll around,
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.040]   you can see, well, actually, the right, the nice one is the one where it's much brighter and a
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:58.160]   little bit more contrasty. So if you tap on this one, it will then show you what that looks like.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:03.360]   There's a checkbox on the bottom. So if I tap this checkbox, watch what happens. Now that becomes
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:09.920]   the new default image. And now it's loading in. Okay, now do you want it to be up is sharper,
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:15.120]   down is shadow contrast. This way is makes it a little bit more gloomy. This way makes it
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.800]   a little bit more desaturated. And once again, you scroll around looking for the one that you like
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:26.400]   the best. How about this one over here? Yeah, that looks nice. And so there are a whole bunch
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.600]   of different filters like that. And as you march your way through all of them, it will keep loading
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:37.760]   in like changing what each axis does. And letting you combine these effects in really, really cool
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:43.520]   ways. Right now it seems chosen. If you go down below, you'll suddenly make it black and white.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.320]   Now here you're making color changes to the color balance of it.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.840]   You can also, if you want to, if you want a little bit more control, like let's say, I know I don't
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:00.080]   want to make this 1970s. So if I tap on that, if I tap on this marker here, now it brings up like
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:06.560]   an actual panel of filters. So I can decide, no, no, no, let me see, I want this to be more contrasty.
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.560]   So now changes it so that now moving to this way makes things more contrasty.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.360]   So as you can imagine, it's just a really easy way to start with an image that you don't know
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:20.800]   what's wrong with it, but you know it needs some fixing. And just through letting it do things,
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:26.160]   just walking you through better like this, or better like this. Would you like brightness plus
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:31.120]   contrast? Would you like contrast plus a little bit more saturation? And by the time you go through
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.360]   about two or three steps of these, you wind up with something very, very, very close to what
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:40.800]   you would have wanted this photo to be like, or something you would never have imagined had you
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:46.800]   not seen a sample of this in front of your eyes. So it's a brand new app. It's just 99 cents.
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:53.920]   They're going to raise the price at some point. And it's boy, I would like to think that I am
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.760]   sophisticated enough, a photo editor to not require something as easy as this. But I require
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.760]   something as easy as this. This is this is the sort of thing that you could you couldn't imagine this
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:09.040]   app ever existing outside of the iPad, even though the basic concept, I suppose you could even do
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:14.400]   it as a desktop app. But man, this is this really shows off the advantages of having a big touchscreen
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:21.440]   device. Very cool. How much again? 99 cents? 99 frickin cents. That's a good deal.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.880]   Not even an entire dollar. I'm sorry, I was a little distracted. I'm squishing zombies. I hope
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:34.080]   this Halloween after all. Maybe it's good. Maybe it's good that Neil did not invite me to speak.
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:37.840]   If I can captivate my audience such that distract them from a game for five minutes.
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:45.760]   So this is a new newish game. You've played Farmville, right? You've played We Rule, right?
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.240]   Well, how would you like the Simpsons to get into Farmville and we rule? I maybe even have some
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:56.560]   zombies. I'm supposed to be able to tap them. Oh, man, they've zombified everybody. Even Lisa's a
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:04.640]   zombie now. This is kind of a we rule with all the Simpsons characters in it. I don't know. Are
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:10.400]   you hearing the audio? Oh, I know what I need to probably do is turn the audio on. Yeah, there we go.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:16.400]   It's called the Simpsons Tapped Out, available for iPhone and iPad. And it's free, by the way,
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:24.240]   which has a certain appeal to people like me. I know, I know, you probably say, I finally got
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:29.360]   We Rule and Farmville out of my system. I don't need another game to it. But this one has the
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:35.840]   Simpsons in it, right? You've got Opu. You could build a parking lot for the Quickie Mart. Let's do
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:41.600]   it. We'll drag it right here. Here we go. Let's put it right in front of the Quickie Mart. That's
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:47.600]   where a parking lot belongs. And I'll collect points. Opu says, what is this? The Quickie Mart
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:54.080]   is not supposed to have a lawn. Where is the comforting pavement? Now I could place pavement
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:58.640]   everywhere. Pave Paradise is the name of it. That's why I like this. It's got the simple
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:06.560]   humor of the Simpsons. I'm going to place pavement all over the place. And I'll just drag it around
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:12.800]   and we'll have pavement everywhere. It's a lot of fun. And it's free. Did I say free? Not Opu.
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.800]   Opu. Come on. You can actually make Opu pray to Ganesh, which is kind of fun.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:23.120]   I'm sure that's done in a very tasteful way. Oh, it is. It's a Simpsons. Of course it is.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:28.320]   So we build, "Cly, this is farm. He's a slack jod yoker. Yokele. Oh, I'm too poor to build
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:32.880]   a slack jod yokele farm. Maybe I'll build Frank's lab instead."
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:39.280]   Need more donuts. By the way, donuts are the currency of this electronic arts game because
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:44.960]   after all the Simpsons like donuts. And you can incidentally go to other Springfield's. Oops.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:52.160]   Let's cancel that. I can't go to other Springfield's and see what they've been doing. And you have
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:58.320]   friends. If anybody wants to be my friend and kill with you and kill with me, that would be.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.080]   Well, no. Zombies are just to the end of the month. Oh, this is the Halloween feature.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:07.120]   Right. This is not a Halloween game. This is a game you'll want to be playing all year long.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:14.480]   For free. Well, you know how they get you. You might want more donuts to speed things up, right?
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:18.160]   Right. Actually, there's the funny plot of this and it has a nice little cutscene at the
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:23.600]   beginning is that Homer blows up all of Springfield by playing farmville and being inattentive
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.720]   to the nuclear plant. So you have to rebuild it from screen. I don't think they really allowed
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:35.360]   iPads and nuclear plants. I certainly hope not. All right. Have we got picks from everybody here?
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.720]   I think we have. Have we covered all the stories? Have we said anything about the Macintosh?
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:46.080]   Some. There you go. I definitely remember distinctly having heard that bird in some sequence.
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:52.880]   I think we can put our iPads away for another day. Anybody got an invite to an iPad event?
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:19:01.840]   Mueller? Anybody? Nobody? No, buddy. No, buddy at all. That Simpson's game is very addictive.
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:06.960]   In fact, I played it throughout most of the show and unfortunately, I tried not to talk about it.
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:13.680]   Well, I just was trying to level up. I wanted the zombies. A lot of dead time there.
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:21.120]   Thank you all for being here. You can follow Alison on the Twitter at pod feet.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.720]   That's right. I don't know what it means, but that's her handle.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:30.720]   It's better not to ask on that one. I don't want to know. And of course, she is on pod feet.com.
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:36.560]   That's where no silica cast live. Good job. Donald Burr would kill me if I didn't mention that he
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:41.920]   wrote an app for. Oh, that's hard to do. An app for the no silica cast. So you can watch my live
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:46.720]   show on Sunday nights at five o'clock. You can be in the chat room and play with the app. He'd
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:51.280]   killed me if I hadn't made that plug for him. Thank you for not doing that show during twit,
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:55.600]   by the way. Yeah. Well, I might have chosen my time separately and I was really glad when the
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:00.240]   metric weekly guys changed set their time to not be during mine. Yeah, I didn't want to take
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:05.840]   your audience. Leo, I know, I know. And that's good. We can share you and I. We shall share, shall we?
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:09.840]   We'll be very. I think it's I think it's good if we can all share. That's nice that way.
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.480]   Alex Lindsey is at the pixel core and you'll be reopening for membership any day now soon soon.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:19.360]   Well, things are actually getting where we have we have better staff in, you know, in place and
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:25.040]   I'm going to start traveling like crazy, but travel like crazy. A lot of business. And are you
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.400]   leaving town again or are we? Yes. Yes. Next week I'm in Phoenix in New York and
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:36.480]   I'll be gone for two weeks. All right. So I'm in Phoenix, New York and then Barcelona, then London,
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:40.560]   and I love Barcelona. And I love London. We're launching. So one of the things we'll be doing is
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:46.560]   we'll be launching our school in Rwanda at the end of this month. So I'll be in Kigali. So hopefully
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:50.720]   you will. Wow. Yeah. So we're excited about that. And can you join us from Kilgolly? I'm going to try.
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:55.680]   I don't know if I'll be there. But I should definitely we could
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:00.720]   maybe do to it from there. I'll be there on Sunday. That'd be great to you. Okay. Okay. Let me
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:04.400]   see if I can get up. We have five megabits up and down at the school. So let me see if I can
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.040]   want to test it. That should be enough. Yep. And we want to thank Andy and not
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:14.720]   Kofar being here as always a true stalwart of the Mac break weekly crew. We can work in some kind.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:18.400]   In fact, I think you're going to be holding down the fort when I'm in Australia.
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:23.280]   I'll be looking forward to it. I'll be assembling my usual cracks team of people that I know extremely
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:28.800]   well as opposed to strangers. I have very Sheldon esque in that aspect. People love it when you host
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:32.800]   the show because it really you do you do that exactly. And it's kind of it's a really nice change.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:38.240]   So I can't wait. I'll be listening after the fact with my minimal bandwidth in the middle of the ocean.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:44.000]   We'll try not. I'll tell the people like on the show just try not to move very much.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.360]   Because we need we need to compress the stream as tightly as possible so that people on the cruise
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:55.040]   ship can again get good bandwidth and actually watch it. Daddy, why does Andy look like he's in
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:22:00.640]   Grittator right now? It'll be the clutch cargo version of the podcast where really all you will
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:04.320]   see is some moving lips and everything else will be completely the same. That's good.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:09.840]   That works by the way. Just keep that up. Am I in like 4k HD right now?
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:13.280]   Yeah, you're much better. I'll be able to just we'll do the whole show that way.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:18.720]   Nobody will do anything but move their lips from now on. That way the compression algorithm will
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:25.760]   work better. Oh, I move my eyebrows bad choice. Damn it. Also, I also won't cut ever.
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:30.240]   Yeah, never cut because cutting of course ruins everything with all the key frames have to be
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:34.960]   thrown at. Start all over again. That's Chad Johnson. Our producer does such a great job of
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:38.960]   putting this show together each and every week. Thank you for being here. Chad, no problem.
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:43.360]   Don't forget we got iPad today on Thursdays, 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern. If you're interested in the
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:51.440]   iOS universe and Sarah now does i5 for the iPhone Mondays at 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern time 1800
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:56.240]   UTC. So we've got the iPhone, the iPad and Mac break weekly. We I think we've got this one covered.
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:02.000]   I think so on the Twit Network. You can watch our show every Tuesday 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.960]   1800 UTC. If you don't get to see the show live and as you can see, we use the chat room heavily.
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:12.240]   So that's why live is good for us. But don't worry. We've got on demand audio and video
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:19.120]   available at our website, twit.tv/mbw. Thank you all for joining us.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:23.040]   A Baron in the chat room says you should start an iPad mini show now.
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:29.200]   Ah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for joining us, Chad Room. Thank you for joining us. Everybody
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.720]   watching at home will see you next week. Now get back to work. Break time's over.
