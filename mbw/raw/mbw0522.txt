[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   It's time for Mac break weekly.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.520]   The last episode before Apple's big announcement.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.120]   Yes, the invitations went out.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840]   We'll talk about what that picture with the dots actually
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.560]   means and why it might be very good news for camera buffs.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.600]   Renee Richie will talk about the iPhone and its features,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400]   including its lack of a headphone jack will speculate
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.440]   on what that could mean and how Apple could sell it.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.880]   A whole lot coming up with Renee Richie, Andy,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800]   and not going to be Mac break weekly is next.

[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   And here they are, my good friends,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360]   my buddies from the Mac break weekly team on the left,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   wearing the blue trunks, Andy and not
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.560]   cove from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.080]   I actually don't know what color trunks are wearing today.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.760]   They're kind of black.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.720]   They're look.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   They're whatever perspiration color is.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   Because I was--
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.200]   Does that look--
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Is it hot?
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680]   Yeah, a bit of a heat wave right now,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   also exasperated by the fact that I went on a bike ride
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.360]   and decided to work at Starbucks until about 30 minutes ago.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.240]   And so there had to be a certain change in an attire.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.920]   I hear it's a good thing to work at Starbucks these days.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.760]   It pays good.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.960]   They give you benefits.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   So I hope you enjoyed that brief stint.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.760]   All the straws you can take.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.800]   I'm making a concerted partition in my bedroom fort.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.760]   It's almost like having a whole separate room.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.640]   On my right, Renee Ritchie from the beautiful town
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.960]   of Montreal, Canada.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.760]   He's also at imore.com.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   Guess somebody's coming to San Francisco in a week.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.760]   I can't believe it's next week.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   I just-- I need more time.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.360]   It's not enough time.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.400]   I feel like Bartlett, when he didn't realize he was president,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520]   really didn't want to accept it.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   Why are all these iPhones in my house?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.680]   Oh, Lord.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.560]   The invite, do you want to tell us what it looked like?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.800]   Because Andy and I haven't seen it yet.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.320]   What is that?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.640]   Sure.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.360]   What are those dots?
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.480]   That's Boca, right?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.280]   So it's an Apple logo, but it's composed of multicolored lights.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   And they all have a very heavy bokeh effect.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.360]   And it says, "See you on the seventh."
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.960]   Oh, gosh.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   I didn't recognize it.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.440]   So that's the top of the apple with the left there.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.560]   So I mean, if one was to read the tea leaves or the apple leaf,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.400]   however you want to phrase it, see you on the seventh.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.720]   Could be an indication of September 7th, of course.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.000]   But on the seventh, it's also rumored to be the seventh iPhone.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.480]   Oh.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.680]   Or the number seven iPhone.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.920]   Oh, of course.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   And Apple is sometimes clever.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.840]   Like the graphic design people, they don't know anything
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.680]   about future products.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.120]   They're just given a spec, but they do realize that spec.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.240]   And the heavy bokeh, some people are taking that as a sign
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.960]   that Apple really-- I mean, they've been rumored
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.800]   to be getting serious, even more serious about the camera,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.560]   doing things like a dual lens system that could increase low
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.520]   light, that could increase depth of field.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.720]   And bokeh is something that comes hand in hand
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.080]   with depth of field.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.800]   Proteus in our chat room says, I'm
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   hoping that's actually an iPhone 7 photo.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.040]   Is that possible?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.760]   I mean, if you compose the physical scene right,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.320]   you could probably get any photo you want.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.000]   Bokeh.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.400]   Andy, you're the photographic expert.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.680]   Is the shape and the size of the bokeh
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.120]   is determined by the shutter itself.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.640]   Like a leaf shutter gives you a different bokeh
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.040]   than an oval round shutter and stuff like that, right?
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   It's a different shutter.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.080]   It depends on the characteristics of the lens,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.600]   how small of an aperture you can get.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.120]   Phone cameras don't have great--
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.400]   They're not known for it, are they?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.760]   Basically, bokeh basically means having a sharp foreground
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   and a blurry background to sort of make the foreground pop.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.200]   Because of the way that nasty light works,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.680]   you can't really get that working well with a phone camera,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.320]   which is why synthetic imaging tends
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.080]   to be such a big hit with that sort of stuff.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   If you have a lens system or a photo system that
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   can discriminate with the foreground is, from the background,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.280]   they can just artificially blur out
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.160]   the background elements.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.680]   So we'll find out.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.840]   Round bokeh.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.080]   It's a Japanese word, bokeh.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.160]   I just like saying it.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.320]   Like that is kind of unusual.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.560]   Oh!
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   It's Apple's Christmas tree lights.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.800]   They're home kit enabled and they're announcing--
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   I've got some examples on my screen.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   It's usually--
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   Well, if you have pinpoint lights,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   so imagine that those were LEDs in the background.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.120]   That could do that.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.600]   Then it would reflect the shape of the aperture.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.960]   In that example that you have here,
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.760]   you see that the dots you see in the background there,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.560]   they're actually octagonal.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   They're not quite round.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.360]   You can see some-- Yeah.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.800]   And that comes from the shutter itself, I think.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.000]   Well, it comes from the aperture.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.760]   But also the shape of the bokeh, I think,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.800]   is determined a little bit by the kind of physical shutter.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   Then there's softer bokeh.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   It's about the opening that's--
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.800]   the opening in front of the--
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   I understand the size of the opening, right?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.320]   So first of all, you can have star-shaped bokeh
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   by putting a star filter, a jib, or whatever
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   in the lens.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.880]   Or maybe iPhone 7 is round.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.600]   They really are going to shake things up this year.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Are we over-analyzing?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   Or maybe the camera is just really, really terrible.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   And that's the best picture they could get.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920]   It's an iPhone 2 camera, and they were quite far away.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.480]   Perhaps we're over-analyzing this light is bit,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.880]   but it is true.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.640]   They're going to keep stalling ball back.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   They're saying, OK, better like this or better like this.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.640]   OK, clear like this, more like this.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.480]   Blurry away one, blurry away two.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   Blurry away one, and blurry away two.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's a case that generally because the chip is so small
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.280]   on a camera phone, you just don't get very interesting bokeh.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.320]   And there's no Z and-- I was trying to say Z.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   No, Z and index would be--
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.960]   You can say Z.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.520]   We are-- I've learned the last nation on the planet Earth
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   that still says Z in the English language nation.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.200]   It still says Z.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.320]   Well, you're metric at least, Leo.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   I mean, that's the important thing.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   I'm going to-- it's going to be Z.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.640]   It's Z.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.140]   OK.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.800]   So Z and index on the camera.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.720]   So when you start to try and put these different apertures
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.120]   and these different lenses in the camera,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.040]   because they make them so thin, there's no depth.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.480]   And that leads to a lot of aberration around the outside.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.240]   So a lot of the attempts we see in modern cameras
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   is to try to get the best of what they can out of the camera
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.520]   assembly so they can physically fit inside those units.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.000]   But bokeh--
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.280]   OK, like in that invitation would be considered very good.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.000]   Bokeh.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.680]   I mean, I'm sure it's something that they just put together
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.760]   to-- like Rene said.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.040]   They have fun with it because they know that we have fun with it.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   And they know that some of us take this way too seriously.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.320]   If they wanted to communicate that they
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.120]   were doing something interesting with the camera this time,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.920]   that's a good way to put it across.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.360]   It's one of the reasons why I'm so looking forward
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.040]   to seeing Apple do something radically different with the camera
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.280]   is that they are really good at figuring out
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.800]   how can we really think differently about how
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.560]   to make the cameras-- mobile cameras better.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.320]   We went through this phase that kind of ended at least two
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.440]   or three years ago about, well, we're
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.080]   going to try to see how we can put the biggest sensor possible
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.440]   and the best lens possible, as a matter of fact,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.680]   there is announcement-- or excuse me--
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.960]   a leak that Motorola has their--
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.720]   basically, the new mottos have pogo pins on the back of it.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.160]   And they can clip extra batteries and extra speakers.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.880]   One of the devices is Hasselblad.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.680]   Supposedly now has a camera assembly that
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   has its own sensor and its own zoom
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   and its own flash, right?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   That's the Nokia 1020 that has a 40 megapixel--
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.520]   40 megapixel megapixel megapixel.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.880]   But Apple's idea is that, well, we can either
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.240]   have a really, really awesome lens and a really, really
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.560]   awesome sensor, or we can just have a good lens and a good sensor
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.280]   and a really awesome CPU that can fake anything.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.160]   So if they have, for instance, a second lens as part one
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.480]   of the rumors, now that there are so many pictures of something
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.680]   with two lenses on it, if they have a second lens that
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.680]   can do nothing but collect more depth information,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.240]   just the fact that it's distant from even by three quarters
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   of a centimeter, that's enough that you can at least pull
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.000]   very near from very far and therefore synthesize.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.160]   We want to make sure that the shape and the foreground we
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.760]   think is now a human being.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.640]   So therefore, we want to have a color balance that differently
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.080]   from the background, which we now simply--
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.280]   which we now think is far enough behind that it must
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.680]   be a landscape of some sort.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.840]   So now you can do different exposure and different color
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   for each one of them and therefore get not quite the same
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.920]   effect as you'd get with a really, really handsome $800
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.560]   SLR lens, but something that is markedly better than what
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.160]   you're going to see from a conventional phone camera.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.760]   The site, by the way, if you want to read about Bokeh,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.840]   how it's created, what's good, what's bad, what it means,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.360]   JTRA.CZ.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   Jakob Travnik is a check in the Czech Republic
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.480]   and has a very good page of all sorts of interesting things
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.160]   about photography and math and Prague.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.080]   But on Bokeh is a series of articles
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.320]   that is really good about how Bokeh has created what it is.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.240]   Photographers like it.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.320]   They're not thinking math.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.200]   They like it because it gives you a very kind of lovely dream
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.720]   like background and it's wonderful for portraits,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.280]   particularly because it focuses your eye on the--
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.440]   Yeah. --on the person--
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   --product shots, too.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.520]   --and then product shots, too.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.880]   And then you have a nice creamy, beautiful background
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.280]   that isn't detailed enough to distract.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.120]   And it would be, I think, for some anyway,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   the holy grail of photography, of a camera phone photography.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   And of course, a hard thing to do because camera phones have
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.360]   cheap lenses, cheap optics, and small.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.000]   They have to be similar and thin.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.160]   And I think Apple-- the single most important thing,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   Apple-- well, there's two things.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.640]   Apple's already very good on battery life.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   Continued to double down on that, Apple.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.920]   Thank you.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   And the single most important thing
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.320]   they could do to overcome any negative that a loss of a headphone
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.560]   jack might bring is to have a camera that takes a leap forward.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.080]   And it would be--
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   And it's so popularly like the iPhone cameras
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.480]   year after year are just so popular.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:54.680]   Well--
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.160]   It affects so many people when they--
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.800]   It's not a camera phone anymore, frankly.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.040]   It's a computer.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   And the phone is becoming more and more secondary.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.760]   Nobody says, well, what's the phone quality?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.520]   That's not like-- no one has that.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.680]   But we very much are interested in how it feels, how it looks.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.320]   It's speed.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.520]   It's functionality.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   And I think the single-- in fact, I
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.720]   know because I've seen studies, the single most important
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.680]   function, the most used function on a smartphone, is the camera.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.640]   So this is a great place for Apple to double that.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.440]   More than emoji?
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.000]   More than emoji.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.440]   Wow.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.400]   Yes, we want to--
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.160]   We want a sports gun.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.920]   But it's going to be interesting to see
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.520]   if people react to a markedly better camera.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.840]   Because there is such a thing as--
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.040]   Number one, the research thing is
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.280]   good enough for a lot of people.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   I've long since dropped my elitism saying, oh, please,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.080]   if you have-- if you have a new baby,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.120]   don't take all of your pictures with an iPhone.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.760]   Get a real camera because the kid's not
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.560]   going to be six months old forever.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.720]   You're going to want to want a better picture than this.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.520]   And people are perfectly happy with a lot of pictures
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.120]   that they get.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.920]   I think that what's more effective than that
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.160]   is the idea of an upgrade to the camera that
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.560]   can solve a problem that the previous iPhone couldn't solve
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.240]   before.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.640]   So if you're talking about being able to focus really quickly
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.600]   in low light, if you're talking about being
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.280]   able to focus--
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.200]   doing focus tracking really, really fast,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.160]   if you're talking about as simple as being
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.760]   able to sense from--
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.680]   remember that the iPhone camera is always
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.480]   looking through that lens, even when you're not actually
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.840]   taking a picture if the camera app is open.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.240]   Something as simple as recognizing
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   that there seems to be a lot of movement happening.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.280]   And so I'm going to go against my basic nature,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.920]   and I'm going to do whatever I have
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.360]   to have a really, really fast shutter speed,
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.920]   so I freeze that action.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   When I take-- I usually do my standard camera tests
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.000]   on pretty much every phone.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.040]   And the odd thing is that when there's a scene
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.760]   where they move the moving subject,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.680]   the iPhone, even the latest generation,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.560]   doesn't do as well as Android phones.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   And the only reason why is because the iPhone tends
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.760]   to do whatever it can to avoid having a short--
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.200]   to avoid having to increase the sensitivity,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.080]   the light sensitivity of the sensor.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   So if it means that this is going to choose
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.560]   1/30 of a second instead of 1/125 of a second,
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.680]   it's going to choose 1/30.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.640]   And that's the difference between beautiful, tack sharp.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.440]   And OK, that's sharp, I guess.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.280]   And taking a picture of your dog,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.120]   and you can actually see the hairs on the dog's nose
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.880]   in perfect detail.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.640]   So there's a lot that Apple can do,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   so long as it's less the question of making things look
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.400]   like you shot it with a medium format, a Hasselblad camera,
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.440]   and more like, oh, a picture that
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.720]   would have been crap in the previous generation camera.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.160]   Now I can actually count on it to actually work.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.640]   So all right, because I'm thinking, to be honest,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.080]   the calculus I'm making-- I bet I'm not alone here--
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.840]   is do I need to upgrade my iPhone 6s plus?
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.960]   It's only been a year.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.840]   Now, obviously, I buy every phone,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.040]   so I may be not typical.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.600]   But there are people out there with iPhone 6s, or even 5s,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.880]   or 5s, who are thinking the same thing.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.840]   And I'm thinking, what would make me do it?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.920]   And Apple put a little speed bump in there.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.640]   I really have to deal with the idea that my--
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.680]   all my headphones aren't going to work on that thing,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.800]   that I'm going to have to use these Apple headphones,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.480]   or an adapter, or wireless headphones.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   That's a speed bump.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.920]   It's not the end of the world, it's a speed bump.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.080]   And I'm trying to think, what feature?
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.680]   Because we are-- I mean, let's face it.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.320]   These are very mature products.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.720]   It's hard to think of something new you can do
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.440]   that's going to get people excited.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.480]   And I think it's not surprising that that invitation
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.600]   clearly focuses on photography, because that's one thing.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.480]   But what else?
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   What else could be?
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's really true.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.280]   But there's a flip side of that too,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   and it's almost become perfunctory.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   Like, it used to be when you're on a two-year contract,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.520]   you would just get the next phone when you're
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.880]   two-year contract ran out.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.640]   Some people got used to selling whatever
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.080]   is the latest phone and buying the new phone,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.160]   because they always wanted the latest and the greatest.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.400]   And now some people are on the subscription program
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.320]   where they pay Apple or their carrier every month.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.680]   And then every year, they get to trade in their old phone
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.400]   for a new phone.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.680]   So I think the entire dynamic has changed.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.880]   But to your point, yeah, the camera is huge.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.600]   Again, the color, for some reason,
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.120]   is super important to people.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.520]   If you had a rose gold iPhone or previously a gold iPhone,
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.560]   and now if the space blue is true or the gloss black is true,
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.720]   I think some people have just-- they've
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.800]   been waiting for a blacked-out iPhone for a long time.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.680]   They'd love that.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.880]   Or they want the latest color, and they want to show off.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.040]   It's just a black-black iPhone, all black.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   Like, the rumor was like the Apple--
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.120]   sorry, like the Mac Pro black.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.760]   Oh, like a mirror black.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.520]   OK.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.120]   That's a fingerprint magnet, like, cray.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   I mean, I have to say, as beautiful as this,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.080]   this is the Galaxy Note 7.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.880]   And I love this silver finish, right?
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.680]   And the thing is-- I mean, you never
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.120]   see the silver finish, because the thing is--
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.920]   it's just fingerprint magnet.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.120]   It just looks awful, except that I love--
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.720]   if I could just keep it polished up.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.440]   It looks great.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.840]   And of course, a piano black would be exactly the same.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.080]   It would be worse.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.960]   It would be a worse problem, right?
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.600]   So I don't know.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.760]   Do people really care about the beauty of the--
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   It's what the heart wants, right?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.880]   It's what people do.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.280]   At least that's part of the buying decision.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.240]   And then you put in a case and you forget that you did that.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.200]   But it's certainly part of the buying decision.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.360]   It's part of-- yeah, I think that we
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.280]   love to dig into the technical details and what we like.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.800]   I think that we hate to confront the fact
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.480]   that you're talking about making people happy for four days tops.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.200]   That's all you've got to do.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.720]   I'm serious.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   I'm serious.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   It's like--
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   You're absolutely right.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.520]   It's like because after-- you will get--
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.720]   you will get people who are buying this because, oh, I just
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.560]   love this.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.040]   I know that I've only had this phone for a year, year and a half.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.880]   But I just love that matte black finish.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.200]   And then they'll buy it.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.800]   They'll happy they have the matte black.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.520]   And then they don't care about it anymore.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.120]   And there's a lot to that, even to a much better
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.000]   improved camera, where if I get a phone with a camera that's
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.560]   150% better than the old one, I'm
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.280]   guessing that I'll be thrilled with it.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.320]   And I can't stop talking about it for three or four weeks.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.640]   After that, I'll be--
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.800]   I'll not want to do a side-by-side comparison between what
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.120]   does my-- what kind of pictures does my old phone take
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.880]   versus what kind of pictures does the new phone take
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.560]   after just five minutes of tweaking the image to get it
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.640]   the way that I like it, which is what I would do with any
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.840]   picture that I would take.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   So I think that--
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.000]   But having more data.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.680]   Having the two lenses and having more data might be very
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   helpful in that post.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.280]   I agree with you, after two weeks.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.840]   Absolutely.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.000]   Absolutely.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.920]   That's super, super exciting.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.440]   We are seeing kind of an observational difference,
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.360]   a difference in philosophies between Apple that knows
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.280]   hardware and they know integration and they know system.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.520]   So they can build an entire phone that's built around.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.320]   We're pretty much everything.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   CPU, data path, choice of RAM, choice of responses
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.760]   on the touchscreen is in effect part of the camera feature.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.920]   But then you're kind of competing against apps like
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   Instagram, apps like Google's Photo app and services
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.480]   like Google Photos, where if you have a service where you
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.680]   take a picture, it is instantly synced up to the cloud
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.360]   where a server does about the equivalent of three hours
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   worth of professional Photoshop work on it.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.040]   And basically updates that picture automatically and does
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.240]   that automatically in one nanosecond.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.360]   As far as you're concerned, when you're looking at your
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.240]   camera roll, does it matter to the user that this picture was
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.080]   not very good taken by the hardware, but the picture that
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.640]   landed in your camera roll is superb.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.560]   So if anybody wants to sort of fight Apple on the best
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.320]   picture quality front, they might be able to do that.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.560]   Simply by saying that, well, we had some people working for
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.200]   six weeks to improve the algorithms that we have in
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.120]   Google Photos or in our Facebook Photo System that
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.680]   automatically enhances things and makes things look amazing
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.400]   and wonderful.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.480]   And then lastly, remember the lessons that Apple, every
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.040]   other big player has learned from Snapchat and all these
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.520]   other apps for messaging, where they're thinking, well, look
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.040]   at our messaging platform and look at our security and look
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.480]   at this and that and the other.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.320]   Look how easy it is to conference people in.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.920]   Look at our face filters, man.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.440]   Exactly.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.040]   And what really got people excited is, hey, look, I can
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.400]   have a tiara on my head automatically.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.040]   So it's so hard to guess what is really going to get
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.640]   excited, people excited and excited enough to hand over
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   their old phone and get a new one.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.440]   This is the image I'm sure you're referring to Renee from 9 to
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.040]   5, Mac.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.440]   It's actually originated on a Japanese blog.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.720]   Talk about straws.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.000]   These are SIM card, SIM slot covers in five different colors.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.560]   Who knows their provenance.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.480]   This would be an easy one to fake.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.320]   I don't want to guess how intensely every employee at
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.160]   that factory was searched to make sure that nobody had any
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.600]   of those out there.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   But that's a good point.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.160]   That's an easy thing to smuggle out.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.240]   And so there is a piano black, a white, a space gray, a rose
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.080]   gold and a gold.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   And that-- I mean, I have to say what it makes sense.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.680]   Although it is unlike Apple to do five different colors.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   There's a rumor of a space blue.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.920]   And one of the problems with-- and white would be new,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.400]   because they've been doing-- unless it's probably silver.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.320]   And then the other ones are gold and rose gold.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.040]   But they tried to do black with the iPhone 5.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.600]   And black, when you anodize it, it is the hardest colored
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.960]   anodized gold, I believe, is the easiest.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.320]   And because it chips and flakes and all those things,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   and military spec is several layers.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.960]   And it's not-- still, it's kind of gunky when you start
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.880]   putting that many layers of anodization on it.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   So people have been asking for darker forever.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.640]   When the Apple Watch came out, it's darker.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.160]   Because it's sort of an easier-- it's on your wrist.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.240]   It's sort of an easier thing to do.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   People want that on the iPhone.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.520]   I would love a black steel iPhone.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.800]   I know it would weigh a ton.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.320]   But I would love the stainless steel
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.800]   that they make the Apple Watch in.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.440]   But it's just because fans-- there's
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.320]   a huge watch community, a huge car community,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   a huge phone community.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.080]   They're people who just like the blacked out look.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.920]   And I think that's what-- it's also--
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's also where we are, frankly, in the evolution
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.160]   of smartphones we are now.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.760]   I mean, that's the same thing happened with cars.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.960]   That happens with everything else.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.360]   But now at the fashion stage.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.120]   Got the fins, Leo.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   The fins on the back.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.960]   It's all about fins.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.800]   So all right, so we've pinpointed two things--
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   camera, finish or look or colors.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.080]   What else could make the difference between buying it?
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.480]   Water--
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.440]   Increased water resistance.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.680]   The iPhone 6S already has water resistance.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.600]   But they didn't touch it.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.280]   They didn't touch it.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.440]   No, no, because legal--
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.360]   lawyers are hard.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.960]   But it's got a gasket that goes around the entire outside.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.440]   And it's got all the points sealed.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.480]   And at some point, maybe someone
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.520]   will drop it in a river and feel,
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.440]   "Well, we'll retweet it."
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.680]   And then the secret will be out.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.760]   But if they continue doing that--
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   and water certification is not the same.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.640]   Jerry Hildenbrandt, right central, did a great article
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.560]   today on what all those IP ratings actually mean.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.000]   And you have to be vacuum dust proof to get the dust ingress.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.360]   But the watering grass, a lot of it,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.760]   is left up to the manufacturer.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.240]   So it can be three meters for 30 minutes.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.480]   But if you do it 33 times, it's going to fail.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.920]   And that's why some waters and phones fail.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.200]   And consumer reports write about it,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.280]   because not everyone is up to the same extent.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.440]   Not every individual unit is up to the same standard.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.920]   But I think if you just make it so that people drop it in water
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.640]   and they pull it out and it's fine,
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.560]   you've solved a huge problem for them.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.080]   Right.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.600]   All right.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.400]   All the manufacturer has to do is say what they mean by watering
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.160]   grass.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.720]   There's one standard for splashing.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.600]   So, for instance, getting caught in the rain with your phone.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.720]   There's another one that--
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.960]   the more important one is, how does it handle water pressure?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.560]   So you see, just like those really silly Samsung Galaxy
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.840]   ads where you have the musician pouring champagne
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.200]   over the top of it forever.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.120]   You mean--
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.360]   You mean little Wayne?
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   I'm the musician.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.120]   I've not done that with an iPhone.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.360]   The iPhone is fine that way too.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.920]   I said, I said, I'm a little Wayne.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.240]   I meant Lil Wayne.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.840]   My hip hop flash charger.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   I wrote a date.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.760]   Lil Wayne.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.000]   But yeah.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.840]   But that's nothing.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.560]   That's like-- what you really worry about
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.520]   is when you put it under even two feet of water,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.440]   that's actually water being forced in.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.200]   I beg you to differ.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.920]   I think Lil Wayne worries a lot about spilled champagne.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.880]   I think he does.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   I think that's a big issue.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.920]   What if the phone doesn't--
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.520]   The phone is strange commercial.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.640]   So you're telling consumers, now, here's
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.920]   this really, really rich celebrity who lives in a mansion
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.240]   and cares so little about his luxury items
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.520]   that he can actually pour expensive champagne,
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.880]   try to destroy his expensive phone.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.160]   You could be just like that guy.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.080]   We should point out that that is a Samsung ad, not an Apple ad.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.600]   Exactly.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.000]   So the Samsung ad.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.720]   It's such a weird one.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.960]   But I haven't read it by the way.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.360]   And his buddy pulls out an iPhone does the same thing.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:13.480]   So Lil Wayne then pulls out an extra Samsung phone
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.360]   and gives it to him.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.560]   Yo, I heard you like Samsung phone.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.920]   So we gave you a Samsung phone inside your Samsung phone.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.440]   But it's pretty wild, isn't it?
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.680]   But yeah, but I mean, it's--
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.160]   like my name said, so many phones are actually really, really
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.000]   built well to the stand being dropped in a puddle,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.440]   dropped in a pool.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.560]   But oh my god, you jumped into you,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.400]   grab it before it's been under there for more than, let's
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.360]   say, a minute.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   Even my cheap Nexus 5X doesn't have an official IP
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.040]   certification, but there are plenty of videos of people
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.480]   who were willing to take the ultimate test.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.000]   And there's one video that I really like where someone just
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.320]   has this fishbowl and just dropped it in there.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.760]   And it's running for a full hour.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.280]   The screen's still lit and takes it out and still working fine.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.040]   Question is, was the speaker still working fine?
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.360]   Was the microphone still working fine?
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.960]   But in terms of ingress that would kill the phone, again,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.120]   this is at best a mid-range price phone.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.680]   It has no certification whatsoever.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.200]   And yet it had no problem with that.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.640]   So I've said this before, so the short version, again,
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.520]   is just going to be--
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.800]   I haven't written about the question
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.720]   of deleting the headphone jacks.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.440]   I feel like I need to know what story Apple's going to tell
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.320]   before I can kind of react to it.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.200]   But it's going to be--
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.160]   Is it just going to be spin, though, Andy, really?
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.200]   I mean--
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.800]   I think so.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.680]   I really think that the actual physical reason is going
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.120]   to be that sometime next year or the year after we
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.360]   want to do a redesign in which the screen is--
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.240]   it takes up the entire surface.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.600]   And for the version that we're going
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.040]   to be making next year or the year after,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   the component layout is such that we
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.880]   won't have room for a headphone jack.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.560]   And that's why we're deleting it now,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   because why not just do it now?
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.120]   So it would be kind of a style thing.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.880]   But I'm curious to see if they're going to be gutsy enough
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.720]   to say, we've solved a big problem
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.280]   that all of you were clamoring, that everyone--
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.480]   it's so--
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.000]   I'm curious to see how they actually spin this.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.800]   It's going to be pain in the butt for the next year.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   I just get a headphone jack.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.440]   They've handed them forever.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.200]   They did something mean to them when they were in school.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.800]   And now it's finally in a position
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.720]   to have their revenge and to get a take.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.480]   They're going to say, well, what about the babies
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.800]   and toddlers who can get strangled by that cord?
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.360]   Like, we want to save children's lives.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360]   Why is Samsung--
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   Why is Samsung--
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.080]   Why is Samsung not care about babies' lives?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.680]   From a kind of totally abstract point of view,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.480]   it will be fascinating for marketers
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.120]   to watch how one of the great marketing companies of all time
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.600]   handles what could be a real problem.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.200]   And I'm sure they will have some wonderful rationale
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.160]   that makes everybody go, oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.480]   I'm going to go back to my thing.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   So I care less about them removing the headphone jack
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.600]   than I do how they handle the actual transition.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.040]   Because when they went from Doc to Lightning, fine.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.160]   Lightning, Doc was old.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.200]   You know, that was--
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   It's a tough move, but a good move.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.040]   Yeah, but they didn't have any adapters on sale for like two
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.680]   weeks after the phone came out.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.080]   And God help you if you lost the Lightning cable that came in
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.960]   your box and just couldn't get another one.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.480]   And if you're going to do a major accessory transition
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.600]   or a major connector transition, you
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.080]   have to make sure that all the adapters, all the extra cables,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   are there day and date with the phone.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.920]   It can't be a maybe.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.840]   It can't be we tried.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.440]   It can't be we have--
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.720]   they got lost in shipping or we had delays or the chips
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.440]   or something.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.720]   You are taking away something that used to work
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.280]   and you have to make sure that it works.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.040]   So an Apple has never put an adapter in a box before.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.880]   I hope they do with this because it's sort of like you're
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.840]   causing some pains.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.080]   At least you can do is provide a salve.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.560]   But they have to make sure that they and other companies
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.880]   have all sorts of--
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.840]   I mean, I saw some Bluetooth adapters the other day.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.520]   Companies are already making Bluetooth adapters.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.760]   And you person just made a Bluetooth adapter, yeah.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.440]   The tapes don't have to be in stores.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.760]   It basically takes the Bluetooth from your phone
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.520]   and makes it possible to use regular headphones.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.520]   So that's the big issue for me is all the legacy--
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   You had to get it in the phone.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.640]   I literally have a cupboard filled with headphones
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.200]   with 3 and 1/2 millimeter jacks, which will be obsoleteed.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.720]   So--
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.920]   A little bit more Leo.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.360]   It's well, let's be fair.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.080]   I mean, how many sets of wired headphones do you actually need?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.880]   You just need to have one handy when you need one.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.120]   And for most people, so long as they don't wash their headphones
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.720]   with their pants at the end of the day,
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   they're pretty much covered.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.640]   I don't think this will be the end of the world.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.800]   I don't think this will be the end of iPhone.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.640]   If it affects sales, I don't think it'll--
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.000]   I don't think it'll do anything but push people who
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.680]   are probably likely to be leaving the iPhone
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.080]   for another platform anyway.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.440]   It's just the statement-- like Rene said,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.760]   it's going to be interesting to see if they make the statement--
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.720]   at least nod towards we realize that this is going
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.480]   to be a big, hawking inconvenience for a great many people.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   And also, it's going to cheese off a great number of people,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.880]   even the ones who are going-- even the ones who are going
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.040]   to be buying the iPhone 7 anyway, they're not going to say,
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.320]   oh, thank you, Apple.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.880]   Thank God you finally got rid of the headphone jack.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.920]   They're saying, well, I really want the new phone.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.040]   I hate the fact that it doesn't have a headphone jack,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.160]   but that's not going to stop me.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.960]   It's going to be interesting if they acknowledge
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.000]   that we are inflicting a small amount of pain.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.880]   But one of the things that we all collectively like about Apple
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.520]   is that they have the ability to do exactly what they want.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.000]   And if what they want can be kind of weird and kind of a bummer
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.760]   for at least a couple of years for the first people
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.560]   to use this, that's OK because they're
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.800]   heading someplace with this.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.720]   I feel like it's a perilous time to do this.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   I feel like this is a--
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.120]   you could do it at a better time.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.280]   This is not a good time.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.960]   Apple is not particularly ahead in technology.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.920]   So people are looking at other phones.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.360]   There are--
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.840]   I feel like--
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.000]   My sales are down.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.200]   Sales are already down.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   You're seeing a broad range of phones--
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.020]   Android phones with a broad range of capabilities
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.840]   that might appeal.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.300]   I feel like--
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.040]   I feel like it's so interesting.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:18.600]   I feel like if this was--
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.840]   If phones are so expensive and now we're also seeing a broad range
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.160]   of second tier phones starting at $400,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.360]   this is going to be $1,000 phone.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.080]   Isn't it super interesting, though, that--
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.280]   I could see this being taught at Apple University five years
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:30.640]   from now.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.680]   This is a case study where it is the most important product
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   this company has.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.400]   They're basically their only job every year
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.240]   is to get people to buy iPhones.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.880]   The iPhone has become a product that--
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.840]   you can argue about whether the iPhone 6 was an anomaly or not
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.320]   and sucked adoptions forward when it would otherwise
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.640]   be spread out on a normal curve.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.840]   Whatever--
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.600]   iPhone sales are no longer on the rocket hockey stick
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.920]   graph that they used to be.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.120]   And yet, Apple, who is by all measure an intelligence
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.200]   savvy company, is supposedly-- because it hasn't actually
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.920]   shipped yet--
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.880]   doing something which makes a lot of people feel very uneasy.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.440]   Do they have rock solid data?
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.040]   Do they know that this is the future?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.080]   Are they going to have a technology so compelling?
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.240]   They don't think people will care.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.520]   Why would Apple do this?
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.600]   Why would they risk their most popular, most profitable product
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.120]   line?
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.840]   Good question.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.040]   Why?
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.760]   Seeing that at the event, that's going to be--
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.120]   because, again, they're not dumb.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.760]   If you go through this--
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.120]   Oh, no, I agree with you.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   That's why it's going to be a fascinating marketing
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.040]   study, won't it?
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:25.560]   Absolutely.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.200]   This is a case study right here.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.960]   It also-- we can't ignore the fact
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.200]   that Apple is as much unity as they present to the outside world.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.520]   They are a big company with a lot of very, very smart people
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.840]   that are used to making solid arguments and people
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.400]   listening to those arguments.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.160]   The number of times where something that seemed kind of like
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.840]   a dicey proposition only came at the end of real arguments
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.120]   that went on for weeks and months and only got settled
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.240]   by the fact that there is one person that can finally say
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.440]   yay or nay for no other reason than to say
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.040]   that these are both good ideas.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.400]   My gut tells me we're going to go with option a,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.800]   and we're going ahead with option a.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.440]   Bits and pieces come about from the rollout
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.960]   of the gold Apple watch.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.640]   And I'm very certain that there was
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.240]   a lot of infighting about the direction
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.920]   of that particular product as well.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.700]   But I'm certain that every-- each side
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.960]   had really good data to present.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.400]   I'm sure that this was an item of intense discussion.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.040]   And I'm also pretty sure that in the end,
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.960]   they decided that this is not going to cost us--
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.120]   if people are not going to not buy our phone because it was
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.240]   because we switched to headphone standards,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.280]   they will have switched because we were already not meeting
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.800]   their needs.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.360]   We were already about to lose them.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.040]   And we are not in the position where
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.160]   we have to convince that small percentage of people
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.480]   to come back to us.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.120]   We just have to keep on keeping on.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.360]   Like I said, if it means that next year, they can have--
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.920]   they can have a home button that is completely integrated
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.720]   into the screen.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   They can have a-- the first phone they've
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.560]   been able to make in maybe four or five years that
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.400]   looks materially different from pretty much every other smartphone
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.360]   that's out there by being unique and having a full--
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.480]   no matter how much we are charging you in real estate
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.160]   in your pocket or in your purse, we
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   are basically putting pixels on every square millimeter
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.240]   of that real estate we are demanding from your pocket
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.040]   or your purse.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.760]   That's something they can really go for.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.360]   Samsung put the screen and wrapped it around the edges,
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.400]   which is stylistically quite cool and a couple
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.960]   of kind of nice features about it.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.440]   But it really is style.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   Apple is the one that can say, we are giving you--
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.160]   we're even getting rid of the rounded edges.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.760]   We are giving you this really beautiful 2001 style monolith only.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.720]   It's about this big and every single--
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.960]   can you imagine pixels that go all the way
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.520]   to the edge of the screen, edge of the frame?
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.720]   I mean, and I don't mean that, oh, look, the bezel's really small.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.440]   I'm saying that you have to really look closely
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.360]   to see that there is any sort of a bezel at all.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.840]   Style decisions are not my favorite thing when
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.480]   it comes to a practical device like this.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.840]   But, oh, boy, would I be staring longingly and lovingly
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.480]   at such a device?
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.800]   It's as simple as that, Alec.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.640]   And could it be that, you know, Johnny
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.360]   wants to delete everything that's not screen?
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.000]   I think that's a popular narrative.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.080]   And if they do it all the same time--
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   --the same time--
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   --the home button's going away next year.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   Yeah, the home button.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.320]   And I wouldn't be surprised if we have forced touch
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.800]   the everything at some point.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.040]   But if they want to delete everything,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.640]   and next year we have just a screen
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.040]   and the millimeter of the headphone jack goes with
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.880]   at the same time, the story could be overlaid,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.320]   but people upset with the headphone jack.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.040]   If you do it this year, you get all that drama out of the way.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.760]   And then when you unveil the full screen model,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.400]   the entire story is full screen model.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.800]   What about the headphone jack anymore?
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.600]   I was talking to a friend yesterday
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   about strategy versus tactics.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.800]   It was a really interesting conversation.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.560]   Apple clearly is a strategically very smart company.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.080]   They really think long term, and that's
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.840]   what you do with strategy.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   And I'm a chess player, so I think in terms of chess,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.800]   your strategy, your long term plan.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   But there's also short term execution issues, tactics.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.560]   And this is an example of where you have tactics
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.880]   and you have strategy, you may have a strategy,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.240]   and then you have to think tactically,
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.560]   what do we do today so that we can execute our strategy
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.400]   tomorrow?
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.560]   And I think that's what you're talking about here.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.120]   And I think that would be, it's interesting.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.640]   I think Apple is good at that.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.800]   I think they've also messed up some tactics in the past.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.320]   So this is going to be--
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.400]   I feel it's a challenge, I really do.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.960]   That is an interesting discussion.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.560]   I keep a lot of what I've been thinking about in this next
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.120]   iPhone, really has me reliving the experience
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.720]   of seeing the first iMac rollout.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.920]   And part of me wonders if--
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.280]   I definitely see the point of, well,
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.320]   if we're going to rip off that Band-Aid,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.160]   let's make sure that Wound has healed by the time
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.400]   we release the next iPhone.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.520]   May as we'll do it sooner rather than later.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.480]   The other way of thinking about it
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.180]   would be that what if we created it, what if next year's
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.440]   phone were so revolutionary in such a departure
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.040]   from everything we've done before,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.120]   that kind of like how it took us all a day
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.160]   to realize that the first iMac does not have a disk drive.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.120]   It's like, it would be, well, I don't care.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   I don't care about the lack of a headphone jack.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.360]   If I can get that wonderful screen,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.520]   if I can get those haptics that work over the entire force
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.280]   of the display, if I can get that really wonderful butterscotch
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.560]   smell that happens every time there's a new email from my mom,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   I don't care about the lack of a headphone jack.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.760]   And the camera's no looking good.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.120]   Exactly that.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.400]   The camera may be sufficient on this iteration
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.320]   to overcome that slight speed bump.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:41.760]   We'll see.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.160]   We'll see.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.360]   It's coming soon.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.440]   We're going to do live coverage of the event Wednesday.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.760]   The invitations, as you know, went out.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.600]   Renee, I take it.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   You're going.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.600]   Yes, sir.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.840]   We're going to be the stay behinds, Andy and I and Megan
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.680]   Moroni.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.600]   And we'll cover it starting 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.920]   times, 1,700 UTC.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.200]   We'll start a little early, as we always do, of course,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.000]   here on Twitter.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.480]   That's next Wednesday, week from tomorrow.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.600]   And so soon.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   So soon.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.680]   And to that end, we will flip flop Windows weekly
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.200]   and Mac break weekly next week.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.320]   So Windows weekly will be on Tuesday, where this show is
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.360]   a week from today.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.480]   And Mac break weekly will be right after the Apple event.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.840]   And maybe we can catch you coming out of the event, Renee.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.120]   I know there'll be a hands-on.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.240]   And I always like to--
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.560]   that's the one thing I really miss about going to the events
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.760]   is the chance to play with these devices.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.520]   You still think the predictions will hold that Friday following
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.360]   a week from Friday will be able to pre-order.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   The typical midnight online pre-order and delivery
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.680]   a couple of weeks hence.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.040]   Yeah, it's always a function of--
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.960]   I mean, they're making tens--
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.120]   if not hundreds of millions eventually of these phones.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.800]   It always depends on how many they can get onto store shelves.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.200]   And sometimes they do a really good job.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.440]   And sometimes things like displays or chips
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.680]   or some aspect of it proves to have a lower yield rate.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.400]   Or the demand forecasting is off.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.800]   Let me start with the iPhone SE.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.840]   And they just didn't make as many as they needed.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   And so there's always something that might make the orders get
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.160]   delayed or might make the actual delivery date a week out,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.840]   three weeks out, so I suppose two weeks out, or whatnot.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.000]   But it'll be within that frame.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   That period of time.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.520]   Yep.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.480]   But about a dozen people will be coming back
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.600]   from that event with NDAs and Loner Hardware.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.400]   Their first reviews will hit a week after that.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.000]   And then they'll be available for sale on Friday.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.960]   Is it that many for the Walt Mossbergs, the Ed Bags, the Brian
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.080]   and Chen's, the--
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   It's more nationally now because people in Canada
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.880]   and New Zealand and Australia--
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.080]   Somebody for mine, more for sure, will probably you
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.440]   will walk home with a phone.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.320]   Not usually.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.920]   No.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.360]   You don't get the phone?
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.280]   No, not not really.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.040]   No.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.600]   It's not-- it's the big general interest publications.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.000]   Yeah, broadcast media, the big biz pubs, the trade pub, yeah.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.800]   Broadcast media, huh?
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.160]   Well, because they know how--
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.920]   There's so many mutants like us that are already talking
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.280]   about it.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.800]   Right.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.120]   They don't need to do anything for us.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.600]   Exactly.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.320]   They know that I'm going to be devoting at least two columns
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.720]   to it next week.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.520]   The big deal is to get CNN to not just simply, oh,
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.720]   and on the lighter side of the news,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   wacky fruit-based company, they want
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.680]   to get 12 minutes of, here's how wonderful this thing is.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.160]   And at the top of every hour--
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   And we've got the first sneaks, the next new phone,
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.920]   that really is an impressive currency.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.880]   And so that's where they can spend their money very well.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.800]   You've got to throw Jimmy Fallon into the mix,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   people like that.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.240]   I think they--
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.400]   Yeah, well, usually it's like Josh Topolsky
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.760]   in the older days and now Nulei Patel.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.640]   Somebody will take it on one of those shows.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.120]   Right.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.080]   All right, let's take a break because Apple has a big tax
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.360]   bill and I want to give them some time to save up.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.440]   But--
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.320]   Millions a minute, Leo.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.240]   Millions a minute, my friends.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.880]   But first, a word about your car.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.680]   And the best little do-hickey you can add to your car
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.600]   ever, the auto-matic.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   All cars built since 1996 have an OBD port.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.120]   It's on-board diagnostic port.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.680]   And the cool thing about the OBD port,
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.400]   when you first see it, it looks like, well, that must be--
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.120]   if you see it, by the way, I think a lot of people
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.880]   don't even know it exists.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.000]   That's why I mention it.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.960]   It's right under your steering wheel on the driver's side,
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.800]   almost always.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.160]   And when you first see it, you might look and say, oh, yeah,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.600]   well, nothing I can do with that.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.000]   That's for the technician at the dealer.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.960]   In fact, there is something you can do.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.240]   And that's this.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.000]   This is the automatic.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   It goes right on that OBD to port pairs to your smartphone
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.680]   using Bluetooth.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.440]   And then your smartphone can give you
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.560]   all sorts of information.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.120]   If the check engine light comes on,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   your smartphone, running the automatic software,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.880]   will say, oh, that light means this.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.720]   And here's where a repair shop is in your area.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.360]   It's actually amazing.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.000]   It can tell you how you drove.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.080]   I have it working with if this than that.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.440]   And it saves out to Evernote.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.040]   Every time I take a trip, it records the duration of the trip.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.280]   It gives me a little map of the trip, how much gas I used.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Based on average gas prices in the area,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.960]   how much that would have cost.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.600]   That's really interesting.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.400]   That commute to work costs you $25, whatever.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.120]   That also gives you a score.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.000]   Gamifies it to increase gas mileage,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.680]   whether you-- how hard accelerations are hard breaking.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   Really is great.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.040]   If you've got a teenager who love it, you've got geofencing.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.920]   So you can actually see where they are,
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.800]   because this is the new automatic pro.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.160]   It adds 3G.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.120]   Now we're really cooking here.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.360]   So you don't have to have your phone in the car
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.520]   to know where your car is.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.760]   The 3G communicates with the internet.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.040]   And it-- and it'll let you know where your vehicle is parked,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.680]   or where it's driving, even when you're not in it.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.280]   Oh my god, this is awesome.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.600]   And by the way, no subscription fee.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.240]   The 3G is free.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.880]   It works with if this than that.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   Concur, Expensiveive, Keep Trap, Bizzes, Miles.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.000]   It's great for that, FreshBooks.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.920]   You can link it to your-- anything,
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.480]   your Nest thermostat, your Amazon Echo.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.480]   You literally can say to your Echo, where did I park my car?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.160]   And it will tell you.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.680]   You can send yo's.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.520]   So when you're on your way home,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.080]   yo can tell your honey, hey, he's on his way home.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.520]   Yo.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.560]   And this is more serious, Vane.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.280]   You can also get human help in a crash,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.160]   automatic, pro-detect severe accidents.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.120]   And trained responders can call for help, even if you can't.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.000]   This is the new automatic.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.320]   This is the new hotness.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   Let's get it right now.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:53.880]   All of that, including free 3G for five years, $129.95.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.400]   That's really remarkable.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.960]   But you know what?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.240]   If you use the offer code TWIT, you're
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.560]   going to save 20 bucks right off the top.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.040]   Automatic.com/twit to find out more.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.880]   Remember, use the offer code TWIT at checkout,
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.920]   and you'll save $20 off the regular purchase price.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.760]   And you'll be getting the new automatic pro
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.720]   with no subscription cost, no fees.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.240]   That's it.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.120]   That's the flat rate.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.320]   I think they say five years, probably just
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.680]   so it doesn't go forever.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.000]   But it's a 3G subscription in the US free for five years.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.840]   Kind of like what Amazon did with the Kindle and the Whisper
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.720]   link.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.400]   That is awesome.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.120]   Even better, the automatic pro, automatic.com/twit.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.960]   Use the offer code TWIT to save 20 bucks.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:43.720]   Ah, $14 and 1/2 billion.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.800]   A lot of euro.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.120]   That's the tax bill.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:53.160]   This is from the EC, our favorite, Margarete Vistaica,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.440]   our favorite European commissioner.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.520]   Apple, no.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   Says Irish tax rulings to Apple are illegal state aid,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.140]   making the taxation rate, the effective tax
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:12.120]   duration rate for Apple, as low as 0.005%.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:19.200]   Apple must repay up to 13 billion euros in unpaid tax.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.800]   Apple's response.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.560]   I'm sure we'll get this overturned.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.640]   I'm sure they hope so.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.120]   That's a lot of money.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.800]   That's a flavor.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.320]   Go ahead.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:30.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.040]   I was going to say my favorite response that I heard offline
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.560]   from this is Tim Cook gave his most malice-free factual
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.840]   F off in history.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.640]   That's statement.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.320]   Wow.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   What was his statement?
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:42.680]   It wasn't--
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.160]   Well, it wasn't--
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   It wasn't--
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.800]   --and off.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   It was--
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.360]   It released a letter that basically saying that--
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.400]   I'll show Nate I remind you that the Apple is the largest
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.640]   taxpayer in the United States of America.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.280]   And the largest taxpayer in Ireland.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.840]   It's basically putting a human face on it,
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.160]   because they know that obviously it's a bad scene of people
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.040]   think that Apple is a bunch of tax dodgers.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   They're making the case that when we've been in Ireland
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   since 1980, at the time we took the advice of both the Irish
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.800]   government and also other governments
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.000]   to make sure that we were doing everything properly
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.400]   to pay the proper amount of taxes.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.960]   Ireland is happy with this.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.760]   We're happy with this.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   We're both upset that this outside agency
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.480]   is telling Ireland that even though Ireland says
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.280]   we paid enough taxes that we should be paying more taxes,
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.520]   and therefore we feel as though this is going to be a bad thing
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.240]   for the country of Ireland and for all
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.720]   European nations if we don't fight this,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.760]   so we're going to fight this.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.320]   He said we never asked for it, and nor did we ever receive
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.440]   any special deals.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.360]   We have 6,000 employees in Ireland.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:54.520]   And I think his best point is this
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.320]   is dangerous for any company in Ireland
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.000]   that the laws could retroactively be changed.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   That the tax--
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.080]   I believe we could--
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.640]   --apply with tax law.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.480]   Now they're saying, no, your advice from Ireland,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.040]   your bill from Ireland, that was wrong.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.320]   We're going to fix that.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.600]   Yeah, specifically.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.560]   But it's not only that--
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.280]   oh, I'm sorry, I'll let everyone speak.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.800]   It's not only that, but the idea that, look, Ireland,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.200]   we've paid every penny of the taxes that Ireland has said
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.480]   that we owe.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.280]   And so why is somebody else saying that we retroactively
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.320]   owe these taxes?
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.000]   That's what the-- yeah, that's part of the point they're saying.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.280]   It's super interesting because this is really an EU Ireland
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.760]   issue.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.720]   And a lot of people brought up Brexit immediately
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.000]   and what it means in terms of EU versus the member nations.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.360]   And Ireland's a grown-up country and can make their own laws.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.920]   And Ireland wanted to stay in the EU, by the way.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.480]   Ireland-- yes.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.840]   So I think this is the EU flexing its muscles
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.040]   after Brexit, in effect, saying, well, you
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.320]   wanted to stay with this Ireland.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.680]   So now we have a little bit of bargaining power.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   And it is nothing new.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.320]   I mean, this has been going on for years and years
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.120]   and years, and the EU didn't do anything about it.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.440]   They said it's a three-year investigation,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.880]   but it's been going on way longer than three years.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.800]   And again, I don't know anything about Irish and EU tax law
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.080]   and Apple's corporations there.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.280]   But I have had friends who, in many situations,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   have invested in things.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.360]   And this has happened to them.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.520]   They made an investment in order to save taxes.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.680]   And they were told by their accountant that if you invest
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.520]   in this or you get this R&D tax credit or you get this,
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.120]   you put shares in this company or whatever it was.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   And then five, six years later, revenue counter door,
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.120]   revenue comeback has come back and said, that was totally illegal.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.080]   We weren't allowed to do that or we've changed the law.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.960]   And then suddenly they owe a ton of money.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.120]   And in some cases, they have absolutely no ability
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.760]   to pay that money back because they've gone on with their lives
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.200]   since then and they had budgeted.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.680]   Apple has billions and billions, hundreds of billions
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.520]   of dollars in the bank.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.000]   So they can afford to pay $14 billion.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.400]   It's relatively-- it'll hurt.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.360]   It's not a small chunk of change.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.600]   But they're insulated against severe financial hardship
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.280]   from this.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.600]   But I think it is a case where companies have been doing this
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.160]   for years.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.160]   And not just Apple.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.720]   Apple probably is the sweetest of sweetheart deals
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.400]   because of how early they got in and how big
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.080]   and how important their business was to Ireland.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.800]   But the ability to reassess these things
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.240]   the years later is something every company is going to worry
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:13.520]   about.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.400]   And there were several-- I forget who they were now,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.080]   but several Irish companies saying, what do we do next?
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.240]   I mean, we were lured to Ireland.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.160]   We were wooed.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:21.960]   And now we're worried.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.000]   We're going to be the next one who gets reassessed.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   This would be a terrible precedent.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.680]   I completely agree with Tim Cook.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.800]   And this is the most-- I mean, the EU
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.320]   has been very activist, and particularly activist,
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   against US corporations doing business in the EU.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.520]   But this is most--
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.720]   The most aggressive thing they've done and really
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.560]   quite shocking.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.200]   But Ireland-- by the way, this is not Apple's to appeal.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.360]   This is Ireland's to appeal.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.840]   They say they plan to appeal to commissions ruling.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.280]   I guess Apple says it'll do the same.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.560]   So maybe they both can.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:03.800]   And we are confident the commission's order will be reversed.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.720]   There is this larger issue of that really makes you not
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.120]   want to do business in Ireland.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.800]   Because suddenly, here comes another governing body
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.480]   that can just say, oh, by the way,
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.040]   don't listen to the gutter you're in.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.520]   We say you owe more money.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.960]   It's kind of shocking, frankly.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.080]   Yeah, it's unexpected.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.480]   I kind of-- when I heard about it this morning,
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.200]   I was thinking that, OK, well, this is another one where--
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.800]   I've been trying really hard to understand
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.320]   international business taxation for the past four months
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   since I'm getting nowhere within there.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.480]   This has been an issue for a while.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.200]   I mean, we've been talking about this a lot.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.040]   But one of the things that someone told me that kind of stuck
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.480]   out is that when you're talking about this much money
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:54.160]   and this much complexity, there is categorically right.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.880]   There is categorically wrong.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.320]   Those are the smallest bands on the spectrum.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.720]   Everything is gray.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.680]   And it depends on who will benefit
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.280]   and what kind of argument you can make about whether this
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.080]   is the right structure to use in order
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.760]   to be able to do business and to pay the least amount of taxes
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.840]   legally.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.280]   And so I assume that it was more of a gray area that
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.600]   had been sort of found.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.360]   But it looks so far as though it really was just the EU saying
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.960]   that we don't believe that Apple got the same deal
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   that any continental company would be able to get with Ireland.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.320]   So for that reason, we insist that you basically
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.400]   we level the playing field.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.880]   But again, it's like saying that you pay too little for that car.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.440]   It's only because you and the car dealer
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.480]   negotiated, decided that this $6,000 for that Buick was a good price.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.360]   We decided that you didn't pay enough money,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.400]   so you're going to have to pay an extra $12 grand.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.040]   And if you don't have it, we're going to start adding on penalties.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.560]   And I don't understand the system well enough
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:02.120]   to know if that's total BS, but that smells a bit BS.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.480]   This goes back more than 10, almost 20 years,
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.680]   to the Irish miracle.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.880]   Ireland revitalized itself, pulled off an economic miracle
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.000]   by offering low corporate taxes and other incentives
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.240]   to corporations to come to Ireland, to do business in Ireland,
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.200]   and really did, in fact, benefit Ireland.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.960]   The EU's position is that Ireland offered special treatment
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.680]   to some companies like Apple, and that was illegal.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.800]   We haven't heard from Ireland at this point.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.680]   Apple says, hey, don't blame us.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.440]   We did what Ireland told us to do.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.400]   We followed Irish law.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.200]   It does make sense, if I'm in Apple's shoes,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.520]   that this should be not applied retroactively,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.040]   if you want to change the law going forward.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.600]   And Apple has even said this, both to the US Congress and to the EU.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.680]   We do think the tax law should be reformed,
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.120]   and we would support that.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.920]   But to go back retroactively over many years and say,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.920]   oh, here's your bill, more than $14 billion,
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.400]   that's kind of shocking.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.800]   But Ireland, the real question, I guess--
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   and this will be the question for the courts--
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.320]   is did Ireland break the law in offering special deals
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.360]   to companies like Apple?
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.560]   It's all hugely strange.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.120]   And I don't think that any large company has clean hands.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.200]   I thought that Tim Cook's letter walked a very fine line
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   because he was clearly taking the position of the copy
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.840]   that we are doing.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.880]   We are fighting this.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.920]   We are opposed to this because we feel as though we're doing
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.720]   what's right.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.560]   If they felt as though they were guilty, guilty, guilty
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.760]   of doing something wrong, they would have done the three line.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.320]   We disagree with this ruling.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.840]   We intend to appeal.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.600]   We have no further comment.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.800]   But at the same time, Apple is not alone
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   in patiating certain intellectual properties
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.120]   in a Irish subsidiary or an Irish wealth company,
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.200]   even though, wait a minute, so you don't actually
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.920]   own the rights to streaming media.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.560]   That's held by a company that for no other reason
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.880]   is held in Ireland.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.960]   Yeah, I mean, I've said all along.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.920]   It's sketch.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.080]   It feels unethical.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:22.200]   It's illegal, but it's legal in the US anyway.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.280]   They're telling me in the chatroom,
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.600]   and I don't know the details of this,
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.080]   that there is a different tax rate for Apple, Google,
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.640]   and Microsoft, a few other companies
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.560]   that do this in Ireland.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.160]   They're not paying the same tax rate
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.280]   as other companies in Ireland to pay.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   That would be questionable.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.160]   But that's, again, it depends on--
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.400]   Well, it depends.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.520]   They're often exactly.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.040]   Municipalities and even United States local governments
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:50.920]   obviously have a way of saying, we know that--
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.440]   We know that--
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.920]   It's a tax rate to companies.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.360]   Newton Lower Falls is not the most attractive place
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.320]   for you to put your new Silicon Processing plan.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.880]   We want to help you to make--
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.280]   to see Newton Lower Falls is a wonderful, wonderful place
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.160]   to do business.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.600]   So that's even-- that's not necessarily
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.120]   a weird way to do business.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   Unfortunately, I might even argue against the idea of it
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.520]   being unethical for these companies
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.960]   to try to pay as little tax as possible.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.320]   So long as they're--
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.480]   I think ethical is a weird word.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.720]   But so long as they're operating within the law
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.000]   and they're not trying to have laws change to benefit them,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.680]   I have a friend of mine who won every board game as a kid we
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.040]   ever played used to have a saying that, hey, the rules
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.000]   of the game are printed right there in the middle of the bottom
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.600]   of the lid.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.240]   It's not my fault that I'm the only person who read them.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.440]   I know that I'm allowed to now turn my hotel.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.360]   It was super hotel or whatever you can do in an opt-lude.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:56.640]   And I have to say, I do knock Tim a little bit for one thing.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.680]   They always say, we pay-- we're the biggest taxpayer
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.440]   in the US.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.240]   We're the biggest taxpayer in Ireland.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.440]   We're the biggest taxpayer in the world.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.880]   That doesn't let you off the hook
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.080]   if you're still paying less taxes than you want to.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.640]   Yeah, I think Apple has learned that they
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.080]   have to litigate this stuff in the press.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.960]   I think the FBI was a big lesson for that.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.120]   And they know that Apple's a tax cheat.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   It's going to be one of the things.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.720]   Or Apple's a tax grid or a scoff law.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.760]   And they want to make sure they get out
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.080]   in front of that with messaging that is as against that
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.960]   as possible.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.880]   And one of the things that continues to impress me
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.120]   is Tim Cook seems relatively quiet,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.080]   I guess, especially compared to Tim Cook.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.840]   Tim Cook was always very fiery.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.800]   Sorry, Steve Jobs was always so fiery.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.080]   And Tim Cook is more like ice.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:40.520]   But he does these really down to earth, really well--
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.800]   it's well written well.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.400]   It's smart.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.600]   It communicates exactly.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.200]   It's smart, but it's not complicated.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.880]   He doesn't use a lot of abstracts.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.120]   He has a really good job cutting to the chase.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   And whether you disagree or disagree with this point,
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.560]   he communicates it so well in all of these letters.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.400]   Well, he has a team, obviously, of very accomplished
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.000]   people doing this.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.200]   Not a company's team.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   I know.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   I know.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.480]   Look at my hair stuff.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:09.560]   On the other hand, Ireland definitely benefited from this.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.960]   This was good economic development policy
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.560]   from the Irish point of view.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.360]   It's not like Ireland was taken advantage of.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.200]   They got a huge amount of tax revenue
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.360]   they would not have gotten otherwise.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.880]   Maybe not as much as they could have collected,
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.200]   except that Apple wouldn't be there
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   if they were paying the full rate.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.040]   So this was a conscious-- I'm sure-- a conscious decision
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.560]   on the Irish government's part.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   Look, we'll give Apple some tax breaks.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.480]   And as a result, we'll get 6,000 jobs
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.720]   and a significant tax revenue.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.400]   So they've benefited from this.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.760]   And it was strategically a good move for them.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.040]   In fact, you might characterize this as a win-win for everybody.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.400]   For the EU to come in and retroactively say, ah, ah,
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   and here, give us $14 billion.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.600]   That's a lot of money.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.160]   It's like-- it's good for Ireland.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.280]   I mean, it would not be good for the EU.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.320]   And they may not want member nations making sweetheart deals.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.560]   But that's where people who voted for Brexit
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.960]   might reasonably say, you see?
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.680]   You see?
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.320]   No taxation without representation.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.160]   There you go.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:11.560]   Yeah, you can't--
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.040]   You can't deny that Apple and these companies
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.520]   have done more for the Irish economy and the Irish people
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.320]   than, say, the DeLorean company did.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.800]   And then more for Ireland, they did for Wales.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.240]   Well, they wailed it off for them a better deal.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:26.440]   Right.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.360]   Save the Wales.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.800]   Save the Wales, Apple.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.880]   All right, wait.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.840]   This will be a story that we'll go on for years and years
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.720]   and years and years.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.080]   For years.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.280]   I think Bloomberg was quoted as saying three years
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.560]   for the appeal process.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.360]   So we'll meet back for the iPhone 10 event and talk about this.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.760]   Well, like I tweeted this morning,
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.280]   I go to bed every night praying and dreaming
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.200]   that I'm going to spend the entire morning rereading
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.040]   about international tax law.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.560]   I'm living the dream.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.760]   Well, and I have to say, I've been so excited about the new Planet
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.760]   of the Apps TV show.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   I'm on the other day.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.600]   Every day.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.160]   Every day we've got Winath Paltrow.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.080]   We've got Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.160]   And now the newest mentor for these great app developers
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.960]   are going to be making the most amazing apps in the world.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.120]   Jessica Alba.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.840]   I'm just waiting for you to live tweet this the way
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.640]   Christina Warren does.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.480]   It's the bachelor.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.600]   I think that would be phenomenal.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.760]   Now, I have to be--
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.800]   let's be fair because Jessica Alba, of course,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.360]   known as a movie star.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.120]   But in fact, she did start a company, quite a successful
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.200]   company called the Honest Company, and has done well with it.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.000]   And now I don't know how involved in the business she is.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.840]   But from all appearances, she's quite an accomplished business
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.340]   person.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:44.760]   So maybe I'm just being bigoted by saying, really,
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.080]   a mentor and advisor.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.560]   Get Kim Kardashian on there.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.840]   She's made more money than that purchase and almost anybody.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.880]   Please.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.040]   Especially-- well, I would love it if they were honest
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.600]   and saying that, well, your problem
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.520]   is that you're trying to sell the product.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.640]   What you really need is to try to trick
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.680]   the people who have very, very low chemical brain
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.560]   resistance to be able to resist offers
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.000]   and hit them with psychologically the worst offer
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.560]   at the best possible time.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.600]   You see, also, between the hours of 330 and 430,
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.960]   a lot of children have access to iOS devices
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.800]   but are not being well supervised.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.600]   So here's a comment to the 9 to 5 Mac story
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.120]   that I thought-- I don't know.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.280]   I went, oh, my wife and I, Joseph Quinn, writes,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.480]   my wife and I submitted our app Pilates Metrics
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.280]   to plan it to the apps.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.640]   Can't wait to hear their selections.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.120]   Friday was the last day.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.480]   By the way, you're competing for $10 million investment,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.800]   not from Apple, but from light speed venture partners.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.440]   We've been working on Pilates Metrics for two years
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.360]   and are currently in beta.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.840]   Our app allows Pilates professionals
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.360]   to track chart and share clients' progress
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.680]   by building a de-identified database
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.640]   for various pre-existing conditions.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.120]   Well, good luck to you, Joseph.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.960]   And maybe Gwyneth Paltrow is a Pilates--
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.680]   Is it going to be like the voice where they spin around
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   in their chairs and take an app?
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.440]   I kind of like that.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.800]   Boom.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   I want an app for an app.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   I don't want to be that guy.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.720]   Like, my every instinct is like, this is terrible.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.520]   How could they do this?
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.800]   How could they cast these people?
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.560]   But I represent such a narrow field of interest.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.000]   And I never want to say that, you know, my judgment
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.600]   is the right one.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.320]   There might be millions and millions of people
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.600]   for whom these are the perfect hosts for the perfect thing.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.800]   And I'm just a curmudgeonly old technologist who wants
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.400]   all these new fangled mainstream technologists off this one.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.480]   We twit piloted a reality series called--
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.160]   what was it?
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.080]   I'd fund that.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.000]   It was kind of a shark tank for crowdfunding.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.320]   And we brought in people.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.000]   They demoed it.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.160]   And then the panel of judges, of which I was one,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.200]   would say either I'd fund that or go fund yourself.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.440]   And--
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.600]   Which I thought was clever.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.920]   That was probably the best part of the show.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.480]   App tank.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.040]   And the reason we stopped is because I finally--
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   I made somebody cry.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.320]   I said, I can-- this is horrible.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.400]   I can't do this.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.960]   I'm not going to sit in judgment on people.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.280]   And then nobody else would do it.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   So--
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.560]   So we couldn't do the show because nobody wanted to be that jerk.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.400]   Nobody wanted to be Simon Cowell.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400]   You need to British Accently.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.320]   We've proven nothing else on television,
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.120]   whether it's the-- you're the weakest link.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.400]   If you're Simon Cowell, if you're Gordon Ramsay,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.160]   you can be mean as long as you have a British Accent.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.560]   Yeah, and somehow softens the blow.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.080]   And frankly, I think that that's a valuable service.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   Somebody does need to be blunt and say, you can't sing.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.600]   I just don't want to be that one.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.080]   You can't app.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.320]   Donnie, you're not really being kind to people.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.720]   You're not giving them honest feedback.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.320]   I know.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:40.600]   But I--
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.160]   Thanks, Steve.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:41.880]   I know.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.320]   I know.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:42.960]   But I can't.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.240]   I would never have survived under Mr. Jobs.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.600]   I just-- I can't.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.120]   I have to be nice.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.080]   Anyway, it would have been a great show,
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.160]   but couldn't bring myself to do it.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:53.480]   I just--
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.520]   Alba's going to make him cry.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.440]   Yeah, I don't see her doing that.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.520]   That's Gary Vee's job.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.200]   Dark Angel made me cry.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.120]   Clearly, Gary Vee is there.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.640]   Pepper Potts made me cry.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.080]   By the way, Tim Cook's doing OK, five years in office.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.160]   I don't understand this word from the register.co.uk,
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.800]   some sort of Britishism.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.600]   Tim Cook trousers, 135 million in apple shares.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.080]   I think that--
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.880]   Well, that's a grown-up.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.480]   That means pocket, right?
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.000]   It's a wrong trousers, grown-up.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.440]   You put it in your trousers, grown-up.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:25.960]   When's the thing?
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.760]   And the wrong trousers, grown-up.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.840]   And I've gone wrong.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.760]   1.26 million shares.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.480]   He immediately sold them for $36 million.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.000]   This is--
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.200]   Give me charity.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.080]   Did he?
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.200]   Well, no, but he's giving all his money to charity, so--
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.160]   He sold $36 million worth of shares,
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.320]   forfeited $71 million for taxes.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.080]   And I don't know.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.760]   It says, kept holding the rain.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.920]   Only you lived in Ireland.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.200]   There's something going on there,
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.280]   because that math does not work out.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280]   The original deal was for 1 million shares,
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.720]   but it turned into 7 million shares, thanks
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.280]   to the stock split, as you know, the 7-for-1 stocks split.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.080]   So nice, nice.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.560]   He only--
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.080]   Or give Lee Apple wants to retain him.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.800]   The register says, Cook shares are a critical income
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.200]   stream for the CEO, because he only
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.080]   makes $10 million a year in salary.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:24.800]   OK.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.640]   I guess he really--
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.760]   He has percentage of revenue.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.680]   It's probably not the highest in the industry.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.240]   Can he really claim to be 10 million times more
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.600]   viable to the company than Steve Jobs?
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.120]   Really not, man.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:34.320]   That's right.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.680]   Jobs only took a dollar, didn't he?
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.400]   But then he had a corporate jet.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.000]   Let's not forget.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.320]   And believe you me, he paid all the taxes on that dollar.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.840]   I liked it Tim Cook's interview that we talked about last week
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.480]   and what she said.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.880]   Well, I haven't flown commercial in some time,
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.040]   but as I remember--
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.560]   I liked it when he said that he'd made mistakes,
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.160]   and he was very forthright in what he thought that he'd done.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.400]   And you don't always get that.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.520]   Sometimes you get really good marketing spin.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.000]   You know what?
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   That was kind of a question.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   For all of what we say about Tim Cook, both good and bad,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.400]   there's no question.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.920]   He is a wonderful human being, and gets a lot of credit
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.280]   just for being a great human being.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.680]   And really, in the long run, that's
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.080]   the most important thing, right?
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.040]   He's a great human.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:16.880]   And he's very forthright.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.800]   Like, it seems to me that I've had a rare opportunity
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.120]   to speak to him, and he comes across exactly the way he does
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:22.800]   on stage.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   Yeah, genuine.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.760]   Yeah, me too.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.440]   I've been in the time that I was in a social situation
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.600]   with Tim Cook was informed by the time I was
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.000]   in a social situation.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.120]   He's almost the exact same sort of social situation
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   with Steve Jobs and Tim.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.640]   And those five or 10 minutes, so much nicer, so much sweeter,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.000]   so much more human.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.880]   I have no insight knowledge of how Steve behaved
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.960]   to when he was not in a public setting.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.240]   But that was like, this is nicer.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.000]   I didn't want to say, Tim, you're so much nicer
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.680]   than the other guy.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.640]   Thank you.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.760]   We also-- there's some debate about what
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.040]   we're going to see Wednesday in terms of watches.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.160]   And I-- an Apple Watch 2, we think,
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.320]   with more battery and a GPS.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.080]   And those cancel out.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.520]   So it's the same battery life.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.840]   And a new really, really thick watch band, for some reason.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   And I really, really, really want new MacBook Pros,
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   at least announce them.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.120]   So we know, you know, OK, we can wait a month or two,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.760]   but at least announce them.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.280]   And I see it go back and forth.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.120]   Ming-Chi Kuo was saying this quarter.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.040]   And then others have said, oh, no, won't be till next quarter.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.080]   I think it'll be soon, but I just--
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.560]   the Apple has never-- and not never is a long time.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.680]   But in recent memory, Apple has had I've pod
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.840]   and iPhone events in September.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.960]   And they have been willing to share those
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.360]   with other iOS devices.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.240]   Like last year, there was the iPad Pro and the Apple TV
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.040]   at the same time.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040]   They didn't do it.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:58.640]   They didn't do it.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.320]   But no Macs.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.640]   They were no Macs in September.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.000]   The Mac update was the high-color gamut iMac.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.680]   And that was done in a press release later in the year.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.760]   And it's possible that Apple would change that.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.880]   But it just seems unlikely because they want all that attention
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.160]   to go on the iPhone.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.680]   And then maybe they'll do media briefings,
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.480]   or they'll do a press release, or they'll do a small venue
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.160]   show, which they've tried to shy away
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.040]   from last year.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.920]   They didn't do one.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.000]   They suggested that Town Hall, which
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.200]   is the venue inside One Infinite Loop,
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.040]   was going to be used for the last time at the March event.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.520]   So it's really hard to tell.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.080]   But my best guess is that we'll get Macs after this event
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:33.880]   and not at it.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.240]   I must--
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.400]   Go ahead.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.200]   That's what I've been hearing.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.720]   And then Mark Gurman--
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.240]   That's what I was just about to say.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.080]   So that's--
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.760]   I was puzzled, though, because he also
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.480]   said new 5K displays.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.360]   Also later.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.160]   That does not seem likely.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.840]   I'll be honest.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.480]   What do you need a 5K display for?
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.400]   It's the same way when the original IPS iMac came out.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.720]   Apple, as soon as they could, took that panel
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   and put it into a standalone, the Thunderbolt story.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.440]   But that's when they were still selling desktop PCs.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.360]   I don't think they're in the desktop PC market anymore.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.200]   Yeah, but they have people who have Mac Pros,
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.840]   and they want just an Apple display for them.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.200]   They don't care about people who have Mac Pros, all--
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.480]   No, inside Apple.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.760]   And they have MacBook Pros, and they have Mac Pros,
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.120]   and they want to dock them to something.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.920]   And if that has a sound--
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.360]   How big is that dock market?
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.880]   Because, either wise--
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.280]   Tiny, tiny, tiny.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.680]   Most people don't use this for all the--
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.800]   There is no market for a 5K cinema display.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.400]   No.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.680]   There's very little market for a Mac Pro.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.680]   It's one of those things where--
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.320]   Mac, many of these aren't sold to--
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.640]   you're sold to reuse your old display.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.200]   Absolutely.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.120]   But it feels like one of those things
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.880]   where Apple just wants to have it the way that some car
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.120]   companies want to have that hypercar at the top of the lineup.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.880]   It's just aspirational as part of the brand.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   It has their logo on it.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.320]   Also, the generations of Intel chips
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.680]   are going to basically give away 4K for free.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.480]   Stuff that used to be really, really hard,
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.320]   and needed some special engineering is now basically--
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.880]   It's like the time that they did a CPU upgrade,
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.040]   and suddenly everyone got two hours of battery life.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.240]   Not because of something super fancy,
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   but because here's something you get for free by switching
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.000]   this new CPU.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.480]   Maybe part of it is Apple realizing that we want to be able to
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.280]   exceptionally take advantage of the fact
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.200]   that we will be shipping Mac Pros next to your say
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.160]   that will effortlessly be able to stream 4K and effortlessly
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.720]   be able to deal with to edit other 4K stuff.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.880]   It's interesting that there are only two--
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.320]   if I'm not mistaken, there are only two devices in Apple's
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.840]   whole product line that can edit 4K video elegantly.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.000]   One of those is the top of the-- absolutely top of the line.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.400]   Mac Pro and the other is the iPad Pro 12.9 machine.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.840]   And mid-range Mac books are not really set up to do that,
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.720]   but these two other machines are very optimized
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.280]   for that kind of presentation.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.840]   So I don't know.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.760]   It's like routers, Leo.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.200]   I mean, it's not like they changed them much.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.560]   I think the last one was on the market for four or five years
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.480]   in the airport, so on the market for a long time,
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.920]   it's just it's a peripheral for people who will absolutely
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.200]   want to have it with an Apple.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.160]   I don't know if Apple's ever going to do another router.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.600]   That's like they have an update that thing ever.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.200]   Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.400]   It's too bad because they could do something exceptional.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.040]   It's always such a huge pain point for everything.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.360]   And the ability to simply say, we got this.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.080]   Don't worry about it.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.960]   We will do port forwarding for you automatically.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.560]   We will have it every time that there is any kind of--
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.360]   any cable company that has more than eight subscribers,
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.920]   we will figure out what hardware they use,
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.520]   and we will make sure that our device will work absolutely
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.280]   constantly with your device.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.320]   It's still just a nightmare every time that--
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.360]   I start to twitch a little bit, even
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.760]   when I'm going to put in a new light bulb.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.840]   OK, will it be able to--
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.840]   well, I have to bring this lamp into the other room
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.280]   to make sure it can see the Wi-Fi network just
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.360]   so I can set it up before I--
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.640]   God, I'd much rather just use a flashlight.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.480]   There are people, though, there are companies like Euro
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:05.760]   and Plume and Luma that are really leaping ahead of Apple
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.520]   technology.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.400]   And there's more to come.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.240]   That's just the first wave of the whole new concept
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.440]   of routers of Wi-Fi.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.960]   And it's so important, because when you see all the--
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.240]   there was rumors for a while that Apple was building
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.600]   this next generation box that would also--
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.640]   it would pre-download all your software updates.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.560]   It would cache iCloud for you.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.080]   It would do all these smart things.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.120]   And now you see--
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.720]   I've been looking at the HomeKit stuff,
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.880]   because I want to get more of it.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.240]   And when you see someone say, movie time,
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.200]   and the blinds come down, and the lights dim and turn
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.600]   a different shade color, and the television comes on,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.520]   and the fan goes to whisper quiet.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.640]   When you see what you can do, and this stuff really,
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.840]   it works well in your home.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.000]   It's just so compelling.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.760]   Actually, to that, to the man--
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.080]   Go ahead.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.440]   Hey, are you in the same situation
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.040]   that I've often been in where it's like, I have guests over,
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.800]   and I'm about to just give a voice command,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.000]   because we're about to say something.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.960]   Then I realized that, no, I really
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.200]   want to start watching this movie in five minutes.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.640]   If I reach over and manually turn these things off,
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.800]   we can watch the movie.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.600]   If I do it--
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.720]   no, I'm saying, if I do it automatically,
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.240]   I'm going to spend 30 minutes demonstrating this system
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.560]   to people, and I just want to watch the movie with these people.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.240]   I never even thought of that at such a good point.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.120]   There are some people who want to demonstrate,
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.400]   and there are some people who want to watch,
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.520]   and you're a watcher.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.000]   Actually, to that end, real quickly,
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.640]   before we take a break, Sonos is just
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.240]   an out-of-bigh announcement this morning,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.560]   in which they say, starting sometime next year,
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.240]   they're going to work with Amazon's Echo.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.760]   Yay.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:39.560]   That put a big old smile on my face.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.680]   And private.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.400]   Dave, Amazon can screw a lot of things up,
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.280]   but once they get a hit, they know how
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.960]   to keep prosecuting that advantage.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.160]   There's a lot of people.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.640]   Even Google with Google Home, they're going to have a lot
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.360]   to catch up with.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.040]   Oh, kidding.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.840]   No kidding.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.600]   Wired has the story, if you want to read about Sonos'
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.080]   announcements, some very exciting stuff,
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.160]   especially for those of us who have invested heavily.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.600]   In the Sonos.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.920]   Oh, Lord, have I spent a lot of time?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.160]   By the way, LG is the rumor, German's rumor,
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:18.520]   is that LG will work with Apple on that new 5K screen.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.520]   So it may be an LG product.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:21.960]   Who knows?
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:27.080]   I just can't-- it's not a big business for Apple.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   On the other hand, if LG sells it and it works with other--
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.680]   it could be a new product line for Apple.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.680]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.040]   for the digitally literate.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.520]   This is a great new product from Quick and Loans.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.120]   Of course, they're the best loan broker, mortgage loan operator
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.560]   in the United States.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.720]   And I know everybody knows about Quick and Loans.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.280]   But I think Quick and Loans realizes
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.960]   that there are a lot of you, especially people
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:55.080]   watching this show, who don't want to do the mortgage loan,
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.680]   the home loan route in the old fashioned way.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.920]   And that's still how it's done.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.960]   I remember three years ago when we got our loan for our house.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.440]   When you go to the mortgage broker,
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.800]   he still has a clipped together sheaf of paper
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.880]   that gets printed out every day with the rates.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.280]   And he thumbs through the rates.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.120]   Licks his fingers.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.960]   He might as well have a green eye shade and a wrist garter.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.920]   I mean, sleeve garters.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.960]   Because I mean, it's like an equil pen.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.520]   Well, let me check the rates for you.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.080]   Rocket mortgage is so nice.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.040]   First of all, no trips to the mortgage broker.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.720]   You do it all from the comfort of your home.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.040]   In fact, even the comfort of your couch,
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.520]   because it works with a phone or an iPad,
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.880]   as well as your computer.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.960]   You send them all the documentation they need directly,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.040]   digitally, your bank statements, your pay steps.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.960]   It's so easy.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.440]   And of course, because it's all automated and computerized,
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.400]   they can get you approved in minutes
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.600]   with a custom solution that's tailored
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.880]   for your financial situation.

[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.360]   30.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   I was talking to, who was it, Brad Sam?
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360]   Somebody, one of our contributors just bought a house
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.560]   using Rocket Mortgage.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.360]   You could refi, you could buy.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.120]   And he said, so the whole thing's online.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.000]   And you don't even have to go to sign the papers.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.920]   They send the notary and you do it all at your house.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.960]   That could not be easy.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.720]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.960]   It's quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.720]   We thank you for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.000]   We've been talking about Wednesday
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.320]   and how exciting Wednesday is going to be.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.680]   Absolutely watch.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.600]   So it sounded like your thinking, Renee, is October.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.800]   We have another announcement for these news.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.040]   Yeah, there is, again, like, whether it's just media briefings,
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.720]   whether it's press releases.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.520]   Well, yeah, it seems like the product's going to need
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.440]   some explanation though.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.920]   So I think it will be something more than just--
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.920]   Are they close enough to the Cooper team
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.720]   new campus that they could actually have it there
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.960]   and if it were a couple months from now?
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.360]   I don't think so.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.360]   No, no, that's not what I've heard.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.800]   You, public service announcement, you have updated your iOS.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.200]   Certainly, you have by now.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.880]   We've been saying this all week.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:32.400]   iOS 935 patches, serious, serious security flaws in iOS.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.320]   And the story about these is actually really, really annoying.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.880]   Turns out these zero-day flaws have been known for some time.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.200]   They were discovered, we believe, by a company called the NSO
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:47.600]   Group.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.480]   It was an Israeli company, but currently owned
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.400]   by a private equity firm in the US Francisco partners.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.600]   They found it.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.920]   We don't know exactly when.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.960]   And instead of telling Apple and protecting us all,
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.600]   or letting Apple protect us all, they held onto it
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.200]   and sold it to the highest bidder.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.320]   If you go to the NSO Group site, they say, well, we only
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.200]   will sell to legally constituted entities.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.640]   We don't sell to bad guys.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.320]   But that could be any government anywhere.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.160]   And in this case, it looks like these zero-day flaws
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.960]   were sold to the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, who
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.800]   used them to target a dissident who has been arrested many times
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.040]   in the UAE, Ahmed Mansoor.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.960]   He's been jailed.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.080]   He's been targeted in the past with commercial malware.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.000]   He is smart enough to know when he gets a text message
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.920]   with a link not to click on it.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.120]   I wish we were all that smart.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.280]   Instead, these text messages came, I think, last month in July.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.520]   He forwarded them over to a really good group in Toronto
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.480]   that does the work of the Angels, Citizen Lab.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.120]   It's at the University of Toronto's Munk School
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.920]   of Global Affairs.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.280]   And they looked into it and they said, this is a new zero day.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.080]   That if you had followed that link,
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.640]   you would have been infected with malware that would have not
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.120]   only taken over your iPhone, but given them full access
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.360]   to the camera, the microphone, the GPS,
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.160]   it would be the ultimate hack.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.080]   They, thank you Citizen Lab, told Apple.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.520]   And Apple, within 10 days, had a fix.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.280]   They put that fix out as 935.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.400]   It's also apparently baked into the releases for iOS 10,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.120]   if you're a beta tester.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:28.800]   So you're safe.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.240]   But if you have an updated update,
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.440]   because there are already reports of other people,
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.320]   other bad actors, not governments going after distance,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.920]   but bad guys using this.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's-- there's zero to exploits.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.040]   There were three of them, one that allowed them--
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.680]   like there's a phishing attack that allowed them
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.640]   if you clicked on the link to get on the phone.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.780]   And then they could escalate and basically do a remote jail
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.040]   break.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.000]   They could jailbreak your iPhone from afar.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   We've seen that in the past.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.440]   It was a version of the original iPhone
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.120]   that could be jailbroken by loading a TIFF image
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.360]   into the Safari browser.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.280]   So these things, once in a while, exist.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.320]   As long as humans have access to a system
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.800]   and are coding a system, they'll once in a while
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.040]   be these sorts of exploits.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.120]   And they're called zero day because nobody knew about them
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.840]   until they were discovered quote unquote in the wild.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.760]   And publicized, yeah.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.800]   Yeah, and publicized.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.080]   And the only thing you can do with this
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.000]   is judge a company by how well they react that.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.200]   And in the past, Apple hasn't always
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.040]   reacted well to the discovery of zero days.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.280]   But this is a whole new era for Apple security.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.880]   I mean, there's the bug bounty now.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.680]   And they have very good red teams at Apple, very good security
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.560]   teams who just pounce on this stuff.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.320]   In 10 days, it's a pretty good--
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.840]   because when you patch a bug, there's
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.240]   a whole bunch of repercussions.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.160]   Because you don't know-- there was a famous example
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.880]   of Safari where they patched a Safari bug.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.240]   And so many things have been coded to rely on that bug
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.040]   that it just broke so many other things.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.320]   And sometimes release an update.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.640]   And it creates a worse problem than the bug.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.200]   They have to test all these things as well.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.000]   So it's an incredible urgency.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.720]   But you have to brace that urgency with getting
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.320]   a really good patch out there.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.120]   And it seems in this case, they did it.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.360]   So the original exploit isn't anything most people
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.120]   have to worry about.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.560]   It was a exploit sold to a nation state
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   to use against dissidents or journalists who cover dissidents.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.680]   But once it's reported and is out there,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.160]   there are people who will take these exploits
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.760]   and try to prey on people who they think have an update.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.960]   So the minute it is disclosed and the update is out,
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.840]   you really have to patch that immediately.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.120]   You have to update immediately.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.680]   By the way, the argument for companies
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.480]   that discover these-- immediately getting them to Apple
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.320]   is the longer these exploits sit undiscovered,
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.160]   the more likely somebody else will find them.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:25.640]   If the NSO--
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.680]   Somebody could have had this first.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.880]   Somebody could have had it before NSO
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.840]   and never been discovered.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.480]   Right.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.640]   Somebody bad.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.480]   I mean, arguably, I'd say NSO group is bad.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.680]   And the UAE government that's using is bad.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.200]   Absolutely.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.560]   But a hacker could use it against you.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.760]   The thing that you can say as well, at least we're not
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:45.240]   being targeted by the UAE.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.800]   This is just immoral.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.600]   There's certainly financially lucrative,
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.640]   and there are a lot of businesses based on this.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.480]   But it's just immoral.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.880]   Chris Seguayan, who's great.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.560]   He's a South Seguayan's brother.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.120]   We all know Sal from Apple Talk.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:58.800]   I mean--
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.280]   Automator.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:20:59.800]   Apple script.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.160]   --apples script.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.800]   And Automator.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:06.040]   His brother works at the ACLU as a security expert there.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   Quote, "Government use of malware and the stockpiling
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.520]   of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.920]   It's not like terrorists are using different phones
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.640]   from the rest of us.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.120]   So it just jeopardizes all of us when companies find something
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.160]   and they don't reveal it to Apple.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.120]   And this isn't going to stop."
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.480]   And they're paying a fortune.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.840]   I had a chance to talk to Apple about the security things.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.680]   And they are offering a really good bug bounty program.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.360]   But there are nation states, and there
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.080]   are groups that are offering millions of dollars.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.240]   There's nothing.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.960]   Compared to the million-- again, you
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.920]   don't want to create a bidding war where all you do
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.360]   is inflate the price of these things.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.680]   And there's different people are researching these
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   for noble reasons, and the ones who are researching these
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.280]   for malevolent reasons.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.400]   So you're dealing with a completely different audience.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.440]   But it just shows how valuable.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.880]   Forget what-- in the end result was of how much the FBI
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.880]   paid for their exploit.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   But it wasn't--
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   We guessed it was a million.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.680]   We guessed it was a million because Comey, the director of the FBI,
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.880]   said it was more than my yearly salary.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.560]   And I think that the--
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.840]   And it gives you an idea of how valuable that is to them
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.200]   because you don't get many shots with it,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.520]   because somebody will discover it and close it.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.040]   There's nothing-- I mean, this isn't going to stop.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.600]   There's too much money at stake.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.200]   There's too many people who are willing to do this.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.600]   I guess it behooves Apple to get as many people
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.000]   as they can working on security flaws.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.440]   It also, frankly, puts the burden on all companies
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.440]   who make software to do a better job
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.000]   and try to make it more secure.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.680]   It's very hard.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.920]   There's no such thing as perfect software.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.120]   And they're trying to do things on the operate.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.120]   You want to have defense in depth where--
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.400]   there's new things in iOS 10.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.320]   If you haven't watched it already,
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.480]   I recommend that it last week.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.600]   But Ivan Kritzak's talk from Black Hat was remarkable.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.440]   They're doing a lot of things to randomize
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.600]   where they put things in memory.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.840]   They're trying to harden JavaScript
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.520]   because JavaScript is always an increasing target
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.920]   for these kinds of things.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.040]   And we had that incident.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.600]   I think it was last year where people were linking
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.840]   to a common open source library that came from China.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.400]   It turned out to have a bunch of bad things in it.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.720]   So the amount of scrutiny you need to put,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.600]   even on things you think are going to help you code better
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.680]   in faster apps for your customers is only increasing.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.080]   So again, the bottom line, update.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:16.600]   Update.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.880]   And don't click on links that you get an email or what is it?
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.920]   And by the way, I've been fished, too.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.440]   That's a very common phishing scam
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.920]   to get a text message to your phone.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:28.240]   The one that I got said, this is Apple.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.360]   And we found your phone and log in to find my iPhone
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.400]   to find out where it is.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.040]   And the link looked like "Find My iPhone."
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.400]   Henry had just lost his phone in Barcelona.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.240]   So I clicked it and started logging into what looked
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.040]   like iCloud.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.600]   It was an iCloud, unfortunately.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.320]   I stopped myself realizing my mistake.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:47.680]   But that's--
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.920]   It happened to me with Twitter.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   Twitter link is that reset.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.960]   You have to do something with your DMs.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.400]   So really, we care--
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.600]   also, not only that, but be super, super, super careful.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.320]   Because a lot of the cleverness of these targeted emails
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.760]   is that knowing that we're sending out
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.840]   a million of these emails.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.080]   So if we say that, hey, we found the problem of why
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.160]   our thermostat has--
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.680]   I'm from the power company.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.440]   We figured out why your thermostat keeps acting up.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.560]   You're going to find that one person that, oh, wow,
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.360]   that's great.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.560]   They finally answered the customer service thing
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.080]   that I filed two weeks ago.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.280]   They know that the law of average
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.480]   says that they will get someone who will click that without question
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.920]   because it's not a misspelled email from a bank
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.200]   that they don't do any business with.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.400]   It's from their power company that they accidentally got to.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.960]   So you really have to train yourself--
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.600]   a muscle memory that says that I will never
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.920]   click a link inside an email.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.520]   If I get a warning from Apple about something,
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.360]   I'm then going to simply nod.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.240]   I'm going to tab over to my web browser.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.840]   I'm going to type in apple.com directly.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.280]   And I'm going to check my billing statements directly
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.440]   from there.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.400]   Jason Snow was on a tweet on Sunday.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.840]   He talked about his article on Macworld.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.960]   "Apple music is so good.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.480]   I'm totally trapped because I've bought--
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.480]   there's so much music on it."
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.200]   Apple music-- he's already--
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.920]   I've been a paying Apple music subscriber for a year now.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.640]   He loves the discovery.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.520]   But more than that, it's saving him a lot of money,
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.960]   although one must ask how the music industry would
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.480]   be if some of that money were spent on buying CDs
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.200]   instead of just subscribing to them.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:26.680]   I don't know.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.920]   I don't know the answer to that one.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.600]   We can look at Spotify's profits and see how profitable
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.480]   streaming music is.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.760]   So that's where this leads.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.680]   Because of course, then there were also stories this week
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.880]   about Spotify burying musicians who
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.800]   made Apple exclusive deals, not promoting them,
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.880]   not putting them on charts, not letting
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.320]   you know about their music.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.360]   This seems unlikely.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.720]   And in fact, Spotify denies it saying, well, you know,
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.840]   that would disadvantage our customers.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.880]   But Drake chanced the rapper in Frank Ocean, all three
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.800]   of whom have exclusive deals for Apple music.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:09.080]   Supposedly, their representatives aren't saying,
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.400]   because that would be very in politic,
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.960]   but are getting less promotion on Spotify
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.360]   because of their relationship.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.880]   One representative Bloomberg says of a singer-songwriter
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.720]   said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Zane
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.240]   Lowe's Apple radio service Beats One
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.960]   because of concern that that would cost promotion
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.160]   from Spotify.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.560]   The agent and artist, of course, didn't want to be named.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:36.240]   That's not new.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.200]   They were rival record stores that would put you
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.120]   on the top shelf or put your album behind the Roger Whitaker
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.520]   songs if you didn't give it to somebody else.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.920]   Spotify, I think, also--
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.160]   --the payments understand that this, you know,
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160]   discovery is important to its customers.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.840]   And so they do this at their peril.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.440]   And it comes up in so many different ways to Apple's big deal
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.680]   is that we don't have--
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.400]   we don't have mindless algorithms that are selecting
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:01.880]   our playlist.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.320]   We have actually human beings who are curating things.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.840]   And how bad does a situation get before someone says,
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.520]   we need-- you need to have machines pick the playlist
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.920]   or else we'll think that the people are corrupt.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.960]   And they're being paid off by record companies
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.240]   and by different labels.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.280]   How do you solve that problem?
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.320]   It's costing, at least according to music business worldwide,
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.800]   it's costing Spotify and its deals with the labels.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.200]   It's out of contract with all three major record labels.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.800]   They're trying to get a better deal,
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.160]   trying to be profitable, right?
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.000]   Because Spotify is far from profitable.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.840]   It's a hard business.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.040]   I mean, I've said this in my coverage of this
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.080]   that there's just not much money to be made in streaming music.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.960]   The profits are so razor thin that I
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.560]   think it's going to end up being a value added business
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.200]   that companies like Google and Facebook and Apple offer
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.080]   to enrich their platform experience
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.600]   because they can afford it not quite as a loss leader,
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.800]   but it's something that really isn't
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.600]   designed to make a huge amount of money.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:05.160]   Music business worldwide says that Spotify was paying less.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.360]   They had a sweetheart deal with the record labels, much like Apple
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.440]   had with Ireland.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.080]   That the Swedish streamer continues to pay a revenue share
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.600]   of 55% to labels, not including publishing money.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.400]   That's less than the 60% audio paid.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.200]   Of course, audio is out of business now.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.720]   The reason that those early contracts were set up that way
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.360]   is because Daniel X said the CEO of Spotify,
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.640]   this is going to benefit you will promote Spotify.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.800]   And I think he makes a good point.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.880]   Spotify is the modern radio.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.600]   But now here comes Apple Music, all of a sudden,
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.520]   with actual radio.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.760]   And now you see the smarts behind Jimmy Iovine's plans
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.360]   to do Beats 1.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.440]   It's the service.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.280]   I mean, look how many companies Google's left in their wake
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.280]   because they can afford to give away services that were
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.040]   extremely costly for companies who only did that service.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.480]   I mean, look at what Blackberry used
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.720]   to charge for messaging and all sorts of things.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.800]   Supposedly, I'm going to trust music business worldwide.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.680]   This is their beat.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.360]   Apple pays 58%.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.760]   Little more than Spotify, a little less than RDO did.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.680]   And the reason that there hasn't been a deal yet
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.720]   with Spotify is the majors want to pay
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:23.960]   to Spotify to pay them 58% as well.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.880]   And of course, Spotify says, hey, we can't.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.040]   We're losing money.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.000]   So we'd like to get it down below 50%.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.600]   Spotify denies this.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.680]   Remember, there's also publishing royalties
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.360]   according to MBW 13 and a half to 15% of revenue
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.840]   depending on the region, which is,
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.240]   Apple's also paying more than Spotify in that regard.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.360]   So we've said this all along.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.480]   I really worry about Spotify.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.320]   I love Spotify.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.240]   I am a subscriber.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.800]   I finally did the thing I should have done all along,
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.880]   which is cancel my Apple subscription,
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.560]   which is more to Spotify through Apple,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.320]   which is three bucks more a month.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:08.360]   And now I'm after resub, it's just a pain,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.240]   but you have to go to Spotify and resubscribe through them.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.960]   I'll spend $3 less.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:19.440]   Spotify posted in 2015, $194 million loss.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.680]   84% of its $2 billion revenue went out
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.080]   to royalty distribution and other costs.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.960]   They just, it is not a business at this point.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.360]   - And we have to pay to, I mean, Apple,
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.080]   I don't want to say Apple's development of Apple music
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.960]   is free, I mean, like the actual technical development
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.760]   of it, but they're a company that does nothing
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.640]   besides making services and apps where Spotify is a,
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.680]   sharing music and whether that's to invest in making apps
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.520]   and making all these other things.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:45.440]   It's hard to be concerned.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.840]   - So you can see why Spotify is fighting hard,
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.960]   doing whatever they can, but frankly,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.280]   I think it's inevitably a losing battle.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.600]   - It's hard to figure out where it's gonna break.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.240]   You have a streaming company like Spotify
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.240]   that can't make any money.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.000]   You've got artists who don't feel as though
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.360]   they're being compensated enough for their work.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.080]   And you've even got publishing companies
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.640]   that are willing to describe streaming as something
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.480]   that's gonna, that's basically killing their entire industry.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.640]   You can't really name anybody that is really, really happy
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.360]   with a consumer's switch to streaming
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.680]   and subscription music services over payment services.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.320]   - Is it good if Spotify goes under,
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.600]   is that good for the record business?
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.440]   - Or they get bought, I mean,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.240]   with Facebook, they'll buy them or somebody
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.240]   and then they'll have, it's just really hard
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.000]   to be a single revenue company these days
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.480]   in technology at any scale,
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.920]   because if you don't have Anseli revenue,
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.320]   you're so subject to ups and downs in the market.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.280]   It's what broke Palm, it's what broke Blackberry,
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.040]   and that was hardware, but it's just really tough.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.680]   - Yeah, it's also a dangerous proposition because just,
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.400]   if all that Facebook wants to have a music service
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.640]   because that's one of the few things they don't have
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.000]   when they're trying to get into a hockey stick fight
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.480]   against Apple and Microsoft and Google.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.040]   But it's also the idea of realizing that the more data
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.600]   they have, the more data they can exploit.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.160]   And there are a lot of people that have never given
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.560]   their phone number or other personal details.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:11.000]   They get bothered every time they log on to Facebook.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.520]   So, hey, your profile is only 20% complete.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.560]   Why don't you confirm this, that, and the other?
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.080]   But once they buy Spotify,
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.320]   now they have access to all of that account data.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.160]   Guess what?
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.160]   Now I have your, now I have your cell phone number
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.680]   and now I can compare that cell phone number
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   to the customer databases, the contact databases
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.080]   of all of our other users and we can try to figure out
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.640]   who you know because now we have that piece of data
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.400]   that we did not know before.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.360]   So, it's a dangerous, dangerous thing.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.760]   It's almost in the public's best interest for Spotify
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.920]   to remain independent.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.760]   I mean, it's bad enough that WhatsApp is being acquired.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.400]   Because again, every scrap of data that is,
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.280]   it's not just a question of, you know, your traffic.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.440]   Again, it's just something as simple as your cell phone
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.640]   number, if they have that, suddenly they have another way
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.880]   to link you to other people.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.560]   There's a, that, the bot get off and I can't--
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.160]   - It's, it's, it's so-- - It's so, yeah.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.440]   I agree, Sunzu, you deny your enemy information
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:05.640]   just on principle.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.000]   - I tried for so long to not give Google or Facebook
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.320]   my phone number, but when I had to sign up
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.200]   for the Facebook developer thing to be able to clear cash
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.320]   on articles and I more had to give them a phone number
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.200]   or you just couldn't get into the developer portal.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.040]   And with Google, they were doing that Google,
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.640]   like you, they put your author pictures,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.920]   you had to sign up for Google+, and now if you do AMP,
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.000]   they'll put the little lightning bolt
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.240]   and they keep doing these things
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.960]   and WhatsApp is sharing my phone number now
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.360]   and it's increasingly difficult to keep that stuff away
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.960]   from massive social sifters.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:35.360]   - Remember the Pandora bought RDO's assets, Pandora and Amazon,
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.520]   both are expected to launch $10 a month
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.120]   streaming music services in the next few months,
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.640]   although Amazon might have a nice little slice
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.440]   by doing a $5 version for Amazon Echo only,
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.160]   which would be kind of interesting.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.240]   - Amazon Prime, you get it for five bucks.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.800]   Comes next day, next day delivery,
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.040]   you mean it's a five bucks? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.000]   - I'd hate to be Pandora in this position.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.360]   Pandora's been struggling all along,
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.040]   it's a very difficult business.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.280]   I think they decided that the radio business wasn't enough
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.240]   that doing streaming music like Spotify would be better,
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:14.000]   but I don't know if history's on their side on this one.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.520]   It does seem like it'll be Amazon, Apple,
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520]   and Google last men standing.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.960]   And I like, I think you're right,
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.960]   I like your idea of Facebook acquiring Spotify.
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.360]   - And Google took songs, they're all sort of
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.040]   one somewhere. - Right, I bet you're within the next,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.040]   if they can't make these record label deals,
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.840]   within the next few months, you'll hear Facebook acquires.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.320]   - Twitter, #hashtag music, that didn't go very far.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:43.480]   - Yeah, remember that, that was a brief experiment.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.120]   - It's also interesting, if Facebook were
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.560]   to acquire a music service company,
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.800]   now suddenly they have a much bigger weapon
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.480]   to wave against the labels than Apple might have
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.840]   against the labels.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.360]   Facebook can say, guess what,
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.960]   we're giving you a wonderful opportunity
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.080]   to promote your music through news feeds,
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.960]   and we're giving you a wonderful way to encourage,
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.400]   to encourage our users to promote your stuff
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.880]   through their friends.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.080]   - And not even hearing- - And be frustrated anymore.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.320]   - Exactly, and we feel as though this is such
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.000]   a wonderful asset that we're bringing to you
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.480]   that you'll be happy to give us a deal
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.120]   that's 15% better than whatever you're offering Apple
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.560]   at anytime.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.880]   Meanwhile, Microsoft has a good use for your MacBook Air.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:22.960]   - Watch. - This one's got the
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.880]   attachable keys, it comes with a pen-
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.560]   - You can write this for four.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.200]   - This Mac doesn't have any of that,
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.680]   it's less useful, like a hat for your cat.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.960]   Surface has touch and a beautiful screen.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.360]   You can see things like they've never been seen.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.160]   This Mac doesn't quite compare,
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.400]   it's slower, heavy, and a bit square, full than half.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.240]   - The Apple knows better music.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.360]   - I have to say,
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.680]   - It's made for me.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.040]   - Think you make a good point.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.760]   No offense to this gentleman,
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:53.080]   I'm just saying that that's a lot to listen to
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.200]   in these over 30 seconds.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.880]   - The MacBook Air. - Was that made
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.720]   on Songsmith?
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.160]   - Is it useful as a hat for your cat?
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.800]   - Let's see.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.440]   - What I should be talking about briefly,
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.320]   we'll talk about the problem that I fix it
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.520]   has pinpointed in their most recent article
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.200]   with the iPhone 6S,
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.880]   not S, the 6 and the 6 Plus, the Bendy one.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:20.920]   - The Touch Disease, is that where the one?
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.800]   - Yeah, the Touch Disease.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.760]   The idea is that because this phone is a little more bendy
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.360]   than its successor, the 6S,
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.800]   there's some torque placed on the logic board,
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.880]   which causes the micro beads
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.000]   that are connecting the chip,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.920]   the touch sensor chip to the motherboard to crack and break.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.240]   You may have seen this symptom
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.000]   after we mentioned it yesterday on iOS today,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.960]   I had a number of people tweet me pictures
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.080]   of the gray bar that appears at the top of the screen,
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.560]   and then the touch sensor becomes unresponsive.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.440]   I fix it interviewed micro soldering specialists,
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.880]   or for those of you in the UK,
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.640]   micro soldering specialists who said,
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.840]   "Oh, you do it that way in Canadian too?"
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.760]   - I do, but I get made fun of.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:08.200]   - Micro soldering specialists say,
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.880]   you could of course replace the logic board,
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.800]   which is what Apple will do if you bring it to Apple.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.240]   But an Apple, by the way, has seen this enough
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.800]   so that at least one correspondent said,
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.440]   "Yeah, when I brought it to Ab," the genius, he said,
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.920]   "Oh yeah, yeah, here's a new phone."
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.160]   Most of these phones are out of warranty
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.000]   'cause they're two years old,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.120]   unless you bought extended warranty.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.440]   - You're under Apple Care Plus, you're fine.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.680]   If you're under the original Apple Care,
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.600]   you're casting it. - Right.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.840]   - You can, Apple doesn't like this.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.000]   In fact, has even censored the suggestion
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.840]   of this on Apple's support forums.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.720]   You can bring it to a third party specialist,
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.600]   and if they are micro soldering experts,
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.480]   they can not reflow the solder,
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.280]   but actually re-solder that board and strengthen it
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.760]   in such a way that your touch screen works again.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.520]   You don't get the gray bar.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.600]   And that's a considerably less expensive repair
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.040]   than getting a new logic board.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.760]   Any thoughts?
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.400]   - These things happen.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.240]   I mean, anytime there's a new product,
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.400]   you can't foresee everything.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.360]   Apple typically measures like 20 times
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.560]   before they make a statement on these things,
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.480]   and it takes arduously long for them to react to it,
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.960]   and it frustrates everyone who suffers from it exponentially,
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.200]   but then we have seen graphics card recalls
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   and screen recalls and disc recalls.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.840]   - Even though, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.280]   - So, and out of warranty devices, right?
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.160]   They'll replace it if it's their fault.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.360]   - They worry to buy another iPhone.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.720]   - That's their biggest goal in life.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.480]   So, they tend to take care of people.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.760]   - Somebody's already started a course,
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.560]   a class action lawsuit on this.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.400]   - Yeah.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.240]   - It's just, you have to realize that
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.200]   how many of these have to be defective
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.960]   before it becomes a real hurricane,
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:35.760]   and it's not a hurricane.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.840]   So, this is not something that can happen on occasion,
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.840]   obviously enough for I fix it to actually do a look into it,
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.080]   and for people to actually have a solution to it.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.560]   It also means that it's in Apple's best interest
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.840]   to say that if someone brings an iPhone,
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.800]   we will not announce this as an official program,
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.960]   but we can put the word out to the Genius Bar
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.680]   is that, look, someone comes in with a phone
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.800]   with obviously this problem, just swap it up.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.960]   You don't even have to explain why you're doing it.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:06.400]   You can still have the Wear Awesome policy,
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.160]   and this is one of the reasons why I always say,
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.360]   if you can bring a malfunctioning device
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.040]   to an Apple store, do it,
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.000]   because the worst that'll happen is that they'll say
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.440]   that they can't do anything for you,
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.600]   and there's an excellent chance that even out of warranty,
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:22.920]   they will again pull the big Wear Awesome lever
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.880]   on the side of the building.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.920]   - Just don't be a jerk to them,
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.760]   'cause it's their discretion, so be nice.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.800]   - Yeah, I'm also broken, I'm so pleased.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.280]   - Please help me.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.040]   - The consistent stuff is not,
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.880]   don't like start yelling at end with it,
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.320]   and now I wanna know what you're gonna do about it,
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.680]   or come up with some absolute malarkey about,
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.360]   no, no, I absolutely did not,
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.800]   I was using it in the tub,
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.840]   but holding it way above the water,
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.200]   no, it did not get splashed,
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.520]   even though it smells like Mr. Bubble.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.360]   (laughing)
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.440]   - That's not water on the screen.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.920]   - So many store managers,
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.680]   when I looked into this a couple of years ago,
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.280]   told gave me pretty much the exact same statement,
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.760]   which is that, you know,
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.760]   if I will try to find a way that I can be awesome for you,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.800]   if you're honest with me,
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:12.000]   and I feel as though you did your best
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.600]   to take care of this device,
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.720]   if I can at all do anything to help you out,
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.600]   I will do it even if it's not within warranty or whatever.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.160]   So, absolutely correct.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.840]   - You know an interesting thought about the headphone jack,
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:25.360]   and this may be one of the rationales Apple
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.160]   will offer on Wednesday, a week from tomorrow.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.240]   The microphone, the sad state,
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.800]   this is a Bloomberg piece that came out a few days ago,
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   the sad state of mics is what's holding back Siri,
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.480]   and Alexa, the fact that the microphone in your phone,
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.920]   you know, how often does Siri misunderstand you?
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.800]   Well, maybe it's 'cause the microphones aren't very good.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.800]   - That's totally true.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.240]   I mean, Alexa has big, be-forming microphones in it,
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.040]   and it really shows the difference,
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.000]   and you do have multiple microphones,
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:57.760]   and they have called them,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.000]   be-informing microphones before,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.720]   but they're tiny little microphones,
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.560]   and they don't do what a standalone device that is primed.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.400]   And I talked about this before,
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.240]   but I went to Nuance,
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.200]   and they had these giant, be-informing microphones
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.960]   and video cameras, and you'd snap twice,
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.160]   and everything would lock on you,
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.720]   and it would understand every word,
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.520]   even if you were in a bar, it didn't matter.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.040]   It was just that spot on,
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.320]   and when you're dealing with anything much smaller,
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.680]   it gets exponentially more-
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.200]   - So that extra room and the savings and cost
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.960]   by eliminating the phone headphone jack
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:27.160]   would be a great place to put more microphones.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.760]   Maybe that's the argument, you know?
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.600]   - I'd love that. - I'd love that.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.760]   - You're gonna make Siri better
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.060]   by giving you some really good array mics.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.360]   - Eh.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.440]   - They'd have to do a really good job saying,
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.520]   "Here is how much space the micro-feed
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.120]   that Jack was taking up.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.120]   Here's how much board space we need for the new microphone."
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.960]   And it's, like I said-
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.360]   - Well, they can also let us do some of the,
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.680]   carry some of the water for 'em,
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.160]   because the tech press will understand
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.040]   and maybe explain as well, right?
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.600]   And I think that this,
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.680]   Apple's gonna have to get the tech press
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.360]   to explain why it's a good idea to remove it.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.400]   - Several years ago, my then four-year-old,
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.040]   Godson came to me and he said,
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.560]   "You know, my big brother, when he grows up,
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.720]   he's gonna do two things."
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:15.560]   And I said, "What?"
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.960]   And he said, "One, he's gonna conquer death."
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.360]   And I said, "Oh, wow, that's a pretty big job
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.200]   you're giving him."
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.120]   And he said, "And two, he's gonna make Siri work
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.640]   really, really well."
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.480]   - Yeah.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.880]   - Which is tougher, I don't know.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.360]   - Yeah.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.320]   - Four kids, he's got a lot of expectations.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.400]   - Yeah.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   - But I'm a little bothered by some of the stuff
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.760]   that I've been reading about.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   It's one thing to say that, look,
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.920]   eventually people are not gonna be,
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.960]   it's one thing to say that, in the end,
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.480]   leading the headphone jack is not a really harmful thing
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.320]   for Apple to do it,
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.200]   but inconvenient people temporarily.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.000]   But I think the vast majority of people
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.520]   aren't gonna be affected and it makes room for whatever.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.680]   I think that there are too many people that are saying,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.200]   God bless you, Apple, from finally freeing us
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.440]   from the tyranny of the head full.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.280]   - That's the one I understand, I agree with you.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.120]   - Head fulls are terrible.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:11.160]   - And boys, and it's only Apple would be so visionary,
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.800]   it's like, tone it down, you're not,
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.720]   that's being really indulgent.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.080]   And also, the phrase carrying water for Apple
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.400]   is something that I use a lot,
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.040]   and not in public because I don't know,
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.400]   I don't know what people are actually thinking
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.560]   when they're, it's not my place to judge
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.440]   how other people cover Apple,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.280]   but it's like sometimes I feel like,
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.280]   wow, you've really felt it was important
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.400]   to not simply say, hey, calm down,
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.400]   it's not the end of the world that this doesn't have a phone.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.240]   You really had to make sure that you had to say
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.760]   that other companies suck for having headphone jacks.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.840]   Really?
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.160]   - No, I don't. - It was that important.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.120]   - At best time. - Out 2000.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.680]   - You really think that Apple is reading everything
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.560]   you write and saying, maybe I won't send him,
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.720]   I won't invite this person to the next, to the exact link.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.080]   Oh, you know, Christina Warren,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.800]   I got Christina Warren got invited to the next--
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.080]   - She's like, his motto too.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.800]   - And now she's like, his motto so it's like, yes.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.840]   - Although, his motto's been invited back
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.160]   for the last couple of years.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.880]   - They've been great, those were Christina--
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.440]   - They got out of the penalty box.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.280]   - Right, exactly.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.760]   It's like, if you, if you deny Christina Warren access
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.680]   to an event, that's stupid.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.520]   - I don't think you can.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.640]   I think you would be there anyway.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.320]   I don't think it's possible.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:27.800]   - So, yeah, best, the best I can offer Apple
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.040]   on the headphone jack is polite skepticism.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.000]   And we'll see, we'll see, we'll see.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.080]   I wanna hear your name. - It could be a big troll
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.680]   and they'd show it with a perfect headphone jack
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.520]   and say, got ya.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.840]   - Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.680]   - We're not giving you a corner and headphone jack.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.120]   - Maybe you've seen this before.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.440]   - Oh no, you haven't.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.560]   - That would be funny.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.120]   - We're not giving, we're not building
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.240]   into every iPhone 7, a tube headphone amp.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.240]   - We were joking about the Galaxy Note 7
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.880]   having space for a full on core headphone jack,
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.120]   just to really shove it to Apple.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.080]   Look what we got, full stereo.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.120]   - They actually said that.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:00.960]   They did that.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.240]   They said, yeah, it wouldn't be fun to--
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.600]   - But they stuck with 3.5.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.640]   They stuck with a little one.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.000]   I think that's sufficient.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.560]   Even my very fancy
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.880]   planar, electro planar headphones
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.080]   came with a plug, a mini jack plug.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.120]   It's so ubiquitous now that that's,
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.480]   you know, and I could use it adapter obviously.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.360]   - I had a couple of palms with 2.5s
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.680]   and I had a couple of HTCs with dongles.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.920]   They had just the USB and a dongle.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.760]   So it's nothing new.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.600]   I mean, companies and experimenters up here.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.680]   - The first Google phone did not have that much.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.120]   - But remember, we didn't listen to the music on it.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.840]   - To be fair, that was way before people were using phones
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.280]   as a ubiquitous MP3 music device.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.200]   It was like, for those freaks of you
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.280]   who are way ahead of the curve,
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.920]   we can actually, we'll actually give you an accessory
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.800]   and you're grateful to have that accessory.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   (laughing)
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.280]   - It's a breakout box.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.320]   Let's take a break, your picks of the week coming up
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.440]   in just a second.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.440]   We are here in our new East Side Studio.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.120]   The East Side Studio, we call it Tess is live.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.480]   And we're celebrating with a new T-shirt.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.720]   We got a great design.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.040]   Anthony Nielsen did a really nice design for the logo,
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.480]   the Tuit East Side Studio logo.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.600]   So we're gonna offer you a T-shirt,
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600]   as we do always at Teespring.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.040]   We're going a little farther though.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.320]   There's men's and women's T's.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.080]   And by the way, you can choose a variety of manufacturers.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.560]   And they also, we're also gonna offer a hoodie,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.960]   which is really nice.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.640]   We haven't done a hoodie in a while.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.040]   The Tuit logo on the front
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.160]   and the East Side Studio logo on the back.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.280]   These are not zip up hoodies.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.600]   These are the pullover hoodies.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.200]   And for the first time in a long time, a mug.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.200]   And I like this two tone.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.600]   It's a black mug with a white handle.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.160]   And it has the East Side Studio and the Tuit logo on it.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.960]   Teespring is where you can get this,
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.880]   but you can only get it through September 26th.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:52.800]   We've had good results doing these as limited time offers.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.520]   I kind of like the idea instead of having a store
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:55.760]   that just balloons up.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:00.760]   So for 30 days at tdespring.com/tuit.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.120]   And we're charging pretty much the lowest price you can.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.640]   I think the T-shirts are 20 bucks.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.440]   The VNEX 20 bucks and the hoodies, $32.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.400]   The mug is $14.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   We make a little bit on it,
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.240]   but really we want you to have this memorabilia
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:21.000]   for your life.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.360]   And so please tspring.com/tuit.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.800]   We're gonna take a little break
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.560]   and come back here, picks of the week gentlemen.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.240]   But first I wanna talk to you about the tracker.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.920]   I love these little devices,
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.360]   but maybe that's 'cause I'm so prone to losing my keys.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:37.680]   I finally started chaining my keys to my man bag.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:39.200]   And now with one tracker,
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.360]   I get kind of does double duty.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.520]   It keeps me from losing my keys and my bag, which is awesome.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:47.160]   These are little quarter size,
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.600]   anodized aluminum devices you can attach to almost anything.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.200]   In fact, including your pet because it's small enough.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.840]   It's not any bigger than a dog tag.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.720]   It's actually lighter than most dog tags.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.800]   They even have a waterproof enclosure you can put on it
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.640]   if your cat is prone to getting wet.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.560]   And this way, no matter where your animal is,
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.520]   you can see where they are.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.840]   The tracker pairs via Bluetooth LE.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.920]   Now that's important, I'll tell you why that is in a second.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.960]   To your smartphone, Android or iOS.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.800]   And the battery, because of Bluetooth LE
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.040]   lasts up to a year and is replaceable.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.960]   So don't think this is a disposable device.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.280]   And by no means is it.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.640]   It's a two way device too.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.360]   See the button at the bottom of the tracker?
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.040]   You press that and your phone will start beeping at you,
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.600]   even if it's silenced.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.880]   And of course, if you leave your keys behind,
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.160]   you could check the tracker app on your phone and it'll say,
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.320]   here's where your keys are.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.800]   Here's the last place we saw them.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.360]   Even if you're outside a Bluetooth range,
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.440]   because Tracker has the world's largest crowd GPS network
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.640]   in the world.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.760]   They've sold a million and a half tracker devices.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:52.800]   At every one of those tracker users,
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.360]   when they get within reach, within Bluetooth range
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.560]   of your device, within 100 feet, they'll notice it.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.320]   The software will then send you a note.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.520]   Your software will say, your tracker was just seen
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.640]   on the tables in Las Vegas.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.320]   Oh, and you'll know.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.720]   So this is a really great solution.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.200]   They also have the new tracker Atlas
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.520]   that works with your tracker Bravo
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.040]   or third party Bluetooth trackers to pinpoint your items
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.520]   on a customized old floor plan of your house.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.760]   That's neat too.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:26.000]   So you don't just know what's in your house.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]   Yeah, I left my keys at home.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.760]   You know, it's in the cushion of the sofa in the living room.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:35.560]   Go to the tracker.com and never lose your possessions again.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.520]   And just for you, if you enter the promo code MACBRAKE,
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.040]   you'll get 30% off your entire order.

[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.160]   And oh, I should point these out.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:48.720]   These are beautiful.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:51.200]   People have been asking me, hey, I like that MACBRAKE weekly
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.560]   tracker you got.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.600]   You can have them print anything you want on the tracker.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.520]   This is using some UV ink technology that is really robust.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.720]   You can have your dog's name.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.120]   You can engrave them because they're aluminum.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.360]   Or you can have an image on there as well.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.440]   A laser engraved image or a custom printed image.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.400]   And that's also 30% off when you use our offer code MACBRAKE
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.080]   at the tracker.com.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:22.800]   Andy, you're not co your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.360]   My pick is something I really, really enjoyed.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.680]   If you've got an Apple TV and your court cutting
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.160]   and you're trying to watch, let's say, the Olympics and NBC
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.720]   made it very hard for you to watch the Olympics,
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.680]   you might have wished that you had some sort of way
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.920]   to just get live TV on your Apple TV.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.360]   And I got this really, really cool boxing
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.320]   use Creme Cam 3000, the future of video podcasting here.
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.080]   If I can just make a quick adjustment.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.520]   So you can see my iPad here.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.600]   This is a device called HD Home Run.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.920]   Damn it, sorry.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:00.800]   I accidentally dislodged Creme Cam 3000,
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.960]   the future of video podcasting.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.160]   So I'm going to try hard to just hold this.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.200]   What HD Home Run is, it's a tiny, tiny little box
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.600]   that will connect to, depending on the model you get,
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:13.800]   either your cable TV or a terrestrial antenna.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.960]   If you've got it attached to an antenna,
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.440]   you can put it anywhere in the house.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.840]   So you can basically put it in the upstairs guest bedroom
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.640]   window, the one that has the best,
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:27.280]   gets the best coverage of broadcast television.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.160]   And then it will just simply,
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.360]   it will be like a networked TV tuner
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.880]   that any app in your home network can access.
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.280]   So for instance, if you are, if you got an Apple TV,
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.360]   you will be able to tune into everything
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.760]   that you can receive via that cable device
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.800]   or on our broadcast, you can change channels.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.880]   You can do, there are iOS apps that will access it,
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.680]   there are Android apps that will access it.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:59.080]   It'll even be, it's because it conforms to a recognized standard.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:02.040]   You can even, my NAS, my network,
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.320]   my Synology network attached storage,
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:07.560]   its video player app will recognize it
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:10.920]   and I can stream that basically throughout the NAS.
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:14.960]   It will also act as a PVR attached to that NAS.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.320]   So I can just set recurring things.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:23.800]   And so every show is gonna be captured in full HD
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.240]   that I can then watch wherever I want, whenever I want.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.440]   And this thing costs only about $80 or $90.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.800]   Really, really great solution.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.920]   Again, just the idea that the last time
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.520]   that I really looked at TV tuners,
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:39.880]   and let me just see if I can get this, go in here,
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:42.160]   see something that's not something,
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.920]   that's not Judge Judy, okay Arthur, there you go.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:52.760]   And my T, my, there you go, my Wi-Fi really sucks here.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:56.040]   This is just over Wi-Fi.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:59.360]   But over the year to your Wi-Fi device.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:03.760]   Exactly, well, it's the actual device itself requires,
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.600]   I'm sorry, this is--
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.400]   Crankam, go home, you're drunk.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.840]   No, no, I'm just gonna see again.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.760]   Unfortunately, I pulled it out of, out of its patented--
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.600]   patented--
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.840]   It's my rich.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.680]   And I'm trying to, there we go.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.400]   So scared.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.760]   And the Wi-Fi in the office is terrible.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.280]   So please excuse it, there's like--
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.120]   Oh, that looks great.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:22.960]   Drop frame.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.240]   But like on my Apple TV, it is just as good as you would get
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.920]   from actually better than cable TV,
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:31.520]   'cause there seems to be, in my PBS station,
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.440]   does less compression on it.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.200]   And like I said, it's just the ability
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.080]   to suddenly be able to watch regular TV
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:40.720]   wherever you want.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.080]   And when you have devices that can actually record
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.480]   to simply record TV whenever you want,
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.520]   which means that when the Med Opera
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.120]   does their PBS simulcast of Met and HD,
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.360]   I can't, I don't just have to just watch it.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:58.440]   I can also record it, save it, add it to my NAS,
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:01.320]   and now it's part of my network storage.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:03.600]   And it's just, again, for, it's,
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.480]   when the last time I looked at this sort of stuff,
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.080]   I'm gonna put Cream Camp 3000,
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:10.320]   Future View podcasting back into its host mode.
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.240]   The last time that I looked at this stuff,
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.120]   I was used to the idea,
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:18.040]   I bet it's gonna be like a USB dongle
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:19.440]   that I have to plug into some place,
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.200]   and it'll only be available on this one device.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.720]   And the idea that the idea of having, again,
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.520]   a TV server that now every, like multiple devices,
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.200]   my Android TV and the living room can use it,
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.880]   my Roku can use it, my iOS devices can use it,
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.800]   my Mac can use it, it's just so good,
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.680]   works so well, and I highly recommend it.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.320]   It really does, it's not as though you absolutely need
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.680]   to have broadcast TV on your Apple TV,
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.720]   but I think that you will agree that there is that 5%
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.760]   of programming that you're kind of missing out on,
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.600]   and that's the only thing that you miss
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.640]   when you cancel your cable,
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.160]   and usually it's like things like live sports
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.840]   and stuff like that, and this will just really nicely
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.160]   just fill in that gap.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.800]   - It's, whatever happened to Elgato?
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:15.800]   - They sold the ITV to a company that's based in Europe,
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:21.080]   they canceled the, basically, so now they're focusing
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.720]   just on European products.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.640]   You can still go to the site and buy the ITV software
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.640]   for like 90 euros, and I still have a couple of ITVs
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.600]   from a couple of years ago.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.120]   When I first started on this Quest of,
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.280]   I want to be able to record television and archive it again.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.200]   Quest, I thought, I'm really gonna buy this for $90.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:46.640]   I better exhaustively look at everything else that's available
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.880]   before I spend $90 on a software download,
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.240]   and yeah, this is, HD Home Run has just outpaced it,
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:57.840]   and between the HD Home Run and even this, that $35,
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.160]   Chinese-made TV tuner with the USB hard drive you can plug in,
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.160]   it just kicks the butt of pretty much any other solution
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:05.520]   you can find.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:08.400]   - Well, I am glad, I've been talking about this
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.280]   on the radio show for some time, people love it,
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.720]   I've never got one, but this is a really good solution,
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.200]   I know, a lot of people use it.
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.040]   But you need an over-the-air signal,
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.160]   and if you're in an area where you can get one,
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.640]   this is a great solution.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:24.160]   - Yeah, they also, they make one that's this,
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.120]   I have the over-the-air HD Home Run,
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.360]   they also make a version that will tune in
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.440]   Clearquam Digital Cable and also accepts a cable card,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.320]   so if you want, you can actually just-
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.160]   - So it's like it's basically-
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.600]   - Exactly, so for free, it will record everything
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.400]   that is unscrambled on your cable system,
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.560]   and if you want it for two,
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:47.720]   be able to tune in, pay channels as well,
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.280]   you just lease a cable card from your cable company,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.480]   it's sticking in there, and you'll be able to tune in
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:54.560]   everything there.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.560]   I mean, it seems as though the entire IPTV industry
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.360]   has thanked the heavens for HD Home Run,
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.760]   because it's like the standard,
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.880]   every single piece of software I've ever seen
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:11.280]   for every platform, it will definitely support HD Home Run,
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.600]   and they'll recommend HD Home Run for their hardware,
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.200]   or for their hardware, and there are a couple of other
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.720]   kind of devices out there that they'll say they're thinking
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:23.000]   about supporting, but they're saying, why would you bother?
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.680]   We're not really excited about this other competing product
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.360]   because all we have to do is tell you to buy HD Home Run
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:29.560]   and you're good.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:31.520]   - Somebody in the chatroom,
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.200]   Compe386 says HD Home Run puts a signal on your network
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.320]   that schedulers can use, so he's able to use it
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:42.320]   with his ITV software to record with a point-and-click GUI,
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.960]   so that's cool too, that's another reason for one.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.640]   - It's compatible with a whole bunch of stuff,
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.200]   so they're also coming out, the company is also coming up
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:52.040]   with their own DVR app that's been in the works for two years,
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.400]   I think they even had a Kickstarter about it,
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.640]   and they haven't really released it yet,
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:59.200]   but again, it's supported by a number of different apps,
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:00.960]   as a matter of fact, the app that I showed you
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:03.840]   is called Insta TV, and there is no,
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.920]   I don't believe there's a native iOS app for it
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:09.080]   that's actually given away by the company,
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:11.280]   but this is one of two or three different third party apps
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:15.400]   for iOS that also, you buy it once for your iOS devices,
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.360]   it also works on Apple TV, and it's worked perfectly well
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.560]   for my needs for this.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.880]   - Very good.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.920]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Renee Ritchie
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.160]   with his pick of the week.
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:28.320]   All right, so it's tough in the best of times
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:29.840]   to follow an Andy Nott co-pick,
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:30.920]   so I'm just gonna let you know
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:33.440]   that this is not gonna be as great going straight in,
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.920]   but last week I was talking about
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.480]   that giant movie battery I bought
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.880]   because I was out using my phone, especially roaming,
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.360]   also maybe hunting Pokemon, whatever,
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.280]   let's not get into it, maybe some Snapchat,
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.400]   but it's just the amount of power consumption, again,
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.440]   it keeps going up and up,
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:47.720]   and the size of batteries and battery chemistry
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.920]   is not changing much.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.360]   So I had to do a bunch of road trips,
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.520]   some of them were just to Ottawa,
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.920]   some of them were a little bit further,
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:55.280]   and I say an hour and a half, you know, to five hours.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:58.240]   And one of the problems, if we wanna call it a problem,
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.800]   is that everybody in my family, my friends
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.200]   and their families all have iOS devices,
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.160]   now mostly iPhones, and all of them on long trips
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:07.960]   have the same problem, is that they are either
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.920]   hunting their Pokemon or checking the web
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.120]   or doing something, because we can no longer be bored
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.960]   in a car, we can no longer talk to each other in cars.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.560]   It's always listening to some things,
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:20.560]   dreaming something, headphones on, playing something,
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.720]   and the batteries wear down.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.560]   So I had a single port car adapter,
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:27.280]   my car is not modern enough to have USB ports,
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.800]   and it was not enough.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.800]   So I rushed to an Apple store,
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:34.480]   and I picked up this Falcon 2 port car adapter,
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:37.520]   and I have a charging port in both the front
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:40.720]   and the back of my car, so I was able to plug this in
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:43.320]   and feed four iPhones, or I think it was three iPhones
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.680]   and one iPad, for the entire trip,
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.560]   and I went from being, you know,
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.240]   just the driver to being a hero.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.920]   And it's been so useful around town.
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.560]   I've picked up people from the airports recently,
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:59.480]   'cause we had some people in for meetings and things,
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:00.640]   and as soon as you pick 'em up, you say,
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:01.480]   "Would you like to charge?"
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:02.600]   And they're like, "Really?"
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.280]   Because I was sucking an airport all day,
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:06.120]   I'd love to charge, don't you need it?
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.080]   And because we're Canadian, we would spend five minutes
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.840]   arguing about who got the charging port,
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.200]   but now there's enough for everybody,
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.640]   and you just, you plug it right in,
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:16.000]   and you just go driving around town.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.600]   Basically, anytime, any place now,
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:20.040]   I have high capacity iPhone charging
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.280]   for every seat in the car,
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.520]   and it's completely absurd,
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.360]   but it turned into something that was just,
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:29.960]   it went from a glorious dream to a must-have very quickly.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.360]   There's several vendors that have these.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.720]   Belkin was the one in the Apple store
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.040]   when I really needed it, so I picked up their version.
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.920]   But if you are doing a lot of road trips,
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.680]   if you are going away for Labor Day,
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.560]   if you've taken the kids to school,
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.840]   anything like that,
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.160]   one of these will come in super handy.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.000]   - My pick is really inappropriate,
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.200]   but I'm gonna do it anyway.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.240]   (laughs)
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:51.080]   - Said a Galaxy Note?
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:53.600]   - I'm gonna make you feel better about your pick.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.080]   Although, you should feel pretty good,
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.200]   'cause you got that for 40 bucks,
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.120]   I actually had to buy $100,000 Tesla
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:00.800]   to get four USB ports in my car.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.080]   So, that is a big improvement,
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:04.240]   what you've done there.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.320]   We're going on a vacation in a couple of weeks.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:07.920]   I won't be here, by the way,
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.000]   for a couple of Mac break weekly shows.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.040]   I'm sorry, I'll miss you all,
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.600]   going on a Baltic cruise.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:17.800]   But you know, I have to get ready for these trips.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:20.080]   And among the things that I always bring
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.800]   is a deck of cards or two,
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.440]   'cause I love playing cribbage, I love playing,
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.680]   and I have a lovely cribbage board.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.360]   That should be my pick next week.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.840]   I love playing gin rummy with my lovely wife.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:33.440]   I think cards are a good thing for vacation.
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:35.080]   Now, of course, you could just bring your plain old
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.400]   boring bicycle cards with you.
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.880]   But I fell for this, this was from Boing Boing, by the way.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.280]   They recommended a company called
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.600]   the Miscellaneous Goods Company.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.480]   This is the Ultimate Hipster Company.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.360]   And these are ridiculously expensive, a four pack.
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.440]   The cards are $15 a deck, or four for $42.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.680]   Normally I get my playing cards from casinos.
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.040]   It's a buck 50 a deck used once.
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:00.560]   But these are so pretty, so much prettier
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:04.040]   than the bicycle cards I've been using
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.800]   that I just, I couldn't resist.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:08.640]   And I have to say they're totally gorgeous.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:11.240]   Let me show you the cards.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.880]   Hand printed in the United States,
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.080]   they're very old fashioned, aren't they?
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.280]   They have, for some reason, they have pips.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.240]   I guess that's another old fashioned thing to do
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.360]   on the corners of the cards,
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.200]   as well as, of course, the suit and the number.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.840]   Maybe that's easier for people to catch, to count pips.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.600]   I love the black and white look of the ace
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.560]   and the face cards.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.320]   They're just really pretty.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:38.840]   These are printed in the US, as I mentioned.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.800]   Get the four pack, 'cause that's a better deal.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.640]   And I did that.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:43.960]   They come in white, or actually this is more like
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:46.760]   an ivory, blue, red and black.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.200]   So you can have cards for every occasion.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.500]   This is what I call vacation.
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.880]   Missily, you're a Tesla company.
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:56.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:57.560]   I really like their stuff.
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.840]   They have a lot of overpriced hipster paraphernalia.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.080]   So if you've been looking for the overpriced hipster paraphernalia,
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.760]   that's the place to go.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.360]   Hey, we're out of time.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.960]   Time to say goodbye, because next week,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:15.200]   we will know so much more, and we can--
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.200]   It won't change.
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:18.640]   Finally, the world will change.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.440]   Sometimes, I know when they first came out with the iPad
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.200]   and the first came out with the iPhone, I thought,
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.760]   I remember thinking on the eve of the announcement,
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.880]   this is the last day of my life
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:31.480]   that I won't have an iPhone or an iPad.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:34.040]   So the last Mac break, we'll worry about the headphone jack.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:35.680]   We'll know for sure next week.
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:37.720]   This may be the last week of my life
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:40.680]   where I won't-- well, I have a headphone jack, you see.
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.040]   Look, how much your house and taking away all your own
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.160]   headphone jack, is that the worst?
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:48.160]   We will be here not next Tuesday, but next Wednesday.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.240]   So the way this is going to work,
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.880]   we're going to be broadcasting a week from tomorrow
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:56.080]   at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1,700 UTC.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.800]   It'll be Megan Moroni from TNT and iOS today.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.360]   Andy Inaco from Mac Break Weekly in the Chicago
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.880]   sometimes and myself will be sitting and watching
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.960]   Tim and Phil and the gang present
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:12.040]   and talking about that behind the scenes, starting at 10 a.m.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.120]   Actually, a little bit, 9.45 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.920]   And then right after Mac Break Weekly.
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.360]   And Renee's going to be in the room.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.000]   Actually, most of our usual Mac Break Weekly contributors
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.640]   will be at the event.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.720]   I'm hoping we can get you Renee after the event.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.600]   We'll set a crew down there and try to grab you
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:29.560]   and get your opinions because I presume by then
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.160]   you'll have had some hands on with whatever Apple announces
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:32.800]   next week.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:35.120]   Have a great trip to the Bay Area.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:36.880]   You were smart to book that flight.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.880]   Turned out.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:38.720]   You knew.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:40.120]   You knew what you were doing.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:41.640]   Lucky I got lucky.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.000]   I'm Warren.com.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]   That's where you'll find Renee Richie at Renee Richie
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.040]   on Twitter.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.000]   And don't forget his fabulous podcasts,
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.600]   including the newest Apple Talk, which is just dynamite.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.400]   Thank you Renee.
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.080]   Andy Anako, you'll find him at the Chicago Sun Times, C-W-O-B.
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:59.880]   And Nako's Almanac and the 5x5 network.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.000]   And Material on the replay network, which is all about Google.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.920]   Shh, don't tell anybody.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.680]   Don't tell anybody.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.400]   I'm a polymath.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.800]   He's a polymath.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.480]   He's an auto-dodact.
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.160]   And that's not a kind of Pokemon.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.240]   For God's sakes.
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.400]   There's a poly world, but not a polymath.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.760]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.080]   And we'll see you next time now.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.080]   It's time to get back to work, because the break time is over.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.080]   It's time to get back to work, because the break time is over.
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:30.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:33.020]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:35.600]   (upbeat music)
