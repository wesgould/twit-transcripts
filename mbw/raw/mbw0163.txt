[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all the Mac stuff,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.680]   all that stuff from Apple on the line with me right now
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.400]   from his lair in Dorchester.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.120]   Is it in Dorchester?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.080]   No, no, no.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.600]   It's in the outer greater metro, outer affordable Boston
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   ring suburb area.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.520]   The greater Boston metro area.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.800]   Mr. Andy and I go from the celestial waist of bandwidth
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.280]   and the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.320]   You figure out which is which.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.200]   Once again, I'm very, very, very proud to be occupying a full 25%
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240]   of the screen's solar system.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.840]   You are.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.360]   Look, you're in the upper right hand corner.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.760]   That's it.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.880]   The rest of it empty.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.680]   Empty empty empty.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.600]   But you're well framed.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.160]   He's beautiful.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.800]   He's the wedding for Charlie Weaver, Joanne Worley,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.920]   and Charles Nelson Riley.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   I'll take it and not go to block.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.560]   Also here, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.320]   Hello.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   And we are happy today that we have two things Apple did
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.600]   before the show.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.280]   Unbelievantly are talking to them as a sunk in.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   Unbelievable.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.440]   No, no, no.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.640]   See, if they're making these announcements before the show,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.520]   you have to wonder what incredible things are
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   going to be talking about after we finish.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.480]   They've got Steve Jobs in a limo standing by and four new tablets
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.000]   and a new digital bicycle.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.920]   I heard that the iCar is on the way.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.560]   Pretty funny.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.000]   So I have been busy in Warrior Pose all morning.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520]   So what happened?
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.440]   We got new iMacs.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.240]   There's new-- 27-inch iMacs?
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.040]   Is that what you said?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.360]   27 inches.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.600]   Wow.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.200]   At this point, why don't you just go to 30?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.960]   Just make it 30.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.720]   Just in fact, 42 inches.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   Maybe because there's a structural reason.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920]   Maybe the thing would collapse inward on itself
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   if we're that big.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.280]   But I--
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   I can't even imagine.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   This is a 20 I use.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.800]   And this seems--
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   Or is this a 24?
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.880]   This is 24.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.760]   So that's pretty hefty.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   Just a little bit bigger than the 24.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.000]   Wow.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   And I'm not sure--
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.440]   one thing I wasn't able to figure out
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.240]   is what the resolution is going to put across that 27-inch.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.920]   Screen is.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.400]   One of the things--
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.200]   They haven't said that yet.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.080]   Is it in the store?
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.720]   Can I go to the store?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.440]   It's just 1920 by 1080.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Oh.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.240]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.600]   No, it isn't.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.680]   It is capable of 25, 60, 40.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520]   1440.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.440]   And why that's interesting for us
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280]   is that we actually do a lot of our smaller production
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.320]   now on iMacs.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.960]   So we have about 7 or 8 towers.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.320]   But we also have 5 or 6 iMacs that we're doing production on.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.240]   And one of the big problems is that in 1920 by 1080,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   when we put up an HD frame that we're working on,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.440]   it fills the whole screen.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.240]   And having just a little extra for real estate
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.160]   is a big deal.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.360]   It's an i5, which is a very impressive chip.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.720]   This is the Nahalum platform for $200 more i7,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.240]   which is an even more impressive chip.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.480]   You know, I don't know--
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   I remember looking at the--
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.640]   I'll have to see what the-- on our hardware show,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.040]   Ryan Shraton, we'll talk on Thursday with him about this.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.560]   My sense was the i5 gives you pretty good bang for the buck.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.200]   For most people, you don't need the i7.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   But you might-- if you're doing this with production,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.880]   you might want to go.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.080]   No, I--
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.000]   And it's only $200 more.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.720]   I'm used to Apple charging so much more.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.280]   For us, when we buy Mac Pros, we tend
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   to buy the middle road Mac Pro.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.960]   Not the fastest one, not the slowest one.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   We just buy the middle one.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.120]   And then we put a bunch of stuff in it.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.320]   For the iMacs, we pretty much just
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   buy the biggest Burley iMac that we can get.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.040]   And it's amazing how much work you can actually get done.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.360]   Options for RAM are four gigs, stock.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.640]   If you want to go to eight gigs, a mere $200 more.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.800]   Again, Apple's really-- this is unusual for Apple.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.280]   Usually they charge a lot of money.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160]   Now that's eight gigs four by two.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.280]   If you want to go two by four, it's more.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.840]   So if you want to keep some slots open for more RAM.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320]   So apparently it's got four slots.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   I do find that the number is interesting.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.240]   It's 27 inches and 21.5.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.760]   21.5.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.800]   Yeah, that's a smaller one.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.960]   So there's a smaller one for $11.99.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.280]   That is 21.5.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   It's just that we don't see it.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   We usually see 20, 22, 24.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.320]   I'm very curious as to--
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.000]   This is pretty nice.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.240]   One and two terabyte hard drives.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'm looking at the top of the line one.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.760]   Very impressive package for--
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.480]   starting at $19.99.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.880]   Yeah, I'm actually in credible values.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.840]   And that's their consumer computer.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.920]   Now it's 1080p.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.240]   Does that mean, Andy, that you could put Blu-ray on this sucker?
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.880]   It looks like that they're getting ready for that kind of move.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.720]   Maybe they're just simply acknowledging that most
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960]   of the content that they're hoping to sell people off the iTunes
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.760]   store is going to be in HD TV format.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.840]   I mean, what do you--
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.880]   You think 1080p, really?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.120]   I think so.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.160]   I think it's coming.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.240]   It seems like a simple thing to do.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.880]   The second thing is that it's probably
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440]   a source of cheaper displays.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320]   If they don't have to have custom displays,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.000]   custom digital displays made for PCUs,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.360]   they can simply say, look, this factory that's churning out
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.000]   displays that are already intended for Samsung and Panasonic
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   and Pioneer for home theater use, they can just simply say,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.480]   why don't you just run off a few $100,000 just for us?
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.280]   I remember when my nice living room TV was 27 inches.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   I know.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.800]   27 was a big TV, remember?
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   That was a big TV.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   We split it on the other side of the room.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.360]   You'd be sitting there all the way across this.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.400]   So ICE 5 is 4 cores, I7 is 4 cores, hyper threaded,
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800]   so you get 8 threads.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.480]   It's a lot on a little--
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.840]   It's a lot of threads for--
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.720]   It's a lot for $2,000.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.680]   And what's your sense of the iMac screens?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   Are they pretty good screens?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   I think they're great screens.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.880]   Because sometimes I know lower-ends--
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.560]   I mean, are these good as the cinema displays
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   in terms of quality of a color gamut?
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   This one's LED back.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.920]   We have in a different environment,
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.400]   but I'd say that they're pretty darn close.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.240]   LED backlight is going to make a difference.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.360]   I think that looks really good.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.920]   Display port.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.600]   So you could put--
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.040]   Is Display port one way, or can you put a device into the Mac
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.160]   and use the iMac?
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.400]   Yeah, you can, because if you have a laptop, I wonder.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.280]   I don't think you can put it into the Mac.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.120]   I think it's one way.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.640]   But I think what's great about that means--
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.480]   No, they're saying in the chairman, it accepts input.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.880]   Wow.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   There's a dirty joke in there, but I'm just
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.000]   going to leave it alone.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   It accepts input.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   Oh, it does.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.280]   27-inch models also support input
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.160]   from external Display port sources, adapter sold separately.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.120]   So what would that--
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   What's the scenario there if you--
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.320]   You could use it as your monitor for your laptop.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.480]   If you bring the laptop, use it a monitor.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.800]   You could put a Blu-ray player on it
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.200]   if it had the right adapter and watch Blu-ray movies on it.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.400]   Right.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   Really, that's a home TV.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.200]   That's like the Mac mini without the packaged into a screen.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.480]   That's pretty slick.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.200]   Did they mention what's on the back of it
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.040]   in terms of wall mounting abilities?
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.960]   Oh, like a Visa mat?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.120]   Well, the other ones don't have the Visa.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.640]   He's looking.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.560]   The reason he sounds like he's drifted off is--
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.120]   I looked at the one that's--
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.880]   He's peeking.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.040]   But I think I thought that I've seen ones where you can pull
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   that out, but I'm not sure.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.720]   The 27 is Visa-mountable.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.480]   Is it really?
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.440]   This is starting to get interesting.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.000]   Remember the Jason Calicanis rumor
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.800]   that Apple was going to make a TV?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.120]   In fact, I think he even said a 27-inch TV.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   This is it.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.880]   You take the pad off.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.360]   Visa compliant mounting position.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.560]   You put-- oh, wow.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.320]   Using optional--
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.120]   So you might want to replace your TV set.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.760]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.280]   That's dangerous.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.120]   If you're selling this as a computer that's wall mountable,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.000]   you're going to do a lot of really cool video.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.840]   That's one thing.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.960]   If you're selling it as a TV set, you're
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   going to be a wall mount saying, yeah,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.200]   but I could walk out of here with that no name.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   But last week, you can have--
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.560]   It's only people like us.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   But the thing is, it's not for somebody
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.720]   who's going to Walmart and saying, hey, that Visio at $400
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.600]   looks pretty good.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.680]   We're not talking about that.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   This is an incredible solution when you consider--
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.520]   I have a wall mounted monitor that I have on my--
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   that I work out to everything else.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.120]   But I watch it in my house, and I have a Mac Mini that
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.400]   drives it all.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.000]   And for the people who have been using their Mac Minis,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   or really their Apple TVs, but really the Mac Mini,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.520]   this just takes one piece out of that puzzle and just says,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.720]   well, you can just throw this one on the wall.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.760]   I think for $19.99, this is a pretty compelling product.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.120]   That's the top of the line.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.000]   As a computer, it's a very compelling product.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.680]   It's a beauty.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.600]   No, I agree.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.640]   But I think that's just making the mount compatible
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.480]   with every other mounting system is just one of those cheap
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.960]   decisions that pays off really, really big, where
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.000]   if they just add a few extra bucks worth of engineering,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.680]   they suddenly give people as many options as possible
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   for putting this on the wall of an editing suite,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.440]   or the wall of a dorm room, or whatever.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.640]   So it's kind of interesting.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.440]   The 27 is the one that has the Visa mount.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.400]   The 21 does not.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.600]   No.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.440]   It also has a Radeon 4850 HD.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   Beefy.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   The 512 megabyte.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.600]   That's pretty good for a all-in-one system.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.200]   I'm impressed.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.680]   I think this is a pretty compelling product from Apple.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.600]   Ships in November, not available today.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   But there's a 21 inch--
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   actually, I'm sorry.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.240]   The Nahelum versions are not available today.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.440]   The Core 2 27 inch is available today.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.040]   And I think it's in every respect the same.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   It's $300 less.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   But I would hold that for the Nahelum.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.560]   You're future proofing it.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.720]   Let's take a look at the Mac Mini.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.040]   Here's an interesting deal with Mini.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.720]   They've got a server Mini.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.960]   Mac Mini with Snow Leopard Server on it.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.280]   Now, I think that that's probably a good move also.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.560]   I think there are probably a lot of people--
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.080]   that's $1,000-- who might look at this 2.53 gigahertz Core
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.840]   2, 4 gigs of memory.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.440]   That's how we use them in the office.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.360]   So I use them in the home of the media server at home.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.040]   The office we use them as regular servers.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.000]   Dual 500 gig hard drives.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.920]   How do they do dual hard drives in there?
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.080]   Top drives.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.680]   Dual in one that little and then 9,400 M graphics,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.160]   which is, I think, a very competent graphics card.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.120]   And server.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.960]   Of course, if you use them as a--
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.160]   Snow Leopard's fine.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.960]   The ones we have in the office, we put--
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.480]   Oh, I see.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.240]   There's no obstacle to run.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.120]   We put a window on them and run that one.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.440]   That one doesn't have a slot.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.680]   What we really need is virtualization on the Mac.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.600]   I mean, Apple-- if Apple's not going to let someone else do it,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.120]   we need to--
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.240]   This is where Microsoft is really step to head.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.680]   We have windows on the Mac Mini's at the office
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.400]   because we want to run three to six servers, little key servers.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.040]   They're not doing a lot, but we want to run them all in one
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   computer.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.280]   And that's something we can't do on the Mac side.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.440]   As they point out in the chat room,
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.840]   if you don't already have a monitor,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.640]   you'd still be better off buying the Mac Mini--
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.800]   regular Mac Mini with a slot and 2.53 gigahertz
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.720]   core 2 and 320 gigahertz is 800 bucks.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.600]   If you don't have the monitor, you get a faster machine.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   But then you have all those--
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.200]   With a 21-inch monitor for $11.99.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.640]   No, don't get the Mini.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.560]   Get the iMac as well.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.440]   Get the iMac.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.720]   The Mini is not such a good deal if you don't already
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.560]   have a monitor.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.360]   Are there new-- oh, yes.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.960]   New MacBook, new plastic MacBook.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.880]   Firewire is gone again.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.960]   I think we're just waiting for that new light peak,
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.520]   whatever it's called.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.200]   I think that's really the future.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.920]   So the new 2.26 gigahertz core 2, 2 gigs of RAM,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.520]   250 gig hard drive, super drive, 9,400 M.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.680]   They claim a seven hour battery, which would be sweet.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.880]   It might be a mad imagination, but it looks a little bit thinner.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.960]   More memory has larger--
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.880]   It has the same tapered edges as all the other--
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.680]   Oh, you see what they're doing there doing that little--
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.960]   Yeah, that little optical illusion where the edge is just.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.240]   But it says 1.08 inches thin, 4.7 pounds.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.760]   And it's unibody, but it's polycarbonate unibody.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.320]   So I think this is, in a way, this
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.440]   is going to be a much more desirable computer, especially
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.480]   starting at $999.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.840]   They did not do the $600 or $700 laptop that people were hoping
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.600]   for, but that's not Apple, is it?
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.100]   No.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.840]   That's not the Apple we know and hate.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.720]   I mean, love.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.800]   Did I say, hey?
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.960]   Oh, I didn't mean to say that.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.560]   It was just a slip.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.480]   I think there's going to be a little bit of backlash.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.280]   I want to talk about Droid in just a little bit,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   which is the new phone from Verizon.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.320]   I think Verizon's kind of washing its hands of the iPhone.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.800]   I want to talk about that a little bit.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.840]   If there was discussion, I think that--
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.920]   The Droid puts that discussion to bed.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.160]   Bye-bye.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.440]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.600]   And if you guys, while I talk about go to a meeting,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.760]   want to do a little more research on the new hardware,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   we're just finding this out.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.040]   And then also we have some very good results from Apple.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.840]   I think they beat the market on this one a lot.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.080]   We should take a look at the stock price, too.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   But see if there's anything new in there.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.600]   The Magic Mouse.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.000]   How could I have forgotten?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.320]   You know, Gruber got this all right.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.560]   And Gruber yesterday, and Daring Fireball said,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.920]   I have a very good authority.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.760]   There's going to be this, this, this, this, and a Magic Mouse.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.720]   And I thought, OK, you had me until you said Magic Mouse.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.760]   You know?
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's when I thought, well, OK, we'll see John.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.280]   He was right.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.560]   There's a Magic Mouse.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.360]   I didn't like the Mighty Mouse.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.200]   Well, it really is going to have to be a feel
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.920]   if to test it out, sort of thing.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.800]   I mean, Apple has a history of building
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.600]   houses that look really great.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.040]   They photograph extremely well.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.720]   They keynote extremely well.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.600]   But about two days after having one on your desktop,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.480]   you're back down to the cheap little Microsoft
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.400]   mouse that you bought for about $18.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.440]   That's the one.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.320]   That's not exciting in any way, shape, or form.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.560]   But it's incredibly comfortable.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.280]   And it lasts for years and years, right?
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.360]   That's the one.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.600]   I was at the MIT flea market.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.200]   Someone had a bucket of them for two bucks.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.840]   Why not?
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.880]   And the balls never go bad because it's, you know,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880]   it's got the light in it.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.280]   So you don't have to worry about bad balls.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.160]   So why not?
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   I mean, this never wears out.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.800]   And it's-- frankly, it's got one, two, three, four, five buttons,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.480]   a scrolling wheel.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.520]   And the thing with the multitouch
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.400]   that I'm worried about is I'm worried about that, you know,
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.760]   I have enough trouble dealing with the multitouch now on my laptop.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   I don't want to add that to my reason.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.200]   There were rumors that would be--
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   There were rumors that would be--
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.400]   --that would be a mouse, so I don't have to deal with multitouch.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.880]   There were rumors that would be a multitouch kind of touchpad.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.960]   We didn't see that, did we?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.680]   You do the research.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.040]   Well, we're going to talk-- don't say--
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.520]   Go, go.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.840]   --commercial, go, go.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.600]   Zip, zip it, zip.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.280]   Because, yeah, I have to do a commercial
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   before we go too much farther.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.920]   We also want to talk about the new remote, redesigned remote.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.040]   You know, jobs comes back.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.360]   What I get is the feeling that there was a bunch of stuff
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.800]   kind of pent up.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   We were waiting for Steve to come back and say,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.640]   "Yay" or "Nay."
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.520]   And he said, "Okay, go, go, go."
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.760]   And there's all this new stuff.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.200]   Before we go much further, though, I
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.240]   want to mention our friends at Go to Meeting,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.440]   do more in travel less with Go to Meeting.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.520]   Lots of us-- gosh, I just got back from Vegas and Dubai.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.040]   If I could have used Go to Meeting, I would have.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.840]   I'm still jet lagged.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.440]   You know, all that travel and the expense.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.400]   If you're doing business travel, I love to travel.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.640]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.920]   But there's a difference between business travel
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.520]   and regular travel.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.840]   Business travel is almost an oxymoron.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.000]   It's like, lock me in a can and send me somewhere at great expense
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.560]   so I could be exhausted.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.080]   Or even if you're just driving across town
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.920]   for a couple of hours, you know, go to Meeting,
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.680]   replaces all that.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.520]   It makes your meetings as good as in-person meetings.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.120]   You're very engaging.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.320]   It's as if you're in the room with your people.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.640]   You can show them the sales presentation, the keynote.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.040]   It's great for product demos, training,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.920]   collaborating on documents.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.040]   $49 for all the meetings you want.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.000]   And that includes free phone and voice over IP conferencing.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.600]   But wait.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.280]   But wait.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.160]   I've got a better deal.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.240]   How about a month free?
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.200]   Just go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   You could try it free.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.320]   It'll install in minutes.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.760]   There's no configuration.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.120]   Just boom, it works.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.000]   And then the next time you're on the phone with somebody
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.240]   saying, I wish I could show you this, a little come on.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.560]   You say, wait, I can.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.440]   Go to go to meeting.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.680]   Click the join a meeting button.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.000]   And now you're seeing what I'm seeing.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.840]   And it just, it transforms your meetings.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.880]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.840]   Do me a favor.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.120]   What do you got to lose?
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.960]   From the folks at Citrix, we thank them for their support.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.040]   For Mac Break Weekly.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.200]   Andy, can you describe what is so magic
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.440]   about the magic mouse?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.920]   Mostly magic mouse is mostly multi-touch.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.520]   Oh, why is your name start with the am-
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.960]   with the original iteration?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.080]   Hey, Mr. Leo.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.480]   So imagine one of these only without that and that and that.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.640]   Oh, and of course, and without that.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.000]   So it's going to have a touch sensitive surface to it
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.040]   so that it will, in addition to the usual left button,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.240]   mouse button, the right button type of clicks,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.560]   it will also understand swipes that the library that's
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.240]   pretty similar to what you have in the trackpad today,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.040]   the press releases are talking about.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.280]   It's like if you're in preview, you can swipe with two fingers
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.200]   left and right to scroll.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.680]   Let's scroll the page left and right.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.760]   It's pretty pretty.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.800]   I mean, it looks good.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.560]   It looks cool, especially from the bottom.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.320]   What I'm waiting to see is how does it get the mechanical tap?
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.200]   The big waterloo of their previous mouse
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.760]   is was that the way that was designed, instead of having
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.040]   a distinct button here and here, that works independently
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.800]   of the base of the mouse, essentially, the entire surface
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.280]   was the mouse button.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.120]   So that unless you had the entire surface
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.160]   in a very, very stable configuration,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.840]   it wouldn't register a click.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.600]   And so, first of all, if you were in a click and drag
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.200]   sort of operation, that was almost impossible to pull off
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.560]   of the previous mouse's.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.200]   So every time someone comes to me,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.680]   Apple or no, with a really clever idea for a mouse,
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.160]   I'm like, OK, I'll listen and I'll come with an open mind.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.440]   But by and large, again, the best indication of my feelings
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.360]   are that I have this cheap little Microsoft mouse attached
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.320]   to my iMac right now.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.280]   There's something about buttons that's just reassuring
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.400]   and this virtuality is just makes me nervous.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.800]   But we have to try it, right?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.640]   I do.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.280]   I kind of intrigued by the idea.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.120]   I mean, the fact that you could stroke your mouse just
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.200]   makes me feel--
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.080]   I think mechanical buttons are really important.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.520]   There has to be a very, very distinctive difference
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.880]   to the interface between tapping something
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.480]   to actually just make contact and move it
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.600]   and actually clicking to select it.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.320]   Because my big frustrations, only partly fixed in 10.6,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.960]   is that now that I have a MacBook that has no separate
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.760]   mechanical mouse button, it's always--
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.840]   the trackpad is always misinterpreting just me shifting
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.880]   my hands on the keyboard, too.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.800]   Oh, he wants me to zoom in on Safari.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.200]   Oh, driving me crazy.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   I want you to do that.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.360]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.240]   Everybody I know is driving me crazy.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.720]   This kind of-- and my icons are keep getting small in my laptop.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.000]   So here's a question for you.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.080]   For all of you, how many of you use gestures on your trackpad
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   on your notebook?
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.400]   Is that something you do?
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.920]   Not on purpose.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.680]   I mean, on purpose.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.760]   I mean, the only one I use is I do do the scrolling
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   with two fingers.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.040]   But everything else--
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.160]   But that's it.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.920]   I mean, everything else drives me--
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.440]   The four finger, the two finger.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.800]   I mean, it's the pinch.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.280]   It's crazy.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.800]   Well, and what happened is I said,
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.200]   it would constantly get in--
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.800]   I think I've turned everything off
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.200]   and the preferences that I can turn off.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.680]   I'm still getting--
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.320]   It's a pinch gesture as somebody told me.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.400]   I don't know what it is.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   The icons in Safari gets small and the icons get small.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.920]   And order the text gets really big or--
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.520]   Spontaneous.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.600]   And it's--
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.400]   So there is a mechanical click, right?
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.960]   It's hard to tell from the video.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.680]   And if you go to apple.com/magicmouse,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920]   you can watch the video.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.840]   But there seems to be a mechanical clicking thing.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.920]   Oh, look, you press the control and you can zoom in and out.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.720]   But that's like a-- OK, that's a scroll wheel.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   So it's all virtualized.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.040]   Yeah, I expect to get one soon.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.400]   I expect to try it out.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.040]   But when you have the same hand that
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.400]   has to push this thing around, when that hand is also
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.920]   responsible for doing complex inputs on the surface of it,
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.600]   that's going to be, at best, I think, a retraining process.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.880]   But we won't know until we actually see it.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.520]   $69 available now, I'm going to order one today, right?
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.680]   In fact, I think I might order that $27.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.600]   I'm going to like that.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   I should replace this one with that one.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.880]   Yeah, I think you do.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.000]   Just from a health point in the--
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.840]   And when you look at this new--
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   I really think that Apple is-- when
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.920]   you look at the new Apple remote--
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.080]   Oh, let's look at the remote.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.920]   OK, next remote.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Slightly longer remote, it is being released.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.960]   But the fact that Apple's spending a lot of energy
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.080]   working on our remote, and the fact
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.560]   that you have Visa on the 27-inch,
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.600]   I don't think that there's--
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.280]   There's one TV, baby.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   I don't think this one's a head-to-head with TV.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.240]   But I think that that is the direction Apple is going,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.520]   is that we're going to slowly embed all the things
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.640]   that you like about your computer and with your TV.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.960]   Because when you look at what Front Row does,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   it really allows you to just have a relatively a TV experience,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.920]   kind of a simplified TV experience, which is--
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.680]   I have to admit, about 80% of our TV experience now is Roku.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.760]   So it's about the same--
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   Now, I have to point out, I'm hearing really good things
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.480]   about Windows 7 and Touch.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.280]   Windows 7 really is Touch-enabled.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.880]   And there are a number of notebooks
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.320]   coming out with touch screens.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.880]   And this is--
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.120]   So this is-- I was a little surprised.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.560]   You don't mean multi-touch.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.960]   Multi-touch on the screen and on the screen, yeah.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.280]   OK, because I have a window--
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   Pinch and all that.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.720]   I put Windows 7 on my laptop.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.760]   You need to put it on a Touch-enabled laptop.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.160]   And there are a number of new coming out.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.920]   I was at Microsoft as the New England Research and Development
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.320]   Center, which is known as the Nerd Center, actually,
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.400]   in Cambridge.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.000]   And so I was with developers a couple weeks ago.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.120]   And they showed me a brand new laptop that's
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   the most touch-enabled laptop ever,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.000]   just to show how ambitious the touch support is in Windows.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.800]   And they had five-finger support.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   It's pretty incredible.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.160]   So I want-- yeah, I mean, you can actually
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.840]   put all five fingers on the screen and just drag it around.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.880]   And you will be-- it recognizes and will track all five
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.120]   fingers at the same time.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.760]   Whether or not the future hardware and software
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.440]   will really support it and make good use of it
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.120]   is another thing.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.520]   Well, a number of notebooks-- I know
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.360]   Acer, I think Fujitsu are coming-- a number of notebooks
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   are out.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.120]   So let's--
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.480]   Yeah, that's the other scary things.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.880]   Remember that they have a Microsoft services technology
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.920]   in their library.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.680]   That's that pool table that we saw the video of,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.200]   where you sit around the pool table
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.960]   and you put your phone on with this one side of it
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.760]   and now your photos start to appear,
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.920]   which is terrible as a $12,000 thing
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.400]   that you're going to have to convince people
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.680]   to actually buy news.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.360]   But it's actually kind of a slick interface.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.360]   And if they can wire that up in a meaningful way
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.800]   inside of tablets, I would certainly not
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.960]   mind having a device that finds my camera via Bluetooth
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.640]   or via Wi-Fi or just by USB, gives me a pile of photos
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.560]   that I can then just simply manually sort through
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.080]   and just put into the keep file, put into the throw away
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.240]   file and just basically drag these things around it
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   to other other platforms.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.160]   I think we got a horse race, which I think is good for everybody.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.840]   I like it that Microsoft is not sitting back.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.280]   I think Windows 7 is going to be a very big challenge for Apple.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.680]   So let's get back-- getting back to this remote.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.640]   Besides just being bigger, their buttons are the same, right?
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.200]   It's got menu and it's got a--
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.000]   it looks a little more like a nano kind of play and pause
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and then a four position rocker and a menu button.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.800]   So what's new?
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.640]   I think it's just the read-- go ahead.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.080]   It's longer.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.760]   All I was going to say is that just--
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.880]   all I've known about it for now is just the shape of it.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.600]   And already, that's a big improvement.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.560]   It works more like a media--
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.800]   like a living remote than just something that
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.400]   came free with your laptop.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.640]   The fact that it's high contrast input areas
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   means that it'll be easier to find and control when you're
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.320]   using this thing in a low light situation.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.480]   So already, it's two steps up.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.080]   If you have the iPod dock, it'll work with that
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.400]   so you can use your phone with it.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.320]   I guess it's just a redesign.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.400]   I mean, just looking at it, it just
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.120]   looks like it's the same function that roughly
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.800]   the same functionality.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.840]   A lot of products, boy.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.800]   This was a big--
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.360]   And they didn't do a--
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.480]   they could have done a Steve Jobs presentation with this much
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.200]   stuff.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.920]   It's interesting that they chose not to just slide that.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.960]   Well, it does seem that they really
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   focus those events on the iPod, iPhone, maybe the iPad line.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.800]   That's where they want to focus people's energy.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.520]   And I think that with the computers,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.960]   the computers are still growing in sales.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.000]   I mean, I think we're going to talk about the finances.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.640]   But the computers are growing in sales,
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.840]   but I think they're downplaying that in some ways.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.000]   It's a consumer company.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.600]   Well, I'm just relieved because it's very clear that they are
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.520]   still developing the Mac.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.760]   The Mac is still a big part of their product line.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.160]   This is a great refresh.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.440]   I think the new Mac book is pretty sweet.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   At $9.99, this is light.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.800]   All of these are great value.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.680]   When you look at a 21.5-inch Mac for $11.99, it's--
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.040]   I think this is a good consumer choice.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.960]   Now, I should note all the new iMacs require snow leopard.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.000]   They come with snow leopard.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.680]   But if you have a compatibility issue,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.240]   if you have software that you need to use--
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.120]   I use one password, and you have to use a beta
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.000]   because they have-- it's odd with it--
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.400]   how long it's been out that they--
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.760]   and beta that they haven't had it fixed.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.600]   But there are a number of programs that don't work.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.640]   None of the drivers we use for the Axia work,
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.880]   so I have to use leopard.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.200]   So I can't, in fact--
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.760]   I can't upgrade this Mac.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.680]   Oh, because you can't--
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.560]   Because I can't use snow.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.840]   I need to continue to use leopard on it.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.720]   Well, I'll give it to you then.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.800]   You don't mind.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.680]   You could just have it.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.160]   The 27.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.160]   Thanks.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.000]   I already ordered it, so you might as well just take it.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.520]   Sure.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.640]   I have a nice--
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.160]   Thanks.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.920]   The beta works fine, everybody's saying,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.560]   I know it works fine, but it's still not the--
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.800]   they have not released a version that
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.040]   works with snow leopard.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.000]   And the driver, there is no beta or anything.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.880]   That's actually the showstopper.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.840]   So Apple's quarterly results are out.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.200]   What is it?
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.400]   47% growth.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.840]   That's a lot.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.280]   From over last year, which was already good.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   So they're--
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.160]   Net profit is $1.6 billion with a B.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.920]   That's profit.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.560]   That's the profit off of a revenue of almost $10 billion.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.080]   I mean, at the rate they're going in $5 billion--
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.840]   They're almost as rich as I am.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.200]   Well, close.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.680]   We need to talk about the check I just got there.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.520]   Thanks for the jacket.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.600]   I love the jacket.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.920]   But--
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.360]   No, no, no.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.240]   I was joking.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.680]   Joking.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   For legal purposes, Leo was joking.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   Yes.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.400]   And they're predicting a better quarter next year.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.080]   I mean, or all that.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.960]   Well, all the PC manufacturers were up.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.240]   So the sales are inching up now.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.080]   But Apple, that's not an inch.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.880]   That's a mile.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.760]   That's a big job.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.040]   I believe they said that they've grown 19--
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.200]   they've outgrown the PC market 19 of 20 quarters.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.400]   So it's basically almost the last--
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.480]   They're almost a 10% market share now.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.840]   3.1 million Mac computers in three months.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.400]   That's a million a month.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.280]   That's a 19% increase over a year over a year.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.560]   iPhone really pushed this.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.080]   What a success the iPhone has proven to be.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.480]   7.4 million.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.560]   That's half a million more than last year at this time.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.400]   7.4 million iPhones in three months.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.560]   And it's not like the--
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.440]   I mean, it came out in June.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.040]   It's not like--
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.320]   let's see, three months would be June, July, August.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   So it would be the first quarter of the 3GS sales.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   Not Chabby.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.200]   And then, of course, now, the other thing
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.520]   is at the end of this month, they
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.160]   start selling the iPhone in China.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.640]   Right.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.680]   Huge market there.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.120]   In China, all the geeks that I met had iPhones are ready.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.000]   They had unlocked.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.760]   Same thing in Dubai.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.280]   I was surprised at how many iPhones.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.000]   And the day I got there, they announced
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.840]   that they were going to be selling in Dubai two days and two
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.120]   days.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.640]   So they're pretty much everywhere now, I think, worldwide.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.240]   As soon as they started selling unlocked phones that
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.320]   were really unlocked in some countries,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.520]   those things just became hot commodities all over the world.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   And they don't break down the sales.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   We don't know how much of this was the $100 iPhone.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.240]   I don't think they have that broken down.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:41.920]   They don't really.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.800]   They never like to--
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   I bet you it's a very large percentage of those.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.480]   That's where I really saw, anecdotally, in the airport
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.560]   in downtown San Francisco, in New York,
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.360]   in places that I've been recently.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.000]   When I really saw this jump where you just feel like everybody's
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.280]   got an iPhone as when the 99-- it was post the $99.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.360]   And the other thing about that 10% market share,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.560]   that's because it's including business.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.480]   If you just walk around and see people in coffee shops and stuff,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.400]   there's more-- it's almost half max, right?
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.760]   More than half max at least in the Bay Area.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.120]   What's it like in Boston?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.920]   A lot of max?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.960]   Well, definitely.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.360]   Well, it's a big college town.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.560]   So there's probably going to be a disproportionate amount
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.800]   of max in Cambridge and Brookline in Boston.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.680]   But you do see a good number of Windows machines,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.080]   especially in the network class.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.840]   The netbooks.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   Yeah, that's what's keeping Windows alive.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.920]   The UBS has raised Apple's stock price target 2.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.400]   You want to take a guess?
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.160]   It's 200 now, right?
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.720]   I've seen some targets that are out of 240, 280.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.160]   280.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.360]   280 is what UBS is saying.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.040]   Currently, Apple is at 199.29.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.080]   So if the target is 280, this--
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.880]   I don't know an Apple stock, but if Mr. Scott Bourne
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.960]   were here, he'd probably be saying.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.240]   They've doubled in a year.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.480]   Apple's doubled at stock price.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   Well, they were at 200, though.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.400]   Remember, they were at 200.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.760]   They were at 200.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.800]   But a lot of people aren't back.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.760]   They feel that's true.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.720]   They're quite a few people who learn that back.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.200]   Right.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.480]   Big jump in price of $10 due to the earnings announcement.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.560]   But I think you're going to see some growth.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.520]   And you know, the max sales outpaced.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   Yeah, it's the 2% growth for the PC market
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.200]   in the quarter.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.160]   And Apple was 47?
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.440]   4% growth in profit.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.120]   I don't know what the sales growth--
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.760]   You have the 12% growth.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.120]   They're very profitable.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.600]   Apple's up $9.51, it has a 5% growth over yesterday.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.160]   But you've got to think it's going to even be more.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.640]   It's interesting.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.000]   No, that's good.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.600]   I mean, Apple's having successful quarters.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.520]   So let's make sure we set expectations so high
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.160]   that they can't possibly meet them.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.000]   Send the stock price back down to $93,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.520]   where we can all finally buy stock.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.000]   No, Apple's good at--
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.120]   Apple's very good.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.280]   You notice that they way exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.520]   Apple's been very good at under-promising and over-delivering.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.960]   They're very good at lowering expectations.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   And you think Wall Street would have caught on by now.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.720]   That it's clear that they do that.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.480]   Look at this.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   Well, they--
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:22.920]   This chart that I'm showing right now is the year to date.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.840]   It could year to date growth.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.600]   One year, two years, this is when they were at $200 before,
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.040]   was in June of--
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.400]   what is that?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.240]   2008?
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.760]   Yeah, 2008, maybe.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.520]   Yeah, May 2008.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.360]   Was there last over $200.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.800]   Big gate over like that with the stock.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.320]   Actually, they were at this price in December 2007.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.400]   They haven't been at this price since December 2007.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:49.920]   And it's--
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.200]   I can't get two graphs on there, Ken.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.160]   You can't put the New York Stock Exchange on there as well.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.920]   I could probably do that if I were sophisticated.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.680]   You want me to add the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.280]   I think it would be interesting to see as a comparison.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.920]   All right, let me.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.840]   My magic mouse ain't some magic right now.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   I don't know.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.280]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.640]   I can't click.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.880]   Click.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.200]   I can't click.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   Show--
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.280]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   They'll get you nicely enhanced for the new mouse.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.080]   That's good.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.320]   I can't click.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.760]   Look at that.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.000]   I just can't-- it's no.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.240]   It's some sort of weird Ajax issue.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.920]   Anyway, I could if Yahoo would let me.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.840]   But Yahoo's apparently stuck in the hand mode.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.480]   Talk to the hand, it says.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.760]   OK, now let's see if I can-- no.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.600]   I can't even get out of this.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.680]   Sorry.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.080]   If stuck it, it's broken.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   It didn't mean to stay in--
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.360]   That's what I get to use for using Safari.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.400]   Even escape doesn't escape.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.600]   Nothing's escaping from this.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.480]   I just have to close the window.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.160]   OK, let's try Google Finance.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.360]   Now we're obsessed.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.600]   Now I got to know.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.560]   Anything else to report for those results?
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.880]   I think that's pretty much the story right there.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.720]   AAPL.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.520]   What do you use to look at stock quotes, Andy?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.800]   I don't have indigivisible stocks in the really bad.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.880]   I have your basic walk into the bank, hand them a pile of money,
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.800]   and say, please make sure I'm not poor when I'm 80.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   Investment's up.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   Yeah, really.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.400]   So usually, when I do need to look at that sort of stuff,
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.120]   I usually just go right to my iPhone.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.240]   OK, so since October 22, 2004, the Dow Jones Industrial
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.160]   Average is up 2.74%.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.960]   You want to take a guess at how much Apple's up since 2004
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.600]   in the last five years?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.240]   774%.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   Year to date, Dow up 8% Apple up 100%.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.040]   Oh, no, that's a year to date Dow up 14% Apple up 13%.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.440]   What's over the last five years?
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:54.160]   Last five years, 774% increase in Apple stock price.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.000]   What about the last?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.400]   10 years, 957%.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.600]   The Dow's down 5% over 10 years ago.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.400]   So if you--
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.240]   There you go.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   This is the max.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.360]   This is since Apple's IPO, which is in 1980.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.800]   If you bought Apple stock--
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.320]   You did OK.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.960]   In 1980, if you bought a dollar's worth of Apple stock,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.760]   you'd be worth 5--
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.640]   What is that? 5,435% more.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.240]   So that'd be worth $54, right?
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   $54 times growth.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   I know I'm going to get an email.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.400]   Everybody says, every time I say do math on the air,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.040]   there we go.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.720]   You're more on.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.400]   You know that?
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.720]   I'm doing it live, folks.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.000]   I don't have a calculator in my head.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.480]   And I'm old.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.160]   Base like that.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.200]   You think he was hard for his brain?
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.440]   I'm hard for my looks.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   You can tell.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.200]   He's the teller.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:44.700]   All right.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.520]   Good news for Apple all around, I have to say.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.240]   I think just off the surface, a very impressive product launch.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.640]   And I think compelling prices--
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.600]   you know, they're still more expensive than PCs.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.960]   But they needed to do something-- of course,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.640]   it's telling they do this two days before Windows 7 comes out.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.240]   There's a slew of new PCs on Thursday.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.320]   They're going to need some goodwill in the marketplace
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.080]   because they're being attacked on the OS front
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.480]   and they're being attacked on the mobile front.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.520]   And both of these people have really
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.240]   good anti-Apple bullets to fire.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.960]   Again, competition is great for us as users.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.320]   Absolutely.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.280]   And I love it that Windows is competitive.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.840]   I love it that Apple feels the pressure to come up
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.960]   with lower prices.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.760]   And Google and all of this stuff.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   Yeah, well, let's talk about that.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.680]   So if you've gone to the website--
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.920]   and it's a Verizon website--
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.800]   DroidDoesDROIDDOS.com.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   This is the little mini ad you'll see.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   Remember, this is from Verizon.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.640]   I don't run simultaneous apps.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.160]   I don't take night shots.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.760]   I don't allow open development.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.080]   I don't customize.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.440]   I don't run widgets.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.040]   I don't have interchangeable batteries.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.360]   Everything I don't--
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.080]   DroidDoesDROIDDOS.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.320]   This is the new HTC phone.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   Sholes was the code name.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.040]   Verizon's going to start selling it.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.360]   We think October 30th.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.000]   There's this magic creepy code here
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.880]   that you can't figure out.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   It's a binary clock.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.120]   But everybody who's decoded it says October 30th.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.600]   Droid is very similar looking to the iPhone.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.640]   It's got a big touch screen.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.400]   But slide out full-size--
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.000]   not full-size, but full-size for the phone.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Keyboard.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.520]   Big keyboard.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.120]   Not one of those little blackberry keyboards or palm
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.440]   keyboards.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.320]   It's like a full-phone-size keyboard.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.520]   5 megapixel camera.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.760]   It's running the same ARM processor
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.400]   that the iPhone 3GS and the Palm pre are.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.440]   So it's going to be as fast as them.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.520]   It's running on the Verizon network,
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.120]   as opposed to the AT&T network.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.040]   I don't know if it's LTE or not.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.640]   That's Verizon's rolling out of 4G network soon.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.080]   I mean, isn't this a big up yours to Apple?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.320]   I mean, Verizon said we're going to have the iPhone
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.560]   early 2010.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.680]   This sure doesn't look like they're in the iPhone camp.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.920]   Well, remember that that wasn't really an announcement.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.680]   So much as a loose executive's trying
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.560]   to get some attention, I think.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.480]   It's a seriously nice looking phone.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.040]   The specs are way up there.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.400]   More than anything else, it's the debut--
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.600]   the first commercial debut of Android 2.0.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.280]   And that operating system just keeps building and building
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.320]   momentum, appearing on more and more devices.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.840]   And as Google has greater success
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.560]   in evangelizing this operating system, not just to phones,
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.920]   but also to laptops, to e-book readers, to tablet PCs,
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.480]   it's going to become a far more attractive target
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.200]   than it already is for developers who are trying to think,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.040]   gee, if I've got $2,000 and a summer
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040]   to spend learning how to develop for a certain class
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.600]   of mobile devices, am I going to learn
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.360]   how to develop for Apple's touch devices,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.560]   or am I going to learn to develop for Android devices?
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.080]   That's to me an interesting question.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   You've got 85,000 apps.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.360]   Some of these guys are making a lot of money
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.200]   in the Apple Store, right?
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.920]   So as a developer, it's pretty--
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.560]   I mean, what I think the question, though,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.160]   is that how many people play the lottery that pays--
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   It is a lot of pays in it.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.440]   It pays 40 million versus the lottery that pays $500.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.360]   But do we know anybody who's making money in the Android
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.600]   Store?
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.640]   No.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.080]   I don't really know myself, but the other part
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.560]   of that equation is the pretty much assuredness
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.200]   that if I invest-- if I software development company
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.280]   invest four months worth of my team's time
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.320]   and God knows how many tens of thousands of dollars
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.000]   in developing an Android app, they're not
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.280]   going to be arbitrarily locked out of the store
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.760]   for stupid silly reasons.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.160]   I have to correct myself, by the way.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.680]   This is a Motorola phone.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.480]   I said HTC is not an HTC.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.760]   It's a Motorola shows, which is interesting,
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.520]   because Motorola kind of got out of the phone business
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.160]   for a while.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.360]   I don't know what to expect with this.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.440]   Well, it also means that maybe this thing will actually
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.000]   have a headphone jack.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.600]   Yay!
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600]   God.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.000]   I really wanted to like Android, and the G1
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.040]   was just not a good phone for the jack and other reasons.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.400]   I mean, I think that the problem that I have--
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.120]   and I've been using a couple different phones,
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.160]   just playing around with them.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.960]   And the issue that I really have
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.320]   is that it's not that they don't have the same features
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.960]   or a lot of the features that the iPhone has.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.440]   The fit and finish is just not there.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.320]   That's the--
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.000]   Fit and finish.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.440]   You mean software fit finish.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   It's not the hardware.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.100]   Really?
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.040]   The way that--
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.720]   I think the iPhone feels a little clunky.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.040]   I think the iPhone could be.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.400]   I don't know.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.840]   I go back to my iPhone, and I just feel like it's moving.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.920]   And I'm able to get-- I use all these apps,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.360]   and I open the apps, and they all have a pretty good interface.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.520]   And some of the other phones that I've been playing with,
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.600]   I just feel like they're not as smooth.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:42.400]   And I feel like there's lots of little things that kind of--
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.920]   No, I agree.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.600]   I think the user experience is superior on the iPhone, all
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.200]   in all.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.080]   Well, and I think that's what they're missing.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.280]   I think they need to get--
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.320]   I mean, I think the pre is probably the closest one
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   that is taking that one.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   Pre is pretty cool.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.960]   I don't gather that the pre is doing very well.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.160]   And remember that the whole web OS operating system,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.920]   that's one phone that supports it, whereas, again,
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.320]   if you learn how to develop--
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.120]   there's a lot of momentum on Android.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.680]   Android is Linux, so really, in a way,
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   a lot of people already know how to develop for it.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.920]   In addition to that, there's the fact
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.560]   that it is so open from a hardware standard.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.960]   One of my real grills in a handheld phone
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.480]   is the ability to simply attach a mechanical keyboard
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.280]   if I want it.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   And although previous editions of the operating system
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.280]   did not even support a Bluetooth keyboard that didn't
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.920]   have that as part of the stack, it
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.760]   was at least possible to develop that and install that
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.800]   as an add-on.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   2.0, I believe-- I need to refresh myself on the specs.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.840]   But I believe that Bluetooth support for keyboards
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.280]   is supposed to be built in.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   Oh.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.080]   So--
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.280]   That has a keyboard.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.160]   But I think that's something that Apple could easily done.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.320]   Well, it's like not having a 2D P for it.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.120]   Right.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.680]   That seems like more of a philosophical thing
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.960]   I think else is trying to believe--
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   It's way to--
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.760]   This is the right way to go.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   And the typical--
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   The typical Apple.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.720]   We know what's best for you.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.760]   So just sit down and take it.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.920]   And the frustrating thing is that they're often right.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:08.280]   But a phone is such a different device than a laptop.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.240]   The biggest asset that the iPhone has
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.640]   is the fact that it has--
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.960]   outside from the fact you can take it into any Apple store
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.400]   and they'll fix it for you--
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.640]   is the fact that it has that huge library full of really
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.960]   mature, well-put-together applications.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.200]   But that's more of a big positive for a notebook
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.480]   or a desktop and a phone.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.320]   On the phone, I only use probably about six or seven apps
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.680]   on a day-to-day basis.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.240]   If Android-- the Android store had--
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.280]   Android Marketplace had these four or five apps that I
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.800]   liked just as well as the versions that I have on the iPhone,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.640]   the advantage of the App Store wouldn't go away completely,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   but it would sincerely fade down.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.920]   Well, but I think the problem with that
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.840]   is that those six apps are a lot different for all of us.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.800]   I mean, the issue you get into in the record store
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.120]   is that 100-- there's 100 acts that represent 95%
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.480]   of what everybody walks in to buy in an average brick-and-mortar
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.600]   record store.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.000]   But if they only had those 100 CDs,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.720]   they would fail.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.600]   So they have to--
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.720]   the-- I don't know if we need 85,000 apps,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.440]   but you have to have an awful lot to get--
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.040]   It's tough.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.040]   To the ones that each one of us--
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.360]   Now, Android is more mature than the Web OS store.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.400]   I mean, at least Android's been out for a while and has some stuff.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.320]   But it's not the greatest stuff in the world.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.160]   But I think that if-- I'm with you, Andy.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.720]   If I'm a developer, I'm rooting for Android big time.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.000]   Well, I think that as a professional developer,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.960]   we want to develop some kind of high-end stuff.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.320]   And I definitely agree that we may have to go to the Android
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.960]   to be able to--
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.040]   You want to be open because Apple--
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.440]   Well, because you don't know what Apple do.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.200]   There's interface issues that we need to make sure that--
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.240]   But there's also this big--
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.440]   this big elephant in the room that you can write a--
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.920]   Apple does not tell you--
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.760]   I was talking to one of our sponsors.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.480]   I won't name names.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.800]   Apple's holding onto their-- they have a great application.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.760]   They show me it's beautiful.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.800]   And Apple's holding onto it because they don't like an icon.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.600]   At first, they liked it.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.880]   Now they don't like it.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.960]   That's frustrating.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.560]   You don't have that problem on Android.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.400]   Right.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   You don't.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.640]   It's just that it--
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.280]   Yeah, there's a better user experience in Apple
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.440]   because they control it so tightly.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.480]   But as a developer, I'm saying, well, gosh, it's unpredictable.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.560]   I could spend money developing a product
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.280]   that I can never release.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   Right.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   Go ahead.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.480]   This is such an interesting three, four month span of time,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.360]   not only with the release of Android 2.0 and this--
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.600]   hopefully this great new phone, but also every single tablet
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.720]   that's coming out in the next three, four months,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.960]   every single book reader that's coming out in the next three,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.280]   four months, it sounds as though there's
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.080]   going to be a big point of singularity in which the future
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.760]   finally collapses in on itself and only one or two people
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.960]   emerge from it.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.120]   And whatever Apple does next with the iPhone operating system
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.200]   or the touch operating system is going
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.720]   to cause the existing iPhones to make more sense
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.040]   and these competing phones to either be validated or be
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.280]   rendered irrelevant.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.600]   Well, we'll watch with great interest.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.800]   I'm glad to see what Verizon's doing.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.760]   I'm going to run out and buy one.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.800]   Of course, a minute it comes out.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.400]   Just crossing my fingers.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.800]   We've seen a lot of--
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.360]   and I've fallen for a lot of quote iPhone killers,
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.800]   including the Blackberry Storm and the Sprint Instinct,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.960]   both of which were not so hot.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   This could just be another one.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.920]   But the difference is this is running Android,
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.440]   which might make a big difference.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.880]   Have you seen just out of curiosity,
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.080]   the Vincent LaFlore's 1D Mark 2 video?
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.560]   I saw it last night.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.000]   The natural-- this isn't really a Macintosh.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.520]   This is the--
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.440]   This is the speaker photography.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.880]   It's a little break out for this.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.400]   But Canon's released to 1D.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.520]   They've announced they're going to do firmware updates
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.360]   for the Mark 2 5D to 24 and 25P, which will be nice.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.240]   They did finally-- was that announcement yesterday?
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.600]   Well, and ganja says so.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   I'm on the air.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.960]   But the thing about this video is it shot natural light,
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.600]   ambient light.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.200]   I think he said he used one reflector on the girl.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.640]   But outside of that, it was all natural light.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.680]   So what is different from the 1D and the 5D?
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.240]   It's still a full frame sensor, right?
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.160]   It's not any different there.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.480]   The 1D and the 5D--
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.560]   1D probably has faster--
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.040]   The 1D has-- the low light goes up to 102,000.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.760]   This is a 3D-- a Nikon 3D killer.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.880]   Well, they had a release.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.720]   The D3S just was released so earlier.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.440]   The D3 has amazing low light performance,
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.480]   better than that Canon.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.240]   Well, we don't know.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.800]   We haven't gone head to head with this new one.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.400]   The new one's-- this new Canon.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.600]   You know, he was-- in this movie,
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.040]   he said that he shot almost the whole thing.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.280]   It's 6400i, so he said 6400 is really the new 1600,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.760]   or even the new 800.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.200]   It doesn't look grainy, but you know, I mean, it's a--
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.720]   The thing about film is, grain isn't as big a deal.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.280]   You almost-- I mean, we're used to old movies
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   with lots of grain, and it's kind of part of the thing.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.240]   Anyway, I just thought I'd mention it.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.080]   It's not really apropos.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.640]   We'll save it for this weekend photography.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.880]   It does look good, though.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.320]   No, it looks really good.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.920]   Of course, Vincent's the guy who did the original 5D Mark
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.880]   2 video that everybody blew everybody away.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.600]   He's clearly, you know, he's racking focus in this
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.080]   and doing all sorts of stuff that I cannot do.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.920]   I cannot do a smooth focus rack to save my life on the 5D.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.200]   Well, a lot of times when you're doing a rack focus, by the way,
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.280]   you know, you're measuring it first,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.480]   and then you're going to a point together.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.400]   And you have a tie.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.320]   You have a focus puller.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.080]   There's a guy doing it.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.120]   I don't know what they did here, but--
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.400]   They probably put a little-- you know, a handle on the thing,
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.600]   and they get it locked down, and there's a guy pulling focus
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.320]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.280]   When we're shooting, oftentimes, we have a remote control
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.560]   with a little focus that's hooked to it.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:34.920]   So you just--
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.800]   I wish you could do that with--
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.640]   Can you do that with a 5D?
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   No.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.960]   You can have remote control focus?
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.920]   Well, what you do is, well, it's a--
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.800]   you hook a thing to the lens, and then you hook a little motor
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.760]   to the lens, and then that motor to remote control,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.680]   and then you back up.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.720]   So it's all doable.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.280]   But I don't know.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.600]   I know that Stu Mashowitz, my own office, made it at ILM,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.440]   was worked with him on this project.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   He's a good filmmaker, too.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.600]   I love his storyteller.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.000]   All right, we're going to get to our picks of the week
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.720]   in just a bit.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.760]   And I'm sure you all have some wonderful ones.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.040]   I have one I'm very excited about.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.240]   That's an iPhone app.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.480]   I haven't done an iPhone App in ages.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.240]   That's been your province for the last few episodes, Alex.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.960]   But I'm going to do one.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.040]   So I don't know.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.080]   Are you doing an iPhone app, too?
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.600]   No.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.520]   Good.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.600]   So there's this space for me to do that.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.200]   Yes.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our good friends
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.640]   at audible.com, the great audible.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:36.880]   We love them. Audible is the online bookstore of audiobooks.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.440]   I need a new account of how many books.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.400]   The last time I checked 60,000.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.800]   But I'm sure it's more than that.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.560]   The point is, it's like a bookstore online.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.840]   It's a wonderful source of great audiobooks.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.120]   And you can go there right now, audible.com and browse around.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.960]   But when you're ready, when you want to try it,
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:03.880]   I want you to go to audible.com/macbreak, audible.com/macbreak,
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.960]   and get your free book.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.360]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.200]   And that gives you one book a month.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.840]   And the first one's free.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.320]   You've got to like that.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.840]   Somebody just texted me.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.760]   I'm going to let you do a pic.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.880]   I'm sure you have a pic, right, Andy?
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.000]   I always have a pic.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.800]   I can wait till next week.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.600]   Well, I'm going to let you do a pic.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.680]   But I just got a text from a student who says,
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.560]   when you get to your audible pic,
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.040]   would you guys suggest a book on work-life balance?
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:31.560]   Thanks.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.040]   Stressed out student.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.800]   And there's a big self-help category on there.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.280]   The first thing that left him on--
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.080]   That's the first thing that left him on.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.600]   Is Tim Ferris' book on the four-hour work week?
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.000]   And I think he's updated.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.760]   I don't know if this is the updated one.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.720]   I don't think it's out yet.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.280]   Escape 9 to 5, live anywhere, and join the new rich.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.640]   Now, Timothy has kind of had a head start in all this.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.240]   But he's pretty amazing.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.200]   And look, let's put it this way.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.760]   This is an inspirational book, maybe not a pattern for how
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.520]   you will be living your life.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.600]   It's great to think about it.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   Think about what you're doing.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.280]   Think about what you're doing.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.720]   So that's a start.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:09.040]   But what do you have, Andy, Ihhennathko?
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.440]   This is an old favorite.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.320]   One of the things I like about Audible is that oftentimes,
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.600]   I'll just remember a book that I enjoyed 10 years ago
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.720]   and say, I wonder if it's on Audible?
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.080]   Yes, it's on Audible.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.160]   One of my favorite biographies, it's
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.880]   Marian Mead's biography of Dorothy Parker.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.400]   And she has such great skill in taking an entire life
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.600]   and making it read as though this person
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.520]   were a fictional character in a novel, which, yes, in many ways
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.000]   makes me wonder if she's not oversimplifying her subject.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.040]   That's always a worry when every someone
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.960]   writes about someone's life and that whole life makes
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.160]   consistent sense than, well, that's--
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.520]   That's a little suspicious, isn't it?
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.040]   And I have to say, Dorothy Parker, who
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.360]   wrote for The New Yorker, was a literary superstar.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.000]   And what is it?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.360]   Was it the '30s, the '20s?
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.120]   Staring with the '20s and '30s, she sort of
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.760]   came with professional age during one of the great times
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.160]   to be a writer, which was the time when there was nothing
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.720]   but these huge, wonderful literary magazines being started.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.160]   She was on board at the very, very start of The New Yorker
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.560]   and became basically one of the marquee names contributing--
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   She was part of the Algonquin Roundtable
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.800]   of Witch.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   So you get the added advantage of biography like this,
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.360]   where whenever your subject starts to become boring,
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.720]   we'll all start telling stories about how
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.200]   Promarks and Alexander Wilcott and all the other writers
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.960]   who were part of that circle.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.680]   And so there's lots of cool insider stuff
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.200]   about what New York was like back in the '20s and '30s,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.560]   what the creative environment was like.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.240]   And in many ways, how you and I are both very, very concerned
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.200]   about ethical issues and journalism.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.880]   It's sort of weird when you are a theater critic whose friends
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.840]   are all theater critics and you decide to put on a play
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.760]   without quitting your theater critic jobs
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.080]   and all of your theater critic friends
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.800]   that you have lunch with every single day,
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.880]   say, oh, don't worry, we'll give you some good reviews.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.520]   But she had a very, very complicated life.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.000]   She had a lot of men in her life that she--
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.440]   the book sort of makes the--
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.040]   again, this is maybe oversimplification--
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.360]   that it takes sort of like the first year psychology student
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.080]   point of view that, oh, well, see, she
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.800]   didn't have a good relationship with her father.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.880]   And so she's always--
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.040]   she spent her life trying to find a father rep--
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.160]   oh, that's it.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:21.800]   We got it.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.360]   Great.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:22.720]   Ship it.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.640]   We got it.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.400]   But even if you don't buy into that storyline,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.600]   you see lots of the sort of self-destructive behavior
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.240]   that doesn't lead to being dead at 33 or 34 like Keith Moon.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.800]   Unfortunately, it leads to becoming very, very old
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.440]   and still very, very drunk and very, very dependent
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.680]   on a lot of things for continuing survival.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.400]   So fastening person, not only that,
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.280]   but the nucleus of a lot of fascinating stories
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.200]   about other people.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.000]   More than anything else, I just enjoy the fact
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.200]   that it's such an entertaining and readable story.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.600]   And once again, we like to note the gross tonnage.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.680]   For those of you who are getting your one credit's worth,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.960]   your free book's worth, on a bridge, 17 hours, 22 minutes.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.840]   Wow.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.760]   Gross tonnage wins.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.920]   FTW.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.400]   I don't think I should admit.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.080]   You get it for free.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:08.360]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.160]   And you sign up for the goal to catch a first book is free.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   Even if you cancel at any time, you get to keep the book.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.360]   This sounds like a good one.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.480]   Now, I'm a fan of--
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.120]   and I've read all-- you read your ball mow, things like--
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.280]   I think it was-- he ran the gamut of emotions from A to B
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.480]   and things like that.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.360]   And then I read some of her short stories
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.600]   and they did not age well.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.920]   But she was writing in that milieu.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.600]   She went one of her famous quotes
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.760]   is about-- she was known for witticisms,
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.200]   known for really quotable things.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.240]   And she would say that, well, I write mostly doodads
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.080]   because New York is a doodad sort of town.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.440]   And so it is kind of doo daddy.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.560]   But I love the era.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.000]   And she was-- wasn't she in the Bloomsbury group as well
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.800]   in England?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.480]   So she was a literary star.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.440]   Dorothy Parker by Marion Mead, our pick of the week.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.200]   But believe me, you got plenty of choices.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.760]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak and get your free book
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.120]   today.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.960]   And we thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.360]   This is just in a couple of stories.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.320]   And gadgets just pumping them out today.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.760]   There's another Motorola phone Verizon will be shipping,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.960]   according to boy genius report called The Calgary.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.200]   Looks like a low-end droid.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.240]   So I think it must be clear at this point
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.080]   that Verizon's saying--
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.200]   We're not going down that road.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.400]   Screw you, Apple.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.160]   And you wonder whether something happened in the background.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.440]   Something must have, because the CEO of Verizon
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.840]   said six months ago, we will have the iPhone.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   So I think this is a Steve Jobs-like movement.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.720]   Remember what Steve Jobs couldn't get Adobe to sell a premiere?
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.440]   Where would know what Adobe said we're going to stop making
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.520]   premiere for the Mac platform.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.680]   And Steve Jobs said, screw you Adobe and bought Final Cut.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.560]   And that kind of how it happened.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.160]   The story is a little complicated about what--
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160]   More complicated.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.040]   But it's how Steve works, which is sometimes he's motivated.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.240]   It was definitely when Avid said that they're moving off--
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.680]   Yeah, when Avid said they're moving off the platform,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:03.800]   the rumor is that certain people at high up at Apple
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.440]   became somewhat irate and somewhat
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.840]   focused on the absolute destruction of the company.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.640]   I think it's good to be a--
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.560]   You want to win.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:16.600]   You want to win.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.440]   I think that's fine.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.120]   Competitive.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.960]   And then another story just out this moment--
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.600]   Barnes and Noble is launching.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.640]   They have now launched their ebook,
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.800]   their Kindle Killer, their ebook reader.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   And $259, it's called the Nook e-reader,
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.960]   looks pretty much exactly like the Kindle, which
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.640]   is kind of a surprise.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.600]   And I'm trying to pull it up here so that you could see it
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.280]   on the video for those of you watching at home.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.320]   I love seeing all this happening right now.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.600]   I keep on waiting for the tablet.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.800]   But you think that the--
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.320]   You're waiting for the iPhone, though.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.440]   I think that as Alton Brown would say
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.840]   that the problem with the e-books I've decided watching
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.600]   and thinking about it is really that they're unitaskers.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.240]   Unitaskers.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.160]   They're unitaskers.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.720]   And I just-- I'm going to want--
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.880]   You're a multi-tasker.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.160]   I'm not going to carry a unitasker around.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.680]   I cannot get it in the kingdom.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.440]   Oh, well.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.200]   It's an interesting--
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   How about my product?
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.320]   It looks just like the Kindle sized.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.840]   Does have a touch display, does have color.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:26.320]   Built-in Wi-Fi, AT&T 3G, 2 gigabytes of external storage,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.680]   and an S3 microSD slot.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.080]   MP3 player with a built-in mono speaker.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.880]   And a 3 and 1/2 millimeter headphone jack.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.080]   Micro USB port to charge it.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.360]   Supports bookmaking, making notes, highlighting passages.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.640]   And the lend-- I love this.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.160]   The lend me feature allows users to lend books for two weeks
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.280]   at a time to other e-readers, cell phones, or computers.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.520]   That's something really missing, I think,
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   from the book reading experience on the Kindle.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.560]   It's Visplex's e-ink display, which
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.320]   is color and touchscreen.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.720]   Swipe to brows, full color covers.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:05.560]   I'm liking it.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.320]   I don't care if it's a unitasker.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.240]   Is that what you're--
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.160]   It's a unitasker.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.800]   Unitasker.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.400]   Alex, what's your pick of the week?
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.440]   So I have a heretical pick.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.360]   What?
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.240]   And what would that be?
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.520]   What are you picking the mad monk?
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.480]   What are you--
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.400]   What do you--
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.640]   I think actually-- I think it's important that I pick it.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.040]   You know, I think it might have been--
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.400]   This is the Rasputin pick.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.880]   I don't think it was picked by anybody else here,
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.560]   because it would be-- it would have got it.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.280]   I am going to pick the Zoom.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:33.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   Did you steal my Zoom?
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.880]   Because somebody took my Zoom.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.800]   No, I bought one.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.520]   You bought one.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.040]   I bought one.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.960]   I bought it.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:39.840]   No one sent it to me.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.840]   No one, whatever.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.840]   Did you get that Zoom for free?
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.400]   I did not get it for free.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.280]   I bought it.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:45.800]   I got it for free.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.480]   It's pretty good, isn't it?
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.640]   Here's what happened is.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.080]   And the reason that I'm picking it on a Mac show
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.920]   is because--
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.400]   I know you think--
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:54.920]   I really think--
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.640]   You're crazy, is what you're doing.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   I really think--
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.040]   Now, I want to say, I sync it on my Mac.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.640]   I have a Mac.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.480]   How do you do that?
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.320]   I thought it didn't work with it.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.560]   I have Windows on my Mac.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.640]   It requires Windows.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.760]   That requires--
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.200]   You but you like the Zoom pass, don't you?
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:08.960]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.880]   Isn't that great?
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.800]   And this is what Apple is missing, I think.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.680]   And I think this is going to be a big deal.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.760]   I think this is going to be growing,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.920]   because I think more people are starting
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.640]   to see what that offers.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.760]   Is that I bought a Zoom.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.520]   I put 3,000 songs on it that night.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.280]   And I didn't feel--
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.680]   And I know a lot of people listening have put 3,000 songs on,
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.520]   but I put it on without having any guilt.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.520]   It's guilt-free.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.680]   And so the thing is is that in whatever I felt like getting,
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.280]   I just started downloading it.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.280]   And I'm not carrying it around all the time,
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.840]   but what I bought it for specifically
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.480]   is my little travel one that's going to hold all my--
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.320]   just the songs that I constantly am changing.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.360]   I'm constantly--
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.040]   I'm in a different-- I feel like something different.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.960]   And I have a lot of songs already on my iPhone.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.680]   I have a lot of songs on other things.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:06.040]   But I think that I strongly believe
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.080]   if Apple was able to do a subscription service,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.000]   it wouldn't leave-- and this is maybe why they don't do it--
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.600]   that combined with what they're already offering,
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.880]   it would leave only stubble left in the market.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.200]   I mean, I think that this is the one big chink in Apple's armor.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.160]   So why don't they do it?
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.560]   I mean, it's not like they don't want to win.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.960]   The only reason that I could think of is,
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.520]   hey, the record companies don't let them.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.280]   It started off, I think, when Steve didn't think it was
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.240]   a good idea.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.440]   But I think it went to the record companies.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.080]   I don't know if they're offering it to them
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.560]   because it wouldn't remove that.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.320]   And the last thing is, is if you destroyed all of their
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.600]   competition, they'd be in the same place that Microsoft is.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.080]   You know, because they just--
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.320]   They can't afford to be a complete nutter monopoly.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.920]   And maybe I'm being a little too much--
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.480]   It's interesting.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.320]   --conspiracy theorist in this.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.200]   But I am with you.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.400]   In fact, Andy, you have one too.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:54.760]   Don't you?
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.240]   You have a Zoom HD, don't you?
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.320]   Yeah, I had one on loan for a while.
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:58.960]   And I loved it.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.320]   I gave it a very positive review.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.680]   Not just for the fact that a subscription-based model is
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.080]   such a powerful thing once you start playing with it.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.520]   But also, it's a very, very nicely designed interface.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.240]   I made my little list of features that I really
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.760]   would like to see Apple steal for a future iPhone.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.320]   The interface is still drilling down through menus.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.160]   But does it through a series of camera moves
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.680]   that make you feel as though you're literally floating
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.280]   through deeper, deeper, deeper?
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.200]   You can still see the fringes of the place we just came from.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.640]   So instead of having an actual labeled back button,
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.440]   you still see the bottom edge of the thing
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.560]   that you tap in order to get here.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.200]   So if you reach up there and tap that again,
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.840]   it'll just bring you right back again.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.880]   But what I love is the top menu has a little sidebar.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.800]   And you can pin things into that sidebar.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.000]   So if there's an audiobook that--
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.880]   Every time I use my iPhone for the media player application,
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.600]   there are three things that I'm always using.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.280]   One playlist that always has my precious podcast in it,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.200]   the audiobook that I'm currently working on,
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.040]   and just a very, very loose playlist that's pippy numbers.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   And so instead of having to drill down through the menu system
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.960]   to get at those things, I could just simply pin them
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.960]   to the top menu and just simply tap on the icon.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.560]   That's a very nice feature.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.680]   I just say that the Zoom application,
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.800]   the chink in the armor for Microsoft--
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.240]   What do you think?
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.600]   Because a lot of people complain about iTunes.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.360]   You don't think it's as good as iTunes?
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.520]   I don't think it's as good as iTunes.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.160]   I don't think it's as fluid as iTunes to build like playlists
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.080]   and everything else I find.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.600]   I'm with you.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.720]   I found it to be a little heavy.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.120]   I'm with you, but I'm thinking that's
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.280]   because I'm used to iTunes.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.040]   Because a lot of Windows users who've never used or don't like
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.840]   iTunes love the Zoom interference.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840]   I think it's a little bit different.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   Which are about the software on the computer.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.520]   The software on the computer I found that it was a little--
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   I thought that it looked pretty.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.000]   Oh, I find it opaque.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.840]   I can't figure out how to do stuff.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.720]   I just found it a little slower to get stuff.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.560]   Now, it also may be that Windows 7 and my touchpad
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.520]   do not get along at all.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.640]   And so I've been banging my head on the wall,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.440]   trying to get it to just go to where I want it to go.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.400]   But the--
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:57.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.080]   You're not using a mouse.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.040]   Well, I am now because I finally gave up.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.440]   But that was just yesterday.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.160]   But as I said, I really think that--
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.080]   The killer app is the Zoom Pass, I think.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.000]   I think the Zoom Pass--
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.240]   It's a bit torn without the guilt.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.400]   I mean, it really is.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.320]   It's just this really--
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.400]   I was twittering that last yesterday.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.240]   But it's just--
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:19.600]   You know what's funny?
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.400]   I ended up buying, though.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.320]   So Warren Zeevan.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.520]   Remember, I think it was you, Andy.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.400]   And so I went on the Zoom Pass and I got all the Warren Zeevan
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:31.680]   albums.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.120]   But I ended up buying some of them
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.920]   to put on my iTunes and iPhone.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.160]   I'm screwed both ways.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.080]   The record company should really love this.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:39.640]   Yeah, we're--
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.440]   We're going to go through it.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.160]   Double dipping.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.720]   And I think that the thing is is that what I love about--
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.480]   what I love about it is is that I just
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.480]   have a remote interest in some band.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   People that were talking--
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.080]   because when I was thinking one day about--
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.240]   I was listening to the police and I was thinking,
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.520]   if I was caught on a desert island, I only had one band.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.920]   I just listened to the police all the time.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.160]   It's pretty good.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.800]   And do you include Sting in that, though?
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.360]   Could you take it?
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.280]   Yeah, I do include Sting.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:01.800]   OK.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.960]   So I'd have to do that.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.400]   Whisting.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.240]   That's a lot of albums.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.800]   And it's a lot of good music.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.760]   And the--
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.880]   but anyway, what I--
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.240]   so I asked-- I was twittered.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.160]   What would you-- if you only had one band to listen to.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.280]   And so all this stuff about modest mouse came up, which I'm
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.640]   not really that familiar with.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.280]   I'm not that familiar with modest mouse, but you know what
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:19.480]   I did?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.280]   I went up to the Zoom pass and I downloaded a whole bunch
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.880]   of modest mouse.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.520]   It's a great way to discover a little bit.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.200]   And I don't have to buy it.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.520]   I don't have to think about it.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.280]   I don't have to--
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.680]   I can just download all their albums.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.320]   I think that's the point of it, though.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.600]   It's not for somebody who wants to keep the music.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.080]   It's for a person who wants to discover the music.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.280]   And you may end up buying stuff.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.640]   Exactly.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.160]   Because as soon as you stop paying the $15 a month,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:39.600]   you lose it.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.360]   And like when you get to--
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.080]   But I love this idea of being able to experiment and listen
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.800]   to albums and get to know them as album--
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.440]   album form without feeling like I threw a lot of money away.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.840]   Anyway, that's--
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.360]   Yeah, you're going to get in a lot of heat for that.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.280]   I like "Slingsy."
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.640]   This has been a kind of a pro-Microsoft.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.880]   You might guys might want to come to my Windows house
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.760]   party on Thursday for the launch of Windows 7.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.120]   And that would be--
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:05.760]   Just come on in.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.200]   Well, everyone at Windows Weekly, they complain that we
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.720]   talk too much about the Mac.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.680]   So you know--
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.160]   Well, yeah.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.920]   But Paul is not a Mac fan in the way that apparently we
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.800]   have become Windows fans, so I don't know.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.440]   We don't have to start a new show.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.200]   I think that it's--
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.920]   I just think that it's important for Apple to be
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.960]   constantly looking at all the other things that are really,
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.240]   really, really cool.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.320]   I love my Mac.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:26.840]   I did call.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840]   I didn't even--
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840]   I don't want to--
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.840]   I don't want to--
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.840]   --nefistophiles.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   Is the devil.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.840]   Is the devil.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.080]   No, I think that we are pro-user.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.800]   And we're not pro any company.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.960]   And I don't think we should be--
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.640]   I don't think we should be fanboys.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.760]   I think we should be pro-user.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.360]   And it's great to have the competition.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.160]   Andy, what's your pick of the week, sir?
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.400]   Well, I've been doing a lot more explorations
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.920]   into digital comics lately, which
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   means that I've been downloading a lot more comics digitally
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.240]   than I used to, i.e., I am now downloading digital comics
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.640]   instead of not downloading them.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.000]   And so I wanted to have to go through three or four different
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.440]   comic book reader apps for the desktop.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.640]   And I finally came--
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.840]   I finally wound up agreeing with my close personal friend
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.120]   and close personal editor Jason Stell over at Mac World
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.520]   who pointed me towards comicbook lover by bitcartell.com.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.560]   There are two popular file formats
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.120]   for comic book CBR and CBZ.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.560]   Essentially, it's just a compressed archive file
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.600]   that has a stack full of numbered JPEGs, each one
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.280]   for each page of the comic.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.320]   And it truly--
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.840]   Comic Book Lover truly is the iTunes of comic book reader apps.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.080]   When you get these CBR files, you just drag them
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.200]   into the application.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.960]   It imports them into a library, organizes them by title and issue,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.840]   and gives you all the tools that you really
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.560]   want for reading this stuff on your screen.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.640]   And when you read this, read comics on your MacBook.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.920]   I find it even a superior experience
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.720]   to actually holding the real MacBook.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.160]   Really?
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.920]   Because the app lets you turn the MacBook on its side
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.520]   and treat its screen almost like a tablet screen.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.600]   So it will dispense with the entire user interface
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.040]   and fill the entire screen with this extremely high resolution
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.280]   image of the page.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.560]   But you can then move from page to page.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.280]   Can you zoom in and see more detail if you want?
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.400]   If you like, there's a magnifier.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.960]   There are automated page turning tools.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.480]   If you have one of them big 48-inch new iMac screens,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.240]   you can even have two page spreads left and right pages
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.280]   on the screen at the same time.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.240]   It's rarely a case where I find myself thinking
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.840]   I'm missing something by reading this digit--
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.760]   looking at this page digitally instead of holding it
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.600]   in my Apple hand.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.200]   Do you smell of the ink, the feel of the pulp?
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.480]   I miss the smell of the other people at the comic book shop.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.160]   No, no, that's just a nasty--
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.760]   Just a jerry type.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.880]   There was only-- I do still go to my regular comic shop
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.840]   every single week.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   The Outer Limits in Waltham, Massachusetts, Moody Street,
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.960]   Ask for Steve, tell him I sent you.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.280]   And there's only one stinky guy that I've ever really
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:01.840]   encountered there.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.120]   And that was on Free Comic Book Day,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.400]   when there's lots of outsiders.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.840]   And that's the--
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.600]   But I think this is going to become a bigger and bigger
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.680]   market.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.760]   I'm working on a piece for the Sun Times right now
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.840]   that I'm hoping to have online today or tomorrow that
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.040]   includes a piece of news about digital--
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.720]   or, excuse me, a piece of speculation backed
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.320]   by a couple of interviews on digital comics distribution.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.040]   I think it's going to become a lot bigger in 2010.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.240]   Right now--
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.480]   It makes me want to read comics, because if I can download them
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.520]   and read them, I think that's convenient.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.960]   Particularly because if you're curious about--
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.680]   if you see a documentary about the band
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.760]   and you want to download one of their albums,
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.280]   OK, that's kind of interesting.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.520]   With comic books, so much of what makes sense today
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.960]   requires that you know what happened five years ago,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.800]   or 10 years ago, or 20 years ago.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.120]   You need to see, well, how did these characters get together
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.960]   and why does this character get pissed off
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.200]   about this other character over the year?
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.320]   Do they-- are most comic books now available online?
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.440]   I mean, is that--
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.840]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.480]   There's only one company, major company,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.800]   that's doing real work in digital comics,
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.840]   and that's Marvel Comics.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.000]   And they do an initiative called Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.480]   But it is, in fact, quite limited.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.640]   They have about 7,000 titles in their online library.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.280]   But you can't simply say, oh, I heard
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.520]   that Deadpool 900 last week was pretty interesting.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.960]   I'll just get that digitally.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.880]   Well, no, it's only going to become available
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.200]   when it's two or three months old.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.680]   Or in five years when there's a new storyline that
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.720]   references back to it.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.960]   And you may want to buy your comics anyway,
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.000]   because for collectability--
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.320]   this way you can put them in the plastic
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.440]   and read it on the computer.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.080]   Again, there is no bigger comic book nerd than me.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.880]   Or maybe there is.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.080]   And by virtue of the fact, I find that hardly believe.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.560]   I stopped even I stopped bagging and boarding these comics
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.480]   a long time ago, because I realized that I don't read these.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.560]   I don't-- they're almost only like maybe one half of 1%
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.480]   turn out to be really valuable in the future.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.440]   Why am I wasting time in storing them?
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.760]   But the thing is, the comic--
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.320]   the comic industry hasn't-- has yet to come--
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.200]   excuse me-- they've yet to have its iTunes moment,
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.440]   where remember that every single music publisher
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.040]   tried to do their own thing with publishing comics--
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.680]   excuse me, publishing music digitally.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.680]   They failed miserably because they weren't in tune
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   with how people really experienced music digitally.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.440]   Also, people want to have one store they go to to find
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.360]   everything they could possibly want to buy.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.840]   So finally, they went to Apple, hat and hand, and said, OK,
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.640]   you were right.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.920]   Let's sign up for the iTunes store.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.880]   Let's make this a success.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.880]   So there's comics on the iTunes-- oh, no.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.520]   You're talking about music?
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.880]   Well, there are some comics in the iTunes store
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.240]   in the form of apps you can buy for the iPhone.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.200]   And there's iverse.com also has an iPhone app
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   and a desktop app.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   But it has the same problems that the music industry had
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.720]   in 2001, 2002.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.080]   It only has a handful of comics that you may or may not
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.080]   be interested in.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.160]   And once again, if there's a comic that you have heard of
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.760]   that you want to check out, chances
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.080]   are extremely slim that you will find it online.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.920]   Is there a standard format?
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.480]   Yeah, CBR and CBZ is the file extension.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.840]   It's a very simple format.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.760]   It's just a compressed archive that
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.720]   has a stack of JPEGs that are numbered in page sequence.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.400]   Now, a lot of independent publishers
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.000]   are releasing their comics in those two formats and as PDFs,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.960]   either for promotional reasons or just to build an audience.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.040]   It's also being used for piracy.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.640]   And here's another analog to the early days of digital music.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.440]   In the absence of a good solution to buy comics legally
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.320]   online, now it's certainly possible to get just about every
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.200]   comic that was published last week as a download from somewhere.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.920]   There are only two blogs that if I wanted to find something,
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.160]   I could hit one of these two blogs, I would find a link.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   It's inevitable.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:38.960]   Number 900.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.000]   So they have to address that.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.040]   They've got to offer these online.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.160]   It's going to be--
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.080]   The bus is pulling away.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   And if they want to start making money digitally, they're
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.040]   going to have to cut a deal with whoever they have cut it.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.560]   Is there a site that you recommend for at least what's
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.040]   out there now?
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.520]   There is-- I'll have to email you a link.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.800]   There's actually a really good link to--
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.280]   a guy maintains a page of just links to free comics available
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.520]   online.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.400]   There's going to be--
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.040]   Is that Lauren Collins?
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.120]   The Collins Compendium of free online comic books?
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.040]   That could possibly be a gift.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.440]   It sure looks like it.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:09.960]   Very good.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.600]   So you get watch for number one.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.040]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.320]   Oh, this is really neat.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.800]   All legal and legitimate.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.280]   There's a whole chapter in the new version of the iPhone book
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.360]   just dedicated to reading comics on the iPhone.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.240]   So I really had to steep myself in that experience.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.000]   There's a company called Longbox.com, though,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.560]   that wants to become the iTunes store of comics.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.400]   And hopefully, they'll have some success
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.920]   in tying all these companies together.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.200]   I do feel as though these companies have started
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.960]   to have that experience where they realize that we--
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.760]   I use this phrase a lot because I love it so much.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.640]   We are a society in chaos and capable of self-rule.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.120]   Another company is going to annex us
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.960]   and impose a colonial governor.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.560]   And I think that Longbox Inc.com might be that people who
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.840]   come in and say, let us republish your comics.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.320]   Let us take over for you.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.880]   We will give you an iTunes store that
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.320]   will let you make money and prevent piracy.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.200]   You can't do this.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.280]   You're very bad at it.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.480]   I hope I can help somebody does this.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.720]   So I mean, I comic book lover really
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.920]   just show you what is possible with this format.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.720]   You do need to have some sort of a device that
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.280]   has a nice big color screen in order to make it work.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.600]   This is obviously going to become a lot more relevant
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.960]   in the coming months when--
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.120]   That more than one mobile device might be a good device.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.000]   Well, maybe not.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.360]   As far as I understand, it's a hybrid screen
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.040]   where it has color elements for the interface.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.960]   But the actual page is still e-ing.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.400]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.160]   But even my Kindle DX, if you simply convert them,
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.320]   it has a 16 grayscale reader.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.560]   And comics are eminently readable on a black and white display.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.080]   Obviously, really well if they started off
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.440]   as black and white comics.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.120]   But the idea of carrying 40, 50, 60, 70 issues of a comic
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.880]   on a small tablet-sized device.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.320]   And being able to read an entire graphic novel just digitally,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.720]   it helps to sell this idea than the importance
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.360]   of moving this format into digital.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.440]   Well, I look forward to it.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.880]   So the software, again, it's $25.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.200]   It's from Cartel, B-I-T-C-I-R-T-E-L.com,
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.560]   bitcartel.com, comic book lover Andy's pick of the week.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.480]   Now mine is an iPhone app, see?
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.120]   You guys, you guys, this is perfect.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.520]   It's like we planned it.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.440]   But this one is blowing my freaking mind.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.880]   It is basically iMovie for the iPhone.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.760]   It's called, yeah, it's got transitions, it's got titles.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.960]   It allows you to combine clips, edit clips,
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.400]   all within the iPhone, 799.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.880]   It's called Real Director, R-E-E-L,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.000]   came out five days ago.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.960]   And I wish I remember where I saw it.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.840]   But it's really pretty sweet.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.600]   You create projects just as you would on the iPhone.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.280]   You have a timeline.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.400]   I mean, on the iMovie, I should say.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.920]   You have a timeline.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:08.040]   You render it, so you kind of do stuff pre-rendering.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.640]   You've got titles.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.200]   I mean, it's just a really sweet little editor.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.240]   Can you post the iPhoto?
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.920]   I mean, YouTube?
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.040]   Well, you know, what happens is it saves it back out.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.760]   Let's see what the share button does here.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.840]   Video too long to send.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.520]   Yeah, so they're using the built-in iMail feature.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.360]   So what I would do is I would save it out.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.800]   This is what I did, for instance,
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.800]   and put it up on--
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.400]   I use pick posters to put on my PostRIS page.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.680]   So you render it out, you save it.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.640]   And then it's a video within your phone
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.920]   just like in your library.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.360]   So it's in your camera roll.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.000]   I think this is just really a sweet little.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.720]   What they need to do is do like a $5,000 prize
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.240]   for the best movie shot in an edit.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.320]   Now, it's simple.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.720]   There are only a few transitions.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.400]   There's a cross dissolve, fade through black,
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.600]   fade through white, flash through black, flash through white.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.800]   All you need is cross dissolve.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.400]   Blurfade, blur cross, white bled, white, white, top.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.680]   There's more than you need.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.520]   Let's put it that way.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.000]   Cross dissolve and cut.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.160]   Couple of things I didn't like,
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.680]   but I'm sure that version 1.1 will have it.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.120]   There doesn't seem to be anywhere
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.560]   that I could set how long the titles are on.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.680]   You could put opening credits in,
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.920]   but they seem to come and go pretty quickly.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.960]   You have positioning.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960]   You do have some styling in the credits.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.880]   So--
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.720]   This is an amazing little app.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.920]   Considering it's 7.99 and it's on the iPhone,
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.560]   what I found is that the trim is not quite enough for me.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.640]   I shoot a lot of iPhone movies.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.680]   And what I'd love to do is be able to dissolve
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.760]   from one clip to another clip.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.600]   And this will let you do it.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.640]   And I wouldn't say it's for titling and for other stuff,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.000]   maybe it gives you some capability.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:43.960]   What is this version 1?
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.440]   This is version 1.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.280]   It's called--
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.120]   Who's got a Santa Malondre list?
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.800]   No, it's pretty impressive.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800]   This is called Real Directors from Next Vio.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.000]   And it is 7.99.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.200]   Which is a little expensive for an iPhone app, but--
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.240]   You hear that clicking?
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.640]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.480]   I'm buying it.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.960]   I've been very happy with it.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.560]   Scrollable, seekable timeline.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.000]   You've got full preview of a frame
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.760]   at a current timeline position with watermarks
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.880]   and transitions applied.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.440]   So it's kind of pre-rendering.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.240]   There are multi-line opens and closing credits.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.280]   Four title positions, styles rather, nine positions.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.880]   Gradually fade title and opening credits in and out.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.320]   You know, it's a pretty impressive little thing.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   It just came out.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.880]   And I've been very happy with it.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.200]   They do have an online tutorial.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   It is 7.99.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.360]   It's called Real Director.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.320]   That's my pick of the--
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.680]   That's a great one.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.320]   Well, I wish I could remember.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.640]   I saw it on, I think, Friend Feed.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.920]   And I wish I could remember it, because I would
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.720]   love to give the person--
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.400]   It was only released like five days ago.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.360]   The internet nervous system, my friend, is moving.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.840]   I think you're nervous, just faster than my nervous.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.080]   I sit there and I watch--
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.280]   I've moved back to Twitter since they started that lists thing.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.120]   I just feel like Twitter, Friend Feed kind of died on the vine.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.120]   And Twitter has taken the--
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.000]   it's back.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.160]   And there's just nothing to compete with it.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.200]   So I'm spending a lot more time on Twitter than I did.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.680]   And that, to me, is the internet nervous system.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.640]   That's where I find out about stuff.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.520]   And you follow the right people you find out a lot of stuff.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.160]   3GS only, I believe, yes.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.920]   But go try it and see.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.880]   It says for the 3GS, so I suspect that's the case.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.280]   And you need a lot of horsepower.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280]   Let me just see if it's--
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.520]   you have video editing for the iPhone 3GS.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.440]   Requirements.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.400]   Yep.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.000]   And you have to have OS 3.0 word later.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.120]   You need the horsepower of the 3GS to do that.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.720]   Alex Lindsey is at the Luscious Pixel Core at pixelcore.tv
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.160]   for the podcast, pixelcore.com.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.800]   If you want to find out about this great guild
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.400]   of multimedia artists, anything to tell us about?
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.120]   We are going to try to stream some stuff tomorrow.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.200]   So we're going to be shooting on a big green screen
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:56.700]   stage.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.200]   It's actually the old ILM stages.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:58.720]   Wow.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.520]   And so we are--
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.240]   I can't guarantee it, but it would make--
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.640]   it would be good to--
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.000]   this isn't just a blatant thing for people to follow me.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.160]   Follow me.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.640]   I'll Twitter it if we're following.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.120]   So I mean, if we're streaming.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.480]   So it'll be just Alex Lindsey is the Twitter.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.760]   This is my example.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.800]   You need some internet nervous systems.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.680]   So what am I doing?
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.320]   If you're following me, you'll get a Twitter--
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.280]   I'll probably Twitter about shooting no matter what.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.920]   But if we can get the stream working--
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.760]   That would be cool from the watch.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.320]   You know, we're just going to put a stream up there
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.040]   and let people just watch it somewhere else.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.400]   Where is that stage?
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.000]   Is it in Skywalker?
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:34.500]   No.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.000]   No, it's in Santa Felettes.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.480]   It's an industrial--
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.040]   industrial park.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:41.520]   Oh.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.480]   So there's a big stage there.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.800]   And I was setting up this morning.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.800]   I'm going to go back there right after we finish the show.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.320]   And so anyway, so check that out.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.800]   As I said, I will Twitter it tomorrow if we get the stream up.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.880]   It might not be up the whole time,
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.000]   but it'll probably be up for an hour or two at least.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.000]   So if we tune in, how much time are we
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.080]   going to be seeing just random people in the crew and yourself
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.720]   doing little 10 second snippets that are going
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.000]   to be your video Christmas cards?
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:05.400]   Well, there.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.960]   I'm still killing myself.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.320]   I spent that time in your office in June.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:11.840]   So fun.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.520]   And you had the green screen sets.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.440]   So fun.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.520]   I had the 3G.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.720]   I had some sort of little digital video camcorder.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.000]   I could just hand it to somebody and just shot
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.120]   just like 10 seconds of, wow, it sure is cold here in--
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.360]   That would be fun when it--
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.520]   That would be fun.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.000]   Yeah, this one should be pretty fun to watch,
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.760]   because it's-- for some of the stuff,
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.080]   we've got a big motion control camera.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.600]   So that's a big remote arm that's going to be swinging around.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.720]   And then we've got, you know, jibs and dollies.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.880]   And it's a big shoot.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.440]   So you don't get to see these very often.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.760]   And we're just trying to go through making sure
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   that everybody's OK with it.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760]   And then also that's involved.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.800]   And then also making sure the stream's going to work.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.000]   They have plenty good connection there.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.680]   So just a matter of getting it all sorted out.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.480]   Twitter.com/AlexLindsay.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.360]   I like your background.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.160]   That nice canvas.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.000]   It's very tasteful.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.960]   I made it.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.600]   It's very tasteful.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.440]   Notice, by the way, I don't know if you have lists yet.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.080]   But you are on my Geeks list and my Twitch list.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.480]   I haven't turned that on yet.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.520]   You know, well, the Twitter has to turn it on for you.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.120]   But you are on 33 other people's lists.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.480]   Wow.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.800]   Photojunkies, people I've met.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.640]   Tech Geeks, that kind of thing.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.440]   Wow.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.360]   This is the new number.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.720]   It's not the followers number.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.240]   It's the list.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.160]   How many lists you're on?
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.000]   That's the one.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Let's see how many--
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.520]   What is this?
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:25.520]   Alex.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.480]   I mean, Andy, you're not co-is that?
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.960]   What are you and not co-or Andy and not co-or?
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.360]   I don't understand what are you on Twitter.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.080]   I am simply an not co.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.520]   I have no idea how to spell that.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.680]   Hold on.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.240]   I built one list that I haven't really populated yet
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.800]   because I haven't figured out what to do with this feature yet.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.240]   So--
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.600]   I think that the strength of it is curated lists
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.720]   mean that users who are new to Twitter
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.160]   or who don't know who to follow can go to somebody they like.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.880]   Well, see, my problem is that I had--
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.480]   I created and rejected three or four different lists
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.520]   because I'm like, OK, how about Andy's friends?
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.800]   No, because the first time you forget to add something
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.120]   to that list, that's a very tense conversation.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.920]   Or how about your favorite Twitter
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.560]   who's like, no, again, if you have friends that you have
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   to explain, how come--
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.320]   How come I didn't--
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.160]   Well, you see?
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   I don't appear in your head.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.000]   I noticed that you're not on my geeks list.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.800]   But that was just-- that was in an error.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.920]   You are on the twist list, but see, it's very easy.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.760]   Look how all the lists I have.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.920]   Foodies, science, politicians, tech TV, petaluma, tech,
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.960]   photographers, feeds.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.840]   You created these lists?
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:29.840]   These are my lists.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.640]   Organizations, funny software, celebs, journalists.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.440]   I mean, I want to add to them, but it's--
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:34.960]   and you know what?
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.760]   You see how slow the interface is?
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.880]   I just checked geeks and it's taking forever to--
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.400]   Well, it's the computer.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:39.920]   It's painful.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.240]   It's not the computer.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:41.840]   It's Twitter.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.720]   It's very painful.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.520]   The Twitter databases are so--
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.680]   They're making you earn it.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.520]   They're making you earn it.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:47.960]   See that?
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.640]   You start making lists all over the place if it was easy.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.080]   Well, I did.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.120]   I made 20 lists.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.520]   That's your maximum.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.400]   But most people just make one.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.960]   Or maybe two.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.760]   I notice yours is called Twit Love.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.240]   Is that Twitter Love or is that Twits?
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.640]   That's-- again, that was my fourth cut.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.600]   Well, what if I just simply say it's Twit Love?
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.480]   Does Twitter followers that I love for whatever reason
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.560]   possible?
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.200]   And once again--
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.400]   And it doesn't have to be people you follow.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.960]   There's nobody in it.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.040]   You see, Leo, I'm just so sensitive to the thoughts
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.800]   and feelings of other people.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.680]   I don't want to be that one thing that causes someone
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680]   to self-doubt.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.680]   And Twitter now, I'm getting a Twitter is over capacity now.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.200]   We broke Twitter.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.760]   You know, Twitter is pretty fragile.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.120]   It's fairly easy to break it.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.560]   In fact, just mentioning it on a live podcast, apparently,
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.440]   is an almost over the edge.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.720]   I've been acting sort of as--
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.640]   sort of as like the guide to a friend of mine who just
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.120]   got into Twitter recently after really just rejecting it
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.640]   and just disposing for months and months and months.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.600]   And he said, I'm just going to do it for 30 days.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.760]   Just as experiments just to test it out.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.440]   And now it's 11 days later.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.240]   And Sunday morning, when it was impossible to get on to Twitter,
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.680]   I got two emails from him saying, is Twitter down?
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680]   You can't--
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.440]   I think it's like that friend of yours who keeps saying,
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.800]   that's all right.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.840]   I just have this bottle of pills, this bottle of wine.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.560]   You won't be hearing from me anymore.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.600]   I think it does that.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.760]   Just to make sure you still love it.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.360]   I'll hit-- why don't I just hit refresh four or five times
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.520]   so you know how much I need you in my live Twitter?
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.400]   Anyway, I think the list thing is something kind of interesting
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   that they've done.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.200]   It's a big shift.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.080]   You're looking to use it.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.760]   Yeah, it really changes how people use it.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.960]   You see all these lists.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.760]   But not everybody has it.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.160]   So if you don't have it yet.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.600]   But see, I'm on 208 lists.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.760]   But Scobles on--
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.400]   I'm competing with Scoble again.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.240]   It's back to the way it used to be.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.120]   It's even again.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.960]   Let's see.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.080]   I just had a curiosity.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.800]   Well, I guess you have to earn it to get on these lists.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.240]   Yeah, see?
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:23:59.680]   You can't.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.560]   It's just not--
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.040]   For the moment.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.840]   For the moment.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.680]   Let's just see.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.000]   Barrocks on 233.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.680]   You're close.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.160]   I'm close.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.840]   I'm going back to neck.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.240]   There you go.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.120]   See, it's back to the way it used to be.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.320]   Back when Twitter was just for geeks.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for joining us.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.040]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.120]   And his website is the Caleschial.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:22.960]   I did it with a hard say.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   I don't know why.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.160]   Caleschial, waste of bandwidth.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.560]   C-W-O-B.com.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.120]   And his Twitter handle is I-H-N-A-T-K.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.080]   Oh.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.680]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.800]   I'm Leo Leport.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.560]   Don't forget, we did make that announcement on Friday
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.920]   that we are starting to offer video.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.240]   There will be video of this show on iTunes, on the Zoom store,
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.720]   and in fact, on your Roku, your Palmpre, your iPhone,
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.480]   and all of that.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.280]   That's coming soon.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.520]   Not-- we're ready.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.720]   We're ready.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.200]   So what you're saying is that I've got only a couple weeks
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   to finish my backdrop.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.480]   Yes, get going.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.400]   Or clean my office.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.160]   I think I'll finish the direct backdrop first.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.400]   Back when I'll clean my office.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.680]   For the last few weeks, we've been editing all the shows
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.080]   in Final Cut.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.640]   So we do audio and video.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.600]   So we do have video of shows.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.120]   And we are going to-- we have to modify--
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.040]   we'll do a temporary modify modification to twit.tv
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.240]   so you can watch or download video as well as audio.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.280]   We will be doing a single feed temporarily to iTunes.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.440]   Our partner Mediafly is going to do some transcoding
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.560]   that will allow you to watch on any platform.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.960]   But until that happens, we're going
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.720]   to make kind of a middling quality hinted H.264 baseline
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.360]   that you should be able to play on almost any device.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.040]   And that will be-- we'll let you know that'll be on--
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.160]   that feed will that for that will be up pretty soon.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.280]   But meanwhile, you can listen to the audio any time you want.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.440]   Or watch us do this thing live-- 2 p.m., Eastern 11 a.m.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.560]   Pacific every single Tuesday at live.twit.tv.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.880]   Some say it's live.twit.tv.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.120]   Live your choice.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   Your choice.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.280]   Live, please.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.040]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.960]   From your computers, go to the windows.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.600]   First, you've just got to get mad.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.160]   I'm mad as hell.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.200]   And I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:08.840]   Go back to work.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.000]   Break time is over.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.440]   (upbeat music)
