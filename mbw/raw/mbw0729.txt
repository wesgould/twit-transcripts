[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, latest news from Apple coming across the wire.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Thank goodness we've got our analysts ready.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   They're lead pencils poised on the horn here.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's Lori Gill, she's managing editor at imore.com.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Where of course, of course she uses, do you use a red pencil or a blue pencil?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   She uses a pen.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Black?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Stylus.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Ooh.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Ink.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Ink means you can't take it back.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You know what?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I'm that sure of myself.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   You do cross your puzzles in Ink 2.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And you're brave.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Andy Naco also here from WGB, B-H in Boston.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They're not go here from historic Bath Bay, Maine,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   site of the famous submarine races.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I know that.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's those guys.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Bob and Ray.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Bob and Ray.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yay.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I finally --
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That was your Wally Bulu impression.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, I got my tape player working so I can finally play my Bob and Ray tape.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   What is that?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's a Sony tape player.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Did you get a new one or is that from the MIT flea market?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   This is a new to me one.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   This is the -- I finally gave up and be able to afford the really great --
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's a good one.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   -- like a tank, DCM 5, the $600.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   This is the TC142, which is sort of like the mono version of it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And actually I've been sort of collecting because even the broken ones of the TC2
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and the TCD5 costs like $400.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Again, broken.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Nobody wants these, so these are literally the cost of like a large pizza.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, it's the radio recorder, though, because you can carry it over your shoulder.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You don't need to track.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You only got one mic.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Perfect, exactly.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Perfect.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But they're really not -- I'm kind of embarrassing myself because even just today --
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I've been working my way backwards because I have the version of it that was like the
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   sister to that stereo deck.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I have the version that came before it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And today on a maiden bid of $9.99, I bought like the first version in the series,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   which is actually stereo and the 1978 version.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But what I'm getting at is that I get to listen to my Bob and Rake tapes again,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   which is really all that little about.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You know, you could digitize them and then you could listen at any time.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Now I can because --
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They make those too.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah, that's how much I love Bob and Rake.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Even when I was packing up my entire house and throwing away three quarters of my stuff,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I had these four cassette sets and I'm like, I have nothing that can play these,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and yet I cannot part with these.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Someday we will be reunited and I will bring you hand in hand into the land of digital.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And now I can finally do that thing.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It is partly to the X-Pree 3.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It is probably the case that 90% of the audience has no idea what you're talking about.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But the good news is it is available on YouTube Music.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm standing by in Napoleon, Ohio with a report.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Come in please.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Lillie Boulou.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Lillie Boulou here in Napoleon, Ohio.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So that's a live performance.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Wally Boulou at the Paperclip Factory also.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   That's from the very best of Bob and Rake volume one.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm amazed.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Slow talkers of America, which I would play, but we only have two hours for the show.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Exactly.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I will say that it is.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I absolutely acknowledge that if someone tries and said I absolutely didn't get it, I absolutely appreciate that.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It is a sort of comedy where either it is the funniest damn thing you've ever heard in your entire life,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   or you just, it's just your radar is not tuned to that frequency.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But it is definitely tuned to my frequency as...
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's really comedy from the 50s and 60s.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So that's, it doesn't age well, I think.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Well, no, well, I would disagree because it's not like it's topical, but a lot of the stuff they started off as a team in the late 40s,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and they didn't break up until Ray Goulding died in like early 1980s.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   He's actually the Bob Elliott as the father of Chris Elliott from the Letterman Show.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And a lot of the stuff you will have to understand, there used to be this concept on radio
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   called a soap opera.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And so then, but, but when you hear, and that was time for another episode of Matt Nef or Boy Spot Welding King.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's like, okay, I'm here for that.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I'm with you.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I don't know what it's my sense of humor too.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I love it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But Andy, I think we're getting old.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I'm really so, I'm already there.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But one of the great things about getting old is that you absolutely stop giving a damn about what anybody thinks about your team name.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I also have to say that I think some of the comedians of this generation have not aged well.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Who is the college comic that everybody loved about five years ago?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I can't even remember his name anymore.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And he was Dane Cook.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He was huge.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And he wasn't funny.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He wasn't funny.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And whatever happened to him, he's not, you're not going to be, we're not going to hear a podcast 20 years from now,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   or somebody like Andy's going to say, I got the Dane Cook cassettes.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I can't wait to play them again.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Mr. Renee Richie is also here.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Hello Renee of youtube.com/ReneeRitchieFame.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Hello Leo LaPorte.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I'm coming to you live from across the 49th parallel.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   The latest Apple News from the North.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Now you have...
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   That's a great voice.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   He's good.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Go to our international correspondent.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You have a little something, something there.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Do you want to show us what you got?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So Renee is a YouTuber.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And when you get to a certain status on YouTube, they reward you with a black box.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yes.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Inside.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Oh, it's framed.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   It's framed.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   That's a good sign.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Oh no.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   That's...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   A letter from Susan.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Oh, Susan.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What just...
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   He's the CEO.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   She says, "Congratulations on your achievement.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   He's got the silver button, boys and girls.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And then a card from the person who personally went together and packaged this all up for us."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Rick.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So Rick, that means what?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   100,000 subs?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Congratulations.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Congratulations.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   That's a big deal to it.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Renee might not be too humble to say this, but this represents him ditching his previous channel
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   that had already made 100,000 viewers starting all over again and getting back all of those
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   viewers and then some, which I think is doubly amazing because that way you can't say, "Oh,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   oh, he has 100,000 followers.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   I bet it's all bots and I bet it's all people who just watched one video and never came
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   back again."
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.880]   That to me, that's as impressive as a million subscribers, that everybody that was following
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.800]   you on your old channel just came and wanted to come see you with the new one.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   That is such a great achievement.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.920]   And by the way, you're now 121,000, so congratulations.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   Congratulations, you're a loyal number.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.520]   It's all kind of to Laurie for letting me go.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.720]   She let me spread my wings.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.800]   She kicked me out the nest and said, "Fly or drop."
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   Credit to that end.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.080]   I cried as you walked away.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.120]   And the brilliant government of Canada, which provides you with healthcare, so you're at
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.720]   least you're not on the street that way.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   I don't know if I, it's easy to say, but I don't know if I would have done it if I
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.600]   didn't have healthcare because it takes so much pressure.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.920]   Some people think that it's a burden, but it's freedom at the same time.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.080]   Now, how long did it take you to get to 100,000?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   Not that long, right?
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.600]   The first time on the Vector Channel, it took me like a year and a half.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.000]   And on this one, it took me, I think, four months.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Nice.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   That's great.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So, that's great.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And it's well.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   I knew it though.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.120]   I knew Renee was going to just be such a star when he finally took off on his own and wasn't
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.520]   so worried about the general corporation that dictates what we do.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   He just spread so fast.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.680]   I don't have to do a Black Friday special this year, Laurie.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.640]   Aren't you happy about that?
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.440]   Of course, every Friday is a Black Friday now.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.800]   Next stop, Gold Button, Renee Ritchie.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   Congratulations.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   That's exciting.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.440]   I know, that's a million.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   That's hard.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.200]   Do they give a bronze button at all?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.000]   No, it's just not a thing.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.720]   It is gold for a million and then diamond for 10 million.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.040]   And then they've made special one-offs for T-Series and other people who've gotten to
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.160]   50 million and 100 million.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   They should give more than a button.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   Yes.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.760]   Well, I think they made their logos out of Ruby for them when they got to 50 million.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   I forget what they did.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   They should give Ruby.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.760]   I mean, they're making a lot of money off those guys.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.280]   They should really give him a car, give him a gold Ferrari.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.480]   They give him an exclusive deal since they came back from mixer.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.960]   It's all forgiven here.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.840]   No, the real impressive award isn't like the plaque.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.120]   It's when you can willfully spread coronavirus disinformation and they won't block your channel
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   or demand.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   That's when you know.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.760]   That's when you know you've really succeeded on YouTube.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.760]   You've really made it.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.600]   You can burn a mattress in a swimming pool and they go, "Yeah!"
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.480]   All right, let me tell you something else about these Catholics.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.080]   Well, upon review, technically, he did not in his 48-minute rant, violate user guidelines.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.320]   I think that's Facebook, though.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.800]   I think YouTube's like one notch there.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   Oh, no, I agree.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   I agree.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   They at least have some corporate responsibility.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Facebook is like...
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   An ounce of shame.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.120]   They have an ounce of shame still.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   Not a lot, but I know.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.640]   An ounce of shame is better than none.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.480]   I am happy to report there's no epic versus Apple News today.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Well, I saw one thing.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   I saw with the Scott commenting on Tim Epic is new commercial because Ridley Scott famously
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.600]   made 1984.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.160]   He sat down and watched the...
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.200]   I keep calling him Tim Epic because it's hilarious to me.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.520]   They made that new version of it.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   He said, "I watched it.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.000]   The animation was great."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.240]   But I believe he wasted his opportunity to make a broader message about our current situations
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   and culture.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:14.560]   Now, that's pretty cool that somebody got him to sit down and do that.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.320]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   So...
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   I made aliens.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   You make emotes.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   IGN interviewed him and he said, "I wrote to them because on the one hand I can be fully
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   complimented by the fact they copied my commercial shot for shot."
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   But pity.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   The message was so ordinary when they could...
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   I had to say that ordinary.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   When they could have been talking about democracy or more powerful things and they didn't use
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   it.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   Well...
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   Pity.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.600]   In fact, that kind of says it in a nutshell.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.760]   Here we are fighting over the App Store when the whole world is burning.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.760]   But you know what?
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   It's fine.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.360]   It's okay.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.680]   So Epic and Apple will be going to court some year.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   Forever.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.320]   Not this year.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.480]   But Apple, and it's a...
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.840]   I want to say, completely a coincidence, has put its appeal process live.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.120]   They put out a press release.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.400]   This is something that they said they were going to do at WWDC.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.840]   So this has absolutely nothing to do.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.320]   Maybe more to be on the way.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.560]   They were forced to do so by the EU.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   As a matter of fact, to have some sort of arbitration process or make it more transparent.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.240]   So the App Review, this is the simple one paragraph announcement.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.360]   The App Store is dedicated to providing a great experience for everyone.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.800]   Don't forget to continue...
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.960]   You two kids.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   To continue offering a safe place for users to download apps and helping you successfully
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.600]   develop apps that are secure, high quality, reliable and respectful of user privacy.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   We've updated the review process as we announced at WWDC 2020.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440]   It was not...
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.800]   No!
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:05.120]   For apps that are already on the App Store, bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.240]   violations except for those related to legal issues.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.040]   Don't look to us, Epic.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.320]   But that does mean if you're not in court with Apple, I guess...
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.200]   Well, I think it means more like if a record label has complained that you're pirating
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.800]   their music in some way or you're using Calvin and Hobbes in that.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.160]   If it's not like they haven't been given a demand or some sort of legal letter.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   Okay.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.360]   Guidelines violations happen all the time for all sorts of reasons.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Usually the company wants to fix it, but bug fixes are paramount because we don't want
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.760]   any flaws in our software.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.120]   It's the user.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:48.920]   And then it says you'll instead be able to address guideline violations in your next
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.000]   submission.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.880]   So we're going to let you do a bug update as long as in the next submission you respond
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.080]   to our complaint.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.040]   And now in addition to appealing decisions about whether an app violates guidelines,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.280]   you can suggest changes to the guidelines.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.160]   Now, I mean, suggesting changes doesn't mean they're going to do anything.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.480]   Now, but that's worked already.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.720]   I don't know if you saw it, but Will, who makes the Guardian app.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.920]   Will Safik, he's really, really well known.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.680]   Originally, he made some of the jailbreak utilities back in the day and he's become just
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.360]   an A+ security info sec expert.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.920]   He was the one who found all these apps snooping on us and he's the one who did a lot of the
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.400]   Facebook, you know, his circumvention of app store guidelines, research.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.480]   And he has this app Guardian that cuts off all of these third party SDKs from leaking
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.240]   all your information.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.240]   And he had a day pass in it so that if you wanted to just use it for a day, like you
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.760]   were in a sketchy place or you had to do something, it was a one off, you didn't want
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.600]   to pay for a full subscription, you could get a day pass.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.720]   And there was some confusion about whether he could do it.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.600]   So he got stopped by app review and he contested the legitimacy of that regulation.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   And he won just another day.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.880]   He tweeted out that he won and there there.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   I don't know if he was bending changing.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.320]   They're going to make the rules clearer so that it's different between a recurring daily's
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   pass and a one off daily pass, basically.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.600]   Like a skeel or something.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.360]   To me, this just means that it's a good idea for Apple to be under a brighter microscope
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.600]   in terms of how they run the app store.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   Again, I don't know necessarily that that this lawsuit against them has much merit,
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.920]   but I'm very much for them having to come up with a really tight cogent public argument
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.280]   for here's how we run things and use this as an excuse to realize that, okay, let's
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.480]   do our first real overhaul of how we run things to make sure that fewer people are so upset
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.640]   that they're willing to take things to the lawyers.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.400]   That's a pretty minor guideline violation.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.760]   So we'll see how much, but at least something.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.720]   You know, Tim App, Tim Epic is filing one saying need alternate payment system.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.360]   Please remove should all out stores.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.920]   I'm sure he did immediately, right?
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.280]   Should allow third party stores.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.280]   Yes.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.480]   Things like that.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.840]   So I'm sure Apple, but hey, it's a step.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   It's a step.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.480]   And you think it was compelled by the EU.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.440]   You think that was because they didn't have much choice?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   They were facing.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   I know that there was a settlement.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.600]   I don't have the docs in front of me right now, but there was a new EU guideline.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.120]   You've regulation that was coming into effect that basically said that whoever is essentially
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.080]   whatever, however they were running the app store previously was not going to fall in
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.520]   line with these new guidelines.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.440]   And therefore they made the change mostly in reaction to that.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   Again, I'm sorry.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   I don't have the docs in front of me.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   I was.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.800]   My head was in that legal space four weeks ago.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.640]   So I had to generally know.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.080]   I know we move.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.080]   So fast these days.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.720]   I don't know who's suing whom for what now we should point out that.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.640]   Store and review process is fairly important and it's not always perfect.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:12.440]   Lele Hey Newman writing in Wired pointing out that Apple has twice accidentally approved
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.840]   malware to run on Mac OS.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.360]   This is the schlayer adware, which isn't the worst malware in the world.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.360]   It just changes your search to something.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.640]   It's basically adware.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:33.480]   It got by the notarization process once and Apple yanked the certificate, which means
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.320]   I don't think it means it stops running.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.520]   I think it means that they can't download it again.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.720]   You can't install it or run it again without extra steps.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.640]   I felt it dead, but I got it.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   Does it kill it?
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.800]   So I think there was some some of the headlines to this were weird.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.320]   Like nobody submitted malware dot app to the app store and got it approved.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.440]   That's not what happened.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   It's that innocuous looking apps happen to have payloads that contained adware and they
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   got through and they got through twice, which is super embarrassing.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.440]   But it's a cat and mouse game and that exists because the mouse is really, really smart and
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.240]   the cat has to always be vigilant.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.960]   But with notarization, the cat has this giant big red button that that's the key.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.200]   It flaps his hand on it.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   It blows up the man.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   Not a real mouse.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.480]   No real mouse is hurt in the second slide, but it blows up the application and that's
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.960]   sort of the safety net.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.400]   And I always think that no code is going to be perfect.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.360]   No system is going to be foolproof.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.520]   So it's how the company responds to problems when they occur that matters and notarization
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.080]   gives them an extra lever to respond with.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   100%.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.120]   So Patrick Wardle kind of took the lead on this.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   We like Patrick a lot.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.640]   He does a lot of great freeware apps.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   He's a security researcher at Jamf.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.520]   We also like Jamf a lot.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.440]   He's serious.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   So it turns out.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.640]   First of all, and I may have misunderstood this, I didn't think that notarization was
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.800]   as much about looking for malware as it was, as you say, Renee, attaching an identity to
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   an app.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   Yes.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.040]   It's a so that it's approved with developer is and that they have a trusted relationship.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   It didn't.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.400]   I don't I seem remember Apple saying, but we can't we're not.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.680]   This isn't the same thing as app store approval.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.240]   We're not doing a full scan.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   These are quick turnarounds, right?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.960]   They didn't promise that they find malware.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   It nobody should.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.520]   The utilities that they have should detect that when you're downloading it to the Mac,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.440]   that they have several layers that are involved in the gatekeeper system that should quarantine
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.240]   it and scan it.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.160]   And then when you hit the button, if there is a problem with it, it should tell you that
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.880]   rather than just letting you open it.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   Okay.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.320]   That's that we've all seen that.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   Ex protect.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.200]   Yeah, they call it ex protect.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.960]   So Schleier got through Apple Yanks, the developer certificate in the notarization with
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.040]   within an hour.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.400]   It's approved again with a new developer account.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:04.560]   And it turns out, what I think Wardle discovered is that you don't have you anybody can not
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.560]   write an app.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.840]   So they just used a different Apple ID a few hours after Apple began revoking the original
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.920]   certificates.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.160]   And it sounds like, make correct me if I'm wrong, that Apple is allowing this loophole
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:33.040]   that anybody can say, notarize this app to so that enterprise applications can be notarized
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.840]   by any employee or something like that.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.760]   We were talking about it on a Mac on iOS today.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   I didn't quite understand the premise.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   If you I think you just have to prove you haven't like it's you just have to have a
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.200]   developer account doesn't have to be tied to that app, right?
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.560]   Well, you there's two different systems if it because you don't have to you on the Mac,
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.400]   you don't have to use enterprise.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.200]   That's more of an iOS as far as I know, that's more of an iOS construct because there's no
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   gatekeeper on iOS.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.280]   That's sort of a way enterprises can distribute apps outside of the app store sandbox.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.320]   But with this, you have to prove like you can hijack somebody's developer account that's
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.760]   happened in the past too.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.480]   But you basically have to get an approved developer account, which you have to prove
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.120]   you're a business and that you have like you have all the eyes and tees dotted.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.260]   And I don't think that's like I don't think they hire a private investigator to go after
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.260]   you.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.160]   So there is going to be like a certain level of bakery that you can go through on this,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.320]   but you're a real company and that's your app.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.240]   As as Apple has said, this is not the same scanning.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.160]   We're not, you know, it goes through quickly.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.200]   We're not going to find everything.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.760]   That's not what notarization is.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.920]   It's really to attach a person's identity to an app and to allow us to yank it.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   Because once you yank it.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.960]   I can't pretend to be Daniel Jell could and say, no, no, no, this is Mars edit.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.360]   You should download an update to this.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   Really trust me.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   This is Mars edit.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   I'm Daniel.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   I swear.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   Because my signature wouldn't match Mars edit or Daniels notarization certificate.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   Right.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.440]   So it's just it's probably more a thing to be aware of that just just notarization is
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.480]   not really intended to prevent malware.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.920]   It's just to make it less designed.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.320]   I mean, a malware author doesn't want to be identified.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.800]   And there's this $99 speed bump as well, right?
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.360]   And also you can be a totally legit developer and download an SDK off the internet that
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.480]   happens to have malware or spyware and create it in your app and it'll go through as well.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.520]   We've had that happen and then Apple detects it and all those apps go inert or all those
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.160]   apps have to be updated.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.240]   It really is just to prove the identity like it is your choice.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.440]   You are choosing to install apps outside the app store and you get to choose who those
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   apps come from.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   That's the point.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   It is never notarization does not equal app store and you're not going to be as protected
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.480]   as you would be getting it from the app store.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.320]   You're already saying that in gatekeeper.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.080]   No, no, I don't I want to be able to download from third parties.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.720]   And so that you're you're absorbing that risk a little bit and Apple is doing something
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   to help you.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.880]   But now the other question I still not sure is there a kill switch?
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.200]   The certificate can be revoked.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.240]   So the difference between terminal and the toll like open app apps.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   So I won't be able to somebody saying downy this happened to downy last week.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   Yes.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   I can't run downy a few weeks ago.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   Yes.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   Okay.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   So that was that's how they did it.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   They revoked the notarization.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   But how do you revoke notarization on an exit?
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.440]   Oh, so you're saying every time I launch an app it goes to the Apple server and says,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   is this notarized?
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   Is that the case?
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Is it is it is a sign certificate?
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.040]   So it checks the signing authority.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.440]   Interesting.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   And so you can't.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   I'm not a Steve Gibson.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.720]   Yeah, this is complicated because I'll tell you in the in the web world certificate revocation
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.960]   is broken.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.440]   And and no and really doesn't work.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.480]   So is not relied upon for security, but apples.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.480]   This is not the same.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.360]   I mean, it's a certificate, but it's not through a CA like in the web world.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.840]   I presume apples the CA, the certificate authority.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.280]   And it's designed to like if someone modifies and like someone intercepts and that modifies
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.000]   and then tries to send it back on to you.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.560]   For example, the certificate will realize that it's been modified.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.760]   Like there's just a whole bunch of layers of protection in there.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.920]   And do you do you need a developer account to get a certificate?
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   You would, wouldn't you?
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.120]   Well, you've so believe that's how you apply them.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   Well, I think I think part of it is that you can't really build Mac apps unless you're
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   using Xcode.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   Oh, that's true.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.840]   It gives Apple the ability to essentially tag you.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.320]   So yeah, when I when I set up a new Xcode application, it ties it to my if I want to
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.360]   publish, I have to tie it to a developer account.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.120]   And I can write it with I can write Xcode applications without that, but I won't be able
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.600]   to ever publish them.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.800]   So you ties it to your developer account.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.080]   And then if you want to publish it, that's when it will go through the notarization.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.320]   So it is it is tied via that certificate to that developer account.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   Right.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   Okay.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   I apologize.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.160]   I mean, it is it is it is it is a great system because it's one of the reasons why we really
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.280]   don't worry about malware, even though malware happens on the Mac, because Apple
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   Apple's tendency is always to start off with we're going to give users and developers as
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.520]   little power as as we can possibly get away with up to and including not allowing people
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.960]   on iPhones to cut and paste anything between apps.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.400]   But but as we give as we give them power in dribs and drabs, we're going to be doing
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.440]   it in a very controlled fashion where we have thought out here is the worst case scenario
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.720]   and trying to ahead those things off.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.320]   So it is a pain in the butt.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.880]   But the as as I've said before, it is the the Mac world and the iPhone world.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.440]   It's like Disney World where they want you to Apple wants you to have a good time and
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.560]   they were there so they so much want you to have a good time that they're not willing
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.920]   to let you do anything that will have you have a bad time.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.240]   So as Lily Hey Newman points out, this is the first time a notarized app has as far
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.920]   as we know has had malware in it.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.600]   So it's pretty much working on Mac OS.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.440]   I can use Xcode develop a Mac OS app without a developer account and distribute it on my
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   own.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   Yes.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.920]   And that will then gatekeeper will then say no, it's not notarized and I will have to go
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.840]   through that extra step we've talked about before a terminal command or right clicking
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.000]   to open it without notarization.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.320]   I'm making that basically an assertion I know, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.080]   Direct user action trumps the security feature.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   Of course.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.560]   And I think that's a very nice compromise on Apple's part.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   So there's three stages.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.880]   There's app store, which is scanned for malware and is presumably safe.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.400]   There's a not app store, but notarized and that has that extra layer, but isn't guaranteed
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.560]   safe, but at least we can yank it and have a kill switch for it.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.400]   And then there's the third layer where you don't have to have a developer account.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.360]   You can use Xcode Xcode free to everybody, write an app, distribute it on your own, but
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.120]   people will have to jump through a little extra hoop.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.200]   We've all seen that also.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   I can't.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.320]   We in fact, Apple even says in the pop up we can't scan this for malware.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.920]   So I'm not going to open it and then you have to right click and say open it all that.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   Okay.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.960]   It's such a brilliant mechanism because otherwise I know that I would be the sort of like Mr.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   Know it all.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   So well, guess what?
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.120]   I'm going to disable keeper completely if you're going to be such a pain in the butt.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.320]   And then I would lose all the protections as gatekeeper.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.960]   We're asked this willing to say, look, what if I just let you run this one app?
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.680]   Will you still keep on some measure of gatekeeper protection?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.120]   And I have to say, well, I have no reason to object.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   Yes, by all means.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.760]   Apple says, "Notarization gives users more confidence that the developer ID sign software
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.840]   he distributed has been checked by Apple for malicious components.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.880]   But notarization is not app review.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.520]   It's an automated system that scans for malicious content."
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   Okay.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   So it does assert that.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.520]   It's like instruments.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.600]   Checks for code signing issues and returns results to you quickly.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.680]   If there are no issues, it develops a ticket for you to staple to your software and also
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.880]   publishes that ticket online where a gatekeeper can find it.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.480]   And so I guess when you launch an app, gatekeeper goes out and says, let's make sure that that
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.200]   ticket that's stapled under that app is good.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.880]   When the user first installs or runs-- oh, first.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   See, this is what I don't understand.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.280]   I don't know if this is a kill switch.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:13.920]   When the user first installs or runs your software, the ticket is-- gatekeeper then places
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.200]   descriptive information in the initial launch dialogue that helps the user make an informed
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   choice.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.800]   Like, this is where it came from.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.240]   And it was checked for malicious software.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.920]   So-- but I don't know after you've opened it.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.080]   What happens then?
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   It won't run, huh?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.520]   Does it say in the next paragraph?
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   I don't know.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   I keep reading.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.760]   You're not required to notify software.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   He distributed through the app's door.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   The key is compromised.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   [MUMBLING]
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   Take a look.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   I'm looking.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   I'm looking.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   I'm looking.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.840]   And this also verifies the entitlements, which is good.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.600]   So for privacy, it makes sure that the app only does what it asserts it wants to do to
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.120]   protect your privacy.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.280]   I'm still unclear.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.400]   Apparently, Downey was stopped somehow.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   So it must have been.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   That must be how it stopped.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.800]   The reason I ask is it sounds like an issue, because if I'm not online, I might have trouble
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.240]   running that app if it can't verify the ticket.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.400]   I've never seen that happen.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.920]   So it's probably more sophisticated than just that.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.840]   Yeah, also Downey is an unsigned app.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.480]   It's the type of app in between where it's not part of the app's door, I don't believe.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.840]   But they do have an active developer account.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.120]   And they have--
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.360]   I think-- oh, hey, now we've been thinking about it for so long, and I'm doubting my
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.280]   own little name.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.640]   It's pretty clear in here it says, when the user first installs or runs the software,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.120]   it doesn't imply it does it afterwards, just the first time.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.520]   Oh, we don't think it first runs.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.440]   But it can still pull that authentication afterward, as we've seen this time.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   Oh, OK.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   Not not only.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.600]   Maybe it should say, maybe we need some punctuation.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.800]   When the user first installs, comma--
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   Comma.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   --or runs your software.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.280]   Which thing would you use, Octocomas?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:17.480]   So because it's not clear if that first applies to installs and runs.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   Or runs.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   Or runs.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.640]   Is that runs anytime it runs?
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.920]   But for an Oxford comma, there is purgatory Leo.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.400]   We've got to stop with this.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   Lack of clarity.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   Or rows.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   Well, in this case, it needs to be clearer.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.680]   All right, so we'll leave that as an unknown.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.040]   It sounds like they-- but you're going to have to some mechanism for an offline
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.920]   Mac because then you wouldn't be able to run any notarized software.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.320]   Well, down you ran fine when you were offline, but it didn't run fine.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Oh.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.280]   Oh, is that the case?
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   So I've used it when I've been offline.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   OK.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.680]   And it never had an issue with it.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   OK.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   That's interesting.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.360]   But it was only down for less than a day, like 12 hours.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Right.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   So--
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   But they got it down fast.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   Like people were reporting they couldn't launch it fast.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.560]   So there's got to be some cleverness going on there.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.000]   And not only that, but people were-- I'm still running the older version of it.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.160]   In fact, I was-- but people were running the current version.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.040]   We're actually actively getting a warning saying the reason why we're not allowing you
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.840]   to launch this app is because we think this might be malware.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.360]   We're asked on an older version like mine.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.840]   It was just simply bouncing.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   So--
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:29.320]   I think-- and I think the-- however this mechanism works, the big complaint has-- is
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:35.000]   this is an example of the logistical complaint that developers have that the developer of
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.120]   Downey got no word about this.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.960]   No-- nothing from Apple saying, hey, we're pulling your app.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.240]   And only until his mailbox got broken from the weight of people saying, wait a minute,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.760]   your app is filled with malware?
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.080]   There was no knock.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.480]   App Store warrant where they burst into his house, put him down.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   Exactly.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.440]   They were-- they were-- worse than that.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.840]   He was thrown into a truck.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.640]   And then later on, the truck pushed him out backward as home and released him.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.280]   Maybe you have to be online for it to check.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.560]   Like maybe it keeps working until it's online and then it checks and sees it's been revoked.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   I'm just guessing here.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.600]   And Steve is yelling at me through the screen as I realize that.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.080]   Well, Steve will be on in an hour and he can tell us what the truth is of all this.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.200]   I think all four of us are going to-- after the show are going to talk to developers
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.160]   and say, how does this-- I thought we thought we knew the military work.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.960]   We wish we had a clue.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.040]   We have one of you, please, write down how this works.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.520]   Go ask Apple.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.000]   Please.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   I'm reading resolving common notarization issues.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:42.560]   It feels like-- I bet you Apple's intentionally a little bit coy on all this.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.760]   Because they don't-- yeah, they don't really want you to know exactly what's going on.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.920]   I would guess that it doesn't do it every time.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   Periodic.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.160]   Because you don't want it to do it every time.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.520]   That's a lot of necessary network traffic.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.240]   But you would like it once in a while to check it.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.720]   And I bet you it expires after a period of time.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.920]   So well, we haven't checked notarization a week.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   So you better check.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   Oh, like a token.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.640]   And then they could push to override the token if something bad happens.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.640]   Or the--
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   We're defining it ourselves.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   No, it's not.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   It's not.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   It's very new.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.080]   I think they probably know a lot more about this.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   You know what's going on.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   You guys are so dumb.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   All over it.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   This is interesting.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   Keep talking.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.640]   Or the problem with most bureaucracies is that at some point, even the people who run
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.560]   the bureaucracy do not know how it works anymore.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.480]   All they know are the rules that have been written down for how it works.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.680]   And that's why it gets so frustrating to you.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.400]   Once again, how do I pay this bill for $0.00 and $0.00 since you sent me?
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.160]   And now you're saying that you're going to cut off my service unless I pay this bill.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.680]   And the person who's on customer service does not know why this bill got sent.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.920]   They only know that if you don't pay the bill, I know I've got a page of the manual for that
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.640]   as opposed to I don't know why this rule was made.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.920]   They forgot somehow because of all this, my Verizon line for mobile nations didn't get
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   canceled.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.360]   And so they locked me out of the website so I couldn't cancel it myself.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.720]   I didn't know what to do because they wanted me to go to a physical Verizon store and we
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.320]   weren't allowed crossing borders.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   So I just waited.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   I didn't do anything.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   And then I started getting calls from collection agencies.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.520]   And they called me and then said, "We need to identify you.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   Give us your social insurance number."
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.960]   And I said, "I'm not American.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.200]   I don't have one."
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.640]   And that totally flummoxed them for like a month and a half.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.840]   They kept calling demand.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.360]   And I said, "I'm not American."
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.720]   And then finally got to speak to a supervisor who said, "This is the most asinine thing I've
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   ever heard of.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.000]   Just give me your information.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I'll cancel this.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.360]   We'll never hear from us again."
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   No kidding.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.600]   Apple in the consumer documentation says first run, first install.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.680]   It's very clear on that.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.400]   It doesn't say anything about subsequent checks.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.280]   I suspect there are subsequent checks but they're just being coy about it.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.920]   There's something else going on.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.000]   Or again, a poor system where it doesn't check anymore but it can push and say the certificate
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   has been revoked.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Right.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   It has to allow for offline use.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.800]   That's why I'm wondering if it's just a token that can expire.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   And once it expires, it has to check back to mama at some point.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   And that's otherwise...
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   It may not run.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   It may say, "Oh, I can't.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   I'm offline.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   I can't run.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   I can't run.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   I can't run.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.880]   But it will continue to try until it does get online.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.280]   And then if it's been revoked, it'll go, "Oop, can't run."
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.080]   And with Downie, you can't really use it offline anyway because you don't have to download
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   it.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   Exactly.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   Well, and that's a lot of malware.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.320]   If you're not online, who cares if you have it, right?
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   Exactly.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   It doesn't really...
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.640]   It's not going to do anything.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   That's interesting.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   This is an interesting question.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   All right.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.960]   We have much more to talk about, including rumors which I don't buy for one second.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   Rumas, LaPont.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   LaPont.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   Rumas.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   I don't buy them.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   There are a few rumors.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   I don't buy them for one minute.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.560]   Rumas and Scannerly.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:58.360]   I'm getting so many flashbacks to a kid and not the national Sunday morning news chat
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.600]   shows, but the local ones where they'd have somebody, some formal lawyer who'd come by
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   at seven p.s.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.360]   And the thing is, I don't understand what this new student's work act is all about.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   They said last year that they would not, they would be an annuity and not a bond issue.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.720]   We're going to get some people to talk to so bad.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   Explain it to me.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.360]   Explain it to me like I'm a five-year-old.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.520]   Well, we'll do that.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.600]   We'll explain it like we're five-year-olds in moments.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.440]   Can you believe it's September 1st?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.640]   What the hell happened here?
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.640]   We are.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.760]   I tore all my calendars and clocks down off the wall.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   They were just giving me news.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   I did not want to ask.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   Yes.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.920]   I don't need to know that.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.880]   Our show today brought to you by a fine sponsor whose name I will tell you as soon as I find
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.960]   it, ZipperKruder.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.880]   Hi, ZipperKruder.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   We use ZipperKruder.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.280]   This is more than a sponsor for us.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:58.360]   This is a tool we use every time we need to hire somebody at Twit.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.160]   If you're doing hiring, right now it's tough, but I want to say, if you're an employer who's
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.760]   hiring, bless you.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   Bless you.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.400]   There are a lot of people out there who are dying for a job, and I can promise you a perfect
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   person is somewhere out there looking for you, begging for you, desperate for you.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.640]   ZipperKruder is the best way to match employers up with employees because, well, first of
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.680]   all, as soon as you post as ZipperKruder, it goes to 100 job boards more than so you're
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.400]   casting the widest net possible.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.280]   But it also does an amazing thing.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   It does some matching.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   I'll give you an example.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.480]   There is a company called a construction company called GS Group.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.120]   Their HR Monica Starks had an important job to fill, but she couldn't find the right
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   person.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.200]   There were so many candidates.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.680]   She switched to ZipperKruder.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.080]   She was trying to do something else before because it makes it all easy.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.360]   That's when ZipperKruder's technology kicks in.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.200]   It identifies people.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.520]   It looks at your listening and says, "Oh, because ZipperKruder has more than a million
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.240]   current resumes in their database."
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:10.760]   They look at your job opening and they match it to people in their database, people looking
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   for work with the perfect experience.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.560]   It doesn't just send them to you.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.280]   It actively invites them to apply.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.320]   They said, "Look, Monica's got a great job.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   You think you'd be good for this?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.200]   Would you like to apply?"
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.040]   And this is why you should try ZipperKruder for free at zipperkruder.com/macbreak because

[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   That's how Monica found her new hire, Lamont Jenkins.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:44.280]   She said ZipperKruder sent Lamont's profile to her five minutes after she posted the
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.520]   job because he was perfect.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.720]   Our experience has been the same.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.960]   ZipperKruder is so effective.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.320]   80% of employers who post on ZipperKruder say they get a quality candidate within the
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.400]   first day.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.720]   And then I got to tell you, they don't go to your email or your phone.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.040]   They go into the ZipperKruder interface, so you're not going to get overloaded.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.120]   ZipperKruder interface makes it really easy to screen rank and hire the right person fast.

[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.560]   It reformats all the resumes to a standard format so it's easy to scan through them.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.600]   They even highlight the best candidates so they go right to the top.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.520]   ZipperKruder makes the entire process efficient and effective.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.560]   And I think it really works.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   You will too.

[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.560]   Thank you.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.480]   And I know you're frazzled.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.840]   It's the hiring process is scary because you're literally, these are the building blocks that
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.400]   make your company or break your company.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.480]   And you always, it's almost always you're doing it when you're short handed.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.280]   So take advantage of this.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.400]   zipperkruder.com/macbracacmacbreak.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   ZipperKruder.com/macbreak.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.840]   ZipperKruder.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.640]   It's the smartest way to hire.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.520]   Thank you, ZipperKruder, for making it possible for some great employees to find work in a
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.080]   very difficult time.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.560]   We really appreciate it.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.960]   Okay, first we got it.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.400]   I have to give you some good news.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.680]   Apple TV plus is going to debut.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.800]   Mariah Carey's magical Christmas special for the holidays.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   Okay.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   Okay.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:41.160]   Oh, and you know what I said, I never want to hear again.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:47.480]   Can I say that I had to confess to myself that Mariah Carey has passed the Scrooge event
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:53.920]   horizon where it's like at this point, I've heard my nieces and nephew sing all I want
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.200]   for Christmas is you at so many family Christmases that I have decided that for me to be against
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:04.240]   this song and against this holiday performer would identify me as having a Scrooge like
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.440]   tendencies and therefore Merry Christmas one and all.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.280]   A lot of us are coming up against our one year deadline because if you bought the iPhone
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:21.800]   11 and got your free Apple TV plus subscription in the next month or so, maybe in the next
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.680]   few weeks, you're going to be charged for Apple TV plus.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.160]   Will you though, like I feel like they can't, they can't, I feel like they're going to have
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.720]   to do by another phone and we'll give you another year scratching 2020 off the list.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.760]   It didn't really happen the way it was.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   How does that work?
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.040]   Because I bought an Apple TV a few months ago.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   But I mean, I don't know.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.880]   Is it going to notice that and give me another six months or what?
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.360]   No, I think it goes based off your Apple ID.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:58.240]   So whenever you, whenever you subscribe to TV plus with that Apple ID, that's when the
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   time starts.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   But the Apple TV I bought is the same Apple ID as my iPhone 11.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.760]   So you don't get a, you don't get more?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.320]   No, I don't think so.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.720]   I think it's only, it starts the time that you triggered it.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.320]   So it starts on, you know, October 15th or whenever it started and it, and it, it doesn't
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.280]   renew or change with new devices.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   So I have to decide.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:28.240]   The different persons Apple ID, you know, with, with that Apple TV, you might be able
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.360]   to get like another.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.120]   Even if that person maybe is in your family.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.720]   How does family sharing work?
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   I don't think so.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:43.000]   I think if it's family sharing, it's one, it's one subscription across the board.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.840]   Because I buy, I will be buying three new iPhones.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.000]   But don't you feel like they're going to have to announce this?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.880]   Like they're going to have to, because nobody's going to resubscribe.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.120]   There's just, there's not been any content and there's no content in the pipeline.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.080]   Well, there's very little, there's Mariah Carey's Christmas special.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   And there's a foundation.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   Ted Lassett.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.080]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.360]   Foundation I will resubscribe for.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   But when does that come out?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.000]   It's going to be a huge drought.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Supposedly next year.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.800]   But like, again, who knows with 2020?
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.240]   2020 is a watch.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.840]   Nobody can include 2020 in anything.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   Right.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.040]   What I'm thinking is that you might be very right.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   They might decide that we're just going to give everybody an extra year.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.720]   But I was thinking that given that there are so many sensible, sensible theories that
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.680]   Apple might start creating a bundle.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.320]   This would be a wonderful time for them to announce a bundle for people, people who are
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.800]   realizing that, oh, by the way, I'm about to lose Apple TV.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   Apple TV.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.720]   I'm not sure if it's worth like the full price, but gee, for only like $4 more than what I'm
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   spending for iCloud plus Apple music, I can keep it.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   Okay.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   That's worth keeping.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   We know that bundle's coming.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   So maybe that's the key.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.800]   Now I have till November 4th, according to, you know, if you go to your settings on your
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.080]   iPhone or your iPad and you tap your head, you know, you tap your count, there's, there's
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   a subscription.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.080]   They, they hide it.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.920]   You poke yourself in the face, poke yourself in the face.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.320]   And then they'll be in the menu after that subscriptions.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:11.000]   And then you scroll through and you get Apple TV plus and it says mine renews November 4th,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   2020.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.720]   I got to figure that that's the soonest anybody will be because I ordered the iPhone the minute
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.080]   it was available.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.280]   So mine renews November 1st.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   Son of a.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.080]   You got a three days sooner.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.520]   So I still pay for Apple news and there's no freebie.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.760]   Let's compare notes.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   So here's the deal.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.560]   If I press cancel free trial, normally you would get till November 1st.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.200]   If you cancel you and your family members will immediately lose access to Apple TV plus
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.920]   and the remainder of one year, one year free trial, you're a certificate.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.080]   You cannot reactivate this trial.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.840]   So don't even think about it.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.160]   Miss can't handle this trial.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.240]   So it's $4.99 a month, which it's going to auto renew.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.360]   But I don't want to cancel now.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.280]   I got at least till November 1st.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.520]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.120]   They should all be like when you cancel, you get till the end of the trial.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.920]   Normally you get to the end of the trial.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.560]   That's how everything works.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.880]   Or 50 bucks a year.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.440]   I can't see any reason to renew.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.280]   I've watched everything I wanted to watch.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.680]   Greyhound again?
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.080]   Well, maybe.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.880]   Mike, I want to know.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.840]   I think I'm going to officially disagree.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.200]   I used to be in agreement with you.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.800]   But I started spending more time in the TV app.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:33.200]   And I've realized that not only are there Apple exclusive TV shows that they've been
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.560]   putting out and some documentaries and things like that too.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:42.920]   But they've also been adding different movies to their list of things that you can watch
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.560]   through TV plus.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.280]   They are actually adding more content.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   I hear Ted Lasso is pretty good.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.920]   I will resubscribe for Ted Lasso.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.040]   That show has won me over.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.960]   It's so charming and so endearing.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.960]   And kind of funny.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.760]   You can say it's corny at first, but then you just can't help but like him.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   It's true.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   And you end up liking it.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.960]   It's just so right now we need heartwarming.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.600]   It's also funny, but it's not PG quality stuff.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:24.120]   It's funny and a little bit on the Raunchy side, but your Ted Lasso character is just
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.440]   so endearing that.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.080]   The show is so fantastic.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.400]   It's the first time a TV plus show has been out where every week when it comes out, I
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.800]   want to watch it right away.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   Okay.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.080]   Because I have to say, morning show.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   See.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.160]   For all mankind.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.760]   The end of morning show was still the best thing I saw on TV that year.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.120]   But you had to watch every episode so that you could get that payoff in one episode at
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.920]   the end.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   The rest of the-
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   I think like three.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   I could argue like three of the-
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   Yeah, no, that's fair.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.160]   But I think that shows that it could be a good-
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.640]   Like, I'm going to give morning show season two if they ever get it done.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Oh, look.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.320]   Like, I just have resubscribed to crave for Doom Patrol season two.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.160]   So obviously for me, it's now I don't subscribe and then I wait till the other show I really
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.600]   want and that show is finished and I can watch the whole thing on the weekend.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.640]   And then I subscribe for the month.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.400]   I hear little America's good.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.880]   I hear little voices.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   There's two little-
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.880]   Central Park is good.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.400]   I tried Central Park.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   I can't.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   I tried.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.560]   It took me like three episodes to get into.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   Okay.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   I was happy with that.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.400]   I'll give it some more time.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.560]   Traglerock is Fraglerock.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.560]   There is-
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.680]   Truth be told, I was going to watch it.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.760]   Then I found out it's about a podcaster and I thought, "I'm not watching a show about a
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   podcaster."
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.040]   Oh, the home is something-
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.600]   I can't remember the name of the show.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.320]   It has to do with home.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.160]   I watched the first two episodes.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:50.040]   It's very, it's very Apple, but it's also, it's pretty interesting.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.880]   Just seeing this amazing architecture.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.080]   I did watch the first one.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.720]   I watched the one where they built a house within the house so they could have a Mediterranean
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.160]   climate in Sweden.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.480]   But you know what I mean by it's so design.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   It's so Apple.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.560]   I don't like it as much as the home show.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.880]   It goes on Bravo or whatever, you know, like whatever crap channels.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.840]   Well, Netflix had that amazing show about crazy homes and really-
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   Love that.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   --of land-ish places.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   I love that.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   I was on a cliff or something.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.360]   And I like tiny houses.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360]   I like-
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.240]   What's the one where they're building off the grid?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   I like that.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.160]   Don't you want a normal house made out of tiny houses?
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Like you stick through your four tiny houses.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   Oh, brilliant.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.720]   It'd be like a hamster habitat.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Just put tubes.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.560]   You have tiny houses and tiny houses and then have tubes between them.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.160]   Do you have to crawl through the tubes?
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   No.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Here's what you do.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:50.480]   You keep surfing like Facebook, local and Craigslist for like dilapidated like RVs and
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   boats.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.280]   Oh, you can just keep them all up.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.800]   That's basically $200 just get it off my property.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.720]   And then all you have to do is like build like then go to the home's home store, get
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:04.240]   like sheds and like you install the sheds between the boats of the RVs and they'll throw
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.080]   like the habit trails that connect all these living spaces.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.760]   Andy actually just described my retirement plans.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:21.120]   Or buy an old 747 and just land it somewhere and that's your house.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.880]   Your house in Larry's old 747.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.200]   Just buy that put it in the tarmac in a desert where it won't grow.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   One of those shows had that had a lady living in an old 747.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.640]   It wasn't as luxurious as you would imagine.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.200]   It's kind of ratty.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.480]   All right, home.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.960]   I'll have to watch more home.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.800]   The problem with shows like this is I get jealous.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   I go, why am I?
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.840]   How come I'm not living there?
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:50.120]   It's a, well, it's a tough strategy where it's like there are all kinds of places where
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.360]   you would love to Airbnb there for a week.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.520]   Maybe you'd like to live there for a month.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.360]   But after a while when you realize that I've got, I've got to, I have a couple of people
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.560]   who are who have that sort of minimalist lifestyle where they can live their lives where, hey,
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.440]   I just bought this bottle of bottled water.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.120]   Now what, what inside my house are I going to throw away to make room for this bottled
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:17.720]   water where it has to be a zero sum proposition.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.040]   And that's the thing that would kill it for me.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.560]   I need to be able to like say, hey, look, here's a really cool vintage tape deck that
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.480]   I don't really need, but it's about the cost of a large pizza.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.640]   And I don't have to, I don't have to think about, but I don't have that will displace
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.160]   how many cubic feet of oxygen for my living space.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.280]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's the problem I have with this Swedish house inside a greenhouse.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.520]   When you open the windows, you don't get any fresh air.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.800]   You just get more stale air.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.880]   I know that the green greenhouse.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.280]   And I don't think you open the greenhouse windows because it's 40 below outside.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   So right.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   It seems like a good idea.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   So you're a bomb.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   What?
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.440]   Also, Swedish people didn't see your bones.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.920]   You see all the, all the windows there?
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   I don't want to go with that.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.240]   Well, Swedish people walk around naked all the time.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240]   I don't think they care.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   Well, they're Swedish people.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   They're not Americans.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   They don't have that corn syrup subsidy like ruining their own health.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:21.160]   I do like this idea.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:27.120]   There is, by the way, there is a house in Petaluma, which is a bunch of little houses
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.720]   and they have little paths between them.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.640]   Oh, no, maybe I saw this on TV.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.360]   I want to see this on TV.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.960]   And like the teenagers each have their own house and mom and dad have their own house
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.400]   and they're naked and there's a dining room house and they can walk.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.440]   It's like a bunch of tiny houses, but you need the habitats.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.560]   I think you need the tubes.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.560]   I'm just saying, have a trail.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   That's it.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.240]   Yeah, you need the tubes and maybe a wheel that you can just run on.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.440]   You got more energy.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.440]   Exercise.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   That's the exercise room.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440]   The exercise room.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   Oh, I have one of those actually.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.240]   You run and you go nowhere.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.040]   I am a hamster.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.600]   All right.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.120]   Rumor central.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.520]   I don't, there was a rumor.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.840]   I completely discount about the first Apple Silicon Mac.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.160]   This was on Twitter by somebody I never heard of.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.960]   I thought I'd just ask you guys.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   Do you know Lars for example?
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.840]   Well, when I say that everybody has a Twitter account leaking now, ever since a bunch of
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.840]   people started leaking on Twitter.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   There's 19,000 Twitter accounts all named Apple Leaker_0.379.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.000]   And they just put up leaks and there's nothing.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Nothing, no history.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.280]   And people are blogging them.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.000]   Not Laurie of course because Laurie is a fine intelligent editor.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.040]   But other sites like big sites are like this person who's never tweeted before has tweeted
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.200]   out that this thing is happening with the iPhone and it's on Twitter.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.920]   So we're going to just blog.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:58.800]   According to Tom's guide, the first R Mac books will be revealed at the October 27th
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   Apple event.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   What?
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.120]   What October 27th Apple event?
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   That's also a rumor.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.000]   But I would say there's a possibility.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.280]   They said by the end of the year and maybe you could buy it on October 7th.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.600]   But maybe they would say, yeah, this is it.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.400]   You'll buy it November 15th, you know, like that.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   There's a good.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:28.360]   This comes from Apple Leaker, Comiyaki J.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.080]   We don't know anything about this.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.680]   I love to dream as a good track record.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.080]   Like there's one that's called.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.160]   I did a video on the weekend where I responded to Reddit threads, which was probably a very
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   bad idea.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.600]   So you think this is the end of the this love to dream one is Chinese account.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.640]   So that would be maybe a supply chain.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.720]   At the end of the yeah, but at the end of the episode, I did like a classic Tiers you
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.240]   style S tier A tier for all the leakers.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   Okay.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.320]   Just based on their Apple track.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.480]   There's a site called Apple track that leaks all the percentage sorry that lists all the
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.760]   percentages of accuracy for everyone and leaking anything in the last two years.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.360]   So you think that love to dream is is one of the better.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:10.960]   He has he and the information have the highest their S tier there of 90% tiles accuracy rates.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:17.720]   And then Mark Herman is like in the 80% John John Prosser's and 70% so what is love to
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   dream saying?
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.320]   I don't think he said much recently.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:24.520]   He just said there's going to be a Mac book.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:32.060]   Yeah, that's the widely accepted the consensus rumor is I saw one probably tweet probably
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.100]   in tier eight.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.760]   If there be such a low tier that said it's going to be just a Mac book nothing just and
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   it will look like the Mac book nothing but it'll have 20 hours of battery life.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   Does that credible?
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:49.240]   There's two competing rumors one that is going to be a 13 inch MacBook Pro the same
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.800]   30 inch MacBook Pro that we have.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   That's the one I want.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.760]   And the other rumor says it's going to be a 12 inch MacBook with an A with with the current
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.720]   iPad Pro chip which is the oh no that's a mistake.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   Yeah, Z.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:10.400]   But that my understanding is that Apple Silicon has specific silicon for Macs like it has
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.080]   stuff in it that you wouldn't need on an iPhone or iPad right?
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.240]   Yeah, it's vice versa.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.640]   So yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me that they would launch with a rehash iPad chip
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.360]   that's been higher than two years ago.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.400]   That's the whole point of having custom silicon cut but the word custom implies that you get
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.320]   to customize it for the task at hand.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:36.520]   Yeah, we know that the A12 runs fine because that's the that's the test beta box that they
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:41.240]   gave everybody but it's not the and we saw stuff running on it runs fine but it runs
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.440]   fine is not what Apple wants for their first app Silicon.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.840]   I also think I'm skeptical of anything that says the design will be the same.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.440]   Yeah, that's economical.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   You already have a design.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   It works.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   It's loved.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:59.160]   But I would think you would want I would I mean look the next iPhone rumor says it's
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.560]   going to be blue not green.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.840]   You do that so that people can look at it and go you have the new one because otherwise
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.040]   it's a slab of glass.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:12.600]   So if you if they perfected the if they've perfected the MacBook look why would they
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:18.160]   change the design because you need to leave the MacBook Pro has the perfect design.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   I agree.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160]   I don't I don't agree.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   I agree.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.880]   Looking one but you could say that about the Corvette.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:29.160]   But in 1960 Corvette had the perfect design.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.440]   Why do we keep changing it?
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.360]   Because you have to have somebody say oh you have the new one.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.040]   But but at the same time doesn't everybody like the 1967 Corvette better than the one
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.360]   that you can buy off the lot in 2020.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.600]   Everybody's wishing for that old design.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.960]   You know so like once you've perfected the design why change it that's that's that's
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:57.560]   I feel that very strongly and I think that when it comes to the MacBook lineup and I
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:02.280]   think the iPad or the iPhone lineup they've perfected the design they don't need to change
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   it.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:10.000]   I think I have a guess in in into like agree with you Leo I think color changes might be
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   the thing.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   So make it blue.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.040]   A new right or you know like the new MacBook.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   Like the fins you need something.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   Right.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   Like an Edsel.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.400]   No I guess though I think it's way more practical and pragmatic than that because when they
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.960]   switched from power PC to Intel a lot of stuff did not get a redesign.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.160]   It was like we're introducing them Mac mini 2005 2006.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.360]   Here's the Intel version.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   It's exactly the same.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.520]   So my guess is that the the industrial design team still has limited bandwidth and they can
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.560]   get through a certain number of devices every year and it's just not practical for them to
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.480]   push out over the next two years.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   Okay.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   Every new Apple design.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.320]   They're going to continue with whatever design cadence they had set up and just switch them
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.560]   to Mac silicon because they're a known target like they know exactly what the thermal envelope
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.240]   for all of these designs are.
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.600]   It takes a huge amount of pressure over not shooting an arrow into an arrow into a target.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.560]   You know the target is set for the for whatever they want to package up and so we'll get like
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.560]   the 13 inch MacBook Pro this year with Apple silicon and then next year we'll get the 14
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.680]   inch model that has the new design and then it'll keep sort of and they can they can make
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.680]   us buy that thing twice.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.440]   I think we got the Apple Silicon one and they're.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:22.360]   They should go to Chevrolet and say can we can we reuse the 1963 stingray fuel injected
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:31.000]   split window coupe design in Rose gold in Rose gold and we'll just put Apple Silicon
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.080]   in the trunk and we'll be good.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.280]   You have to have a new figure to watch the old design.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:43.040]   My my big I'm still kind of wrestling with a question of what makes more sense for their
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:49.600]   first for their debut Apple Silicon Mac a pro a pro labeled one or a consumer labeled
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   one because if you have if you decide your first one's going to be an iMac or a Mac book
[00:59:54.600 --> 01:00:01.440]   nothing you have a you have a user base whose expectations are not terribly high for performance
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.120]   but you can deliver some really really exceptional results for them very very quickly in the
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.240]   forms of in forms of battery life and performance per dollar.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:17.040]   However if you go for the pro market you are dog fooding on a species of dog that's not
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.360]   used to being treated well to begin with so these are these are people who probably going
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.560]   to be a little bit more conservative these are going to be the people who can be the
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.120]   most useful first generation of users to such a revolutionary.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.960]   A misconception of the Mac I I'm still I'm still hoping that the first one is a Mac book
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:41.520]   nothing because if there are only goal for the first Mac or would be to let's make a
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   let's make a version of the iPad that is essentially a Mac not I'm not even necessarily
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.040]   saying a tablet style Mac or something that doesn't have a keyboard I'm saying give us
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.680]   something that's about a thousand bucks or less that is real super super super super
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.960]   thin and light that doesn't necessarily run all the apps are out there maybe even would
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.920]   be not not necessarily practical for Photoshop not necessarily practical for for professional
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:12.000]   video editing but the sort of thing where I can finally have a Mac where I'm not really
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.080]   sure the last time I charged it and I'm not really sure that's even relevant that I know.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:23.240]   Yeah I think that's what the rumor was kind of was that 12 inch Mac book nothing with really
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.280]   long battery life super thin.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:33.400]   Yeah I'd buy that it did rumor also said butterfly for keyboard that's possible I mean I hate
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.120]   the idea but it's possible because Apple very carefully when they announced the magic keyboard
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.440]   said that they weren't closing the door on butterfly they were just you know talking about
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.320]   this and it could I'm sure there's like inside they're like it we did it for these reasons
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.000]   to make an ultra thin 12 inch keyboard and it makes sense there and we're going to show
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.320]   you that we were right about it that we were doing and I just like please no just please
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:01.120]   like you had four shots at it no like it's not a redemption story for you anymore it's
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.520]   a toxicity story for users just let it die.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.800]   We're pleased to say we took everything that made the magic keyboard a big success across
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:18.000]   the platform and reinvented it for 2021 yes the beatings will continue until morale improves
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   you're welcome.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.200]   What is it butterfly for the conjuring is that?
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.000]   It was perfect let's say by some engineering miracle it was perfect it was the best keyboard
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.920]   they ever made just merely mentioning those words nobody's going to trust it they're going
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.800]   to insist on a year like like replacements for five years are going to wait a year before
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.640]   they buy it just to see if Casey Johnson has any problems with it it's I can't understand
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.800]   how you would go to market on it.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:51.520]   All right well we'll see I think believe it or not weirdly enough it's only a few weeks
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.240]   off yeah I know I'm a colleague Hulk and his 40 I can't take any.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.600]   Oh yeah wasn't that a funny tweet.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   I'm sick.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.640]   90 yeah that's amazing isn't it.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:11.200]   We'll there so we're also trying to figure out when because we want to cover any iPhone
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:19.160]   announcement there was a rumor I think based on this YouTube slip up that maybe it be September
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:25.440]   10th I think that's because it was September 10th last year right when now if it's September
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.200]   10th you would guys would be getting your invitation in a couple of days.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.160]   Oh right well not for virtual isn't it.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.360]   What do they do for virtual they don't send invitations.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.960]   They did for WDC but I don't think it was that.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:45.560]   Yeah it was an actual invitation but it wasn't it was like a few days beforehand yeah so they
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.360]   like they don't have to plan as far ahead of time.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.000]   So like give you the time you need to like make your travel arrange.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.200]   I need to plan I gotta make room in our schedule.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.920]   Let me know.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:02.720]   So there are two big rumors coming coming around and the first one is that that Apple
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:10.360]   might drop a couple of products next week during it's like the week of September 7th.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.880]   So to me personally I think it would be September 8th because that's a Tuesday after Labor Day
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:21.280]   or day yeah and that's normally when Apple does it had its its iPhone event right and
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.400]   we already know that the iPhone is going to be delayed but that doesn't mean that they
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.760]   can't just announce new products and the rumor is that it's going to be a new Apple Watch
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.400]   and possibly a new iPad and I think the rumor is that it's going to be a brand new design
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.680]   of an iPad Air.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   Yes.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   So it might just be another version of my iPad.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:45.880]   This is the Mark Gurman Debbie Wu Bloomberg story Apple preparing 75 million 5G iPhones
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.280]   alongside new watches and new iPads.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.880]   So that could be that test on YouTube that that drop that could have been them preparing
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:05.600]   for their like you know their little commercial that they're going to put out you know not
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.920]   commercial but you know their presentation of it that they're going to present is so
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:18.600]   without an actual virtual event they might have something planned to go along with announcing
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.520]   a new Apple Watch and a new iPad.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.400]   So I don't totally think that test was completely off the mark.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.600]   I think there's a chance that that was a week from Thursday.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.920]   Yeah that there might be some reason why that was that was there.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.560]   So you know that's just me like giving my fun little.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:45.240]   According to the Gurman 4 new phones two basic two high end models all with OLED displays
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:56.120]   a 5.4 inch size and a 6.1 inch size for the regular the pro devices 6.1 and 6.7 which
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.880]   will be the largest iPhone ever.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.920]   Squared edges like the iPad Pro back to the squared edges that's the fins by the way that's
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.840]   just so you can look at it go either you have an iPhone 4 or you have an iPhone 12 and these
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.680]   are all well established like this stuff has been rumored for a good year now from a variety
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.600]   of sources high end phones will use state stainless steel aluminum size and the cheaper
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.840]   phones the dark blue color I mentioned on the pro models to replace midnight green again
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:30.600]   fins because you know color that's easy at least two of the larger pro phones will have
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:37.680]   the same LIDAR camera as on the latest iPad Pro by the way I have that iPad Pro I have
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:44.440]   never used the LIDAR camera ever have you any better measure stuff or barrisingly is
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.680]   it so fast to measure things I whenever I want to buy something now I just pull that
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.880]   out because it's easier than you could find the tape measure it's not a selling point
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.760]   it's not like oh I got it it's gonna be better on the phone for a variety of reasons because
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.600]   it's gonna be it's they didn't have time to do all the stuff with the camera app like
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.480]   they literally did not have time to build the camera app into LIDAR for the iPad doesn't
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.840]   even do doesn't even do what's it called the depth effect if you press the depth effect
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.480]   button it spins around and gives you the front facing camera and I hate myself every time
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:19.040]   I know but they've been working on it for this so this is going to have a fully fun that
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.200]   fully functional AR camera that we've been hearing rumors about right for years and everything
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.840]   from focus to depth to all these things are going to improve because it's gonna have that
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.680]   laser be very cool so it's essentially the front facing cameras capabilities going out
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.260]   the back more data range just more yeah yeah and better for obviously for AR for the
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.260]   again fewer points more range I know you say are there'll be less dots but further out
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.920]   AR at this point is just a gimmick unless I guess you do a lot of like you're so lucky
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:54.560]   Alex isn't here or you sir oh yeah any any any any hardware component that allows more
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.080]   that brings in more data for computational photography is going to have a really wonderful
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.880]   effect particularly the way that Apple does it you know you may not expect it on on other
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:08.600]   manufacturers but the fact that the fact that Google's pixel phones are still reusing like
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.800]   a two or three year old sensor and yet they're with modern software it keeps achieving parity
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   with the latest and greatest that's out there from just by anybody else shows you how good
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.960]   this is going to be once that's added to the mixture was that that's added to the soup
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.240]   it's the one thing I didn't see in those rumors though is that there's still a couple of things
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.520]   that have been floating for the past year Apple tags the new Apple air air they're new
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.960]   I don't know whether calling the new over the ear headphones versions of the AirPods it's
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.040]   it's there's a lot there's a lot that is sort of float hovering in the air waiting to be
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.560]   pulled down and announced at an event well we'll see if it weren't for okay now I know
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.840]   it looks like I'm wearing a dog must we know what what what do you do in your your time
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.760]   you look like you look like you're one of those people who goes to Walmart to pick a
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.360]   fight oh I'm wearing a mask I'm wearing a mask problem what's the problem huh listen
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.680]   are you raid boss Karen right now Leo are you raid boss yeah that's it that's me no but
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:14.480]   this is the one thing I use that LiDAR for yeah was that Bellos 3D app yeah that did
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:20.280]   a 3d very quick nice 3d scan on my head and then I ordered from a 3d printing supply company
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:26.280]   actually they make dental parts teeth and stuff this is made out of the same material
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   as my teeth a mat what they call a mask fitter which goes over a mask and seals it and actually
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.680]   dentists use this you'll see these in some medical offices too because you could take
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.760]   an inexpensive paper surgical mask put this over it and it's an N95 mask all of a sudden
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.800]   because it's different than when Anthony Hopkins was put in the right if memories hers
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.840]   I have that one also I don't know if you're wearing that one it's creepy that's not trapping
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.120]   any spit I would not walk past his cell if you were wearing what Leo is wearing right
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.000]   now no no no no you put the paper mask on and then you put this over it and then see because
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.200]   the paper mask has these little holes on the side but when you put the and then you attack
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:09.400]   Batman right the fitter over it you look like Bane but and you you sound like me and then
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.560]   now it's a it's a good fit and and I've tested this by the way going outside it's very smoky
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.920]   still in the Petaloma terribly smoky and will be all week but you can't smell the smoke
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.160]   through this which tells me it's doing this to me but you learn to podcast I was born
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:31.360]   to I was yeah that's that's a that's a trick that I think most manufacturers are missing
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   with these things you can do with this yeah no no I'm saying once once you start to teach
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.160]   people that part of the core competency of a top to your phone is that it can capture
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.520]   3d data and not just to do this pie in the sky AR stuff that they keep promising is coming
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.400]   but it means that if you have an object if you if you have an object that you'd like
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.040]   to make a 3d model this is no longer something you have to be Alex Lindsey to do here is it'll
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.760]   be just as easy as registering your face for face ID or if you want to do a 3d picture
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:09.040]   of 3d shots of your kids all and if you want to make models that can then be printed with
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.360]   shape ways or be sent press a button instead of remember with Apple photos used to have
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.920]   the ability to hey this is a good picture please send me a print of this back when people
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.160]   actually had physical like tree where photos imagine saying this is a really good object
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.200]   that I've just made please send me in plastic or in metal or whatever once people see that
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.080]   magic it'll be I think it'll be a lot like the first time we were able to burn CDs it's
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.120]   something that what my god we're we were not supposed we were we never had this power to
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.800]   actually manufacturers a compact disc for God sakes I feel drunk with a with a power of a
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.120]   galaxy in my hand when you have the ability to manipulate 3d data as easily as you can manipulate
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.680]   2d data that could be of that that's the sort of thing that would get people to say
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.920]   at the when they're at the AT&T store at the Verizon store or for $125 more here here here
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.120]   take a picture of your kid with this camera I was like oh wow look you it's actually got
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.120]   like her face and her profile and now you can actually send pictures you can actually animate
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.880]   her onto this and that and the other that's the sort of stuff I'm really looking forward to
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.320]   that will get me excited about not buying a $350 budget phone and being amazed I can do
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.600]   everything I want to do with it that's going to be the difference for me is saying that
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.440]   would get me back into the $1000 phone market once it's really studly for 3d
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.480]   okay but I've never used it on my iPad Pro so I just point yeah apparently they're going to skip
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.120]   a 13 because that's the unlucky apple silicon and go according to german go straight to a 14
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:40.240]   well a 13 is a current one oh is a 13 the current one yeah oh I'm behind on my
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.000]   A's is 30 was confusing because the iPad Pro still has the 12 it didn't get that's what
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.680]   can be used when 11 got the 13 so the i for 12 not the 13 for the 11 oh my god
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.560]   and the thing that I hate the most I hate the most is say I can't say a 12x anymore because
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.440]   of apple's stupid naming I say a I say a 1210 which is really confusing some x's are actually
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.840]   some x's are 10 yeah I think apples got to come up with names now not you know yeah just as they do
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.120]   with Catalina and mohalyic so like the next one will be cyborg I mean like with these better names
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.160]   they need uh and they can't call it apple silicon they have to call it something they gotta come
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.440]   up but they're gonna do that right you gotta do branding the chip cores are firestorm and ice
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.960]   storm this year apparently which sounds like superheroes to me that's too inshale baseball
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.400]   yeah and that's also very intellia I don't we have a nice late superheroes
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:39.120]   storm all right some apple employees testing the new devices according to german think that the
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.000]   new 6.7 inch screen is one of this year's most notable improvements you don't say it sounds like
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.760]   a well-apparsened it's like okay a few of the tests ladies and gents testing the screens believe
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:58.000]   it's notable notable apple plans to ship the lower end phones again this is still rumor well
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:05.360]   uh but it's german now we're on the we're on the tiramisu of rumors he's in the 80s he's in the 80s
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.760]   but not the top he's not ester like love to dream in the infirmary but also they do much fewer
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.280]   rumors so they've had less opportunity it doesn't look like it's a very sophisticated system and
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:20.080]   we haven't employed at all yet you have a giant i feel like you might have a whole wall
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:26.240]   with pictures of people in strings and uh but there's an app track website that uh apple track
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.640]   website that does all like it's a guy who runs the i update channel has an app so you're trusting
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.440]   his his assessments well he has links to everything and whether they're green means that they were
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:42.480]   true yellow means oh i wasn't wrong it wasn't wrong oh boy i'm sorry i i'm not going to trust
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.120]   any ranking method that doesn't rank their credibility in terms of numbers of habanero peppers
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:56.080]   like if he's like he's that's hot spicy rumor spicy what's his website i think it's apple
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:04.480]   track apple track apple track dot org maybe yeah apple track dot org yeah so this so you think this
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:13.040]   guy is the guy to follow well i just think it's falling off this mark german 86.7 accurate but he's
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.640]   got 309 rumors that's the thing yeah that's the difference you know he's only been wrong on on
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:26.320]   maybe you know one in ten that's not that's not bad um okay so he does that's cool actually that he
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.800]   does this is a very unflattering picture mark by the way uh i don't think is this a guy leaking
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.080]   to mark is that what this is is that is that Tim apple it looks like Tim apple but it's not that's
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.880]   funny you know my fair is it does show that he does keep his nose hairs very nicely green
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.960]   usual for for journalists would be so upset we're mark really that's the picture you use
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.000]   a menu at the right and if you go to the menu on the right there's a tier list um oh the the
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.640]   hamburger menu on the right source leaderboard number one is coin x 95.2 i the information 90
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.080]   percent good for you information but they all have way less way less love to dream 89 i'm going
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.320]   with german i'm with german on this one so let's go back to german. But boy you'll be
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.960]   happy to know that mink she quo is not like be teary oh really where is mink she quo let's see
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.760]   process only number six the wall street journals number seven i would have thought they'd be
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.560]   perfect since they get their sources you know frayed straight from the horse's mouth then mink
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:37.200]   she quo nine to five max since Walt Mossberg left Leo. Oh mako Takara mac rumors sunny dixon
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.520]   is only 62 digitized you missed the iMac at mackerel that's right at wc that's fair yeah
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.800]   bark lays the verifier max wine back and then we're really down in the bottom the most rumors
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   though by far almost two to one far mark german yeah so you know he shoots he scores 80 percent
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.440]   that ain't bad i'll take it yeah and he's at bat every day and he's at bat every day
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.400]   did i just mix my sports metaphor i'm yes you did i don't sports ball well the so they're saying the
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:15.600]   the lesser phones will ship a couple of weeks later sooner than the the okay so this so
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.880]   apple during a conference call apple said the new phones would ship a few weeks later than last
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.440]   year's models they started shipping september 20th so we might be as much as six weeks away from the
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:34.320]   new iphone arrival which means there's going to be a one month gap between your apple tv plus
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.920]   expiration and the next but it's any device leo doesn't have to be an i-phone okay you can be any
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.960]   apple device to be on it apparently you can't get two years of trial you got to get a new apple
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:51.040]   i was gonna say is that unless they change that which they probably will honestly because 2020
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:58.640]   was garbage it doesn't matter when your new phone comes in you don't get a new free trial like the
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.440]   trial ends the trial and i don't see apple doing anything that admits that 2020 was garbage
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.200]   it was it wasn't the pro it shows the difference between their strategy and others
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.800]   with disney because they're so voracious they have so many libraries that they are an entity in
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.160]   of itself netflix's idea is that we're going to be as eclectic as possible because we're going to
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.920]   have highbrow stuff we're also going to have the tiger king and therefore there's no chance there's
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.840]   no chance that there isn't anything on there that's going to interest you at some point but they have
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.640]   catalog which is the key apple has zero catalog right right but but apple is also
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.800]   an apple is an apple isn't buying i'm sorry i'm just gonna say that apple apple apple is
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.080]   apple is going towards sort of a hybrid of what hbo max is doing which is saying that we are going
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.360]   to fund and develop series and we're also going to buy some movies but chiefly we're going to be
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.320]   we're a production house that that contributes our own material a prestige production house they
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:01.520]   would never do tiger yeah so imagine applesburg and a tiger king
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:08.720]   the okay the new apple watch lineup i got there's so many i got to go through these here come on
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:16.640]   come on come on come on man we are on bigoted so watch the blood oxygen level monitor yeah
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:23.040]   that's the big the big one by the way with the new iphone shipping in october or later
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.040]   don't the ios 14 update will still come out this month they said people said some people we don't
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.760]   know who the people familiar with matters people familiar with people people the new apple watch
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.480]   lineup uh successor to the series five is this going to be every year from now on now i have to
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.320]   buy a new watch every then yeah that's you don't have to but it has been you have all the limiter is
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.920]   interesting especially in a year with covid i don't know if they'll actually address that or if it'll
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:52.400]   just be oxygen levels for sleeping and for for workouts but it there and i think samson is doing
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.920]   this too but i was unclear to me how much approval they've gotten internet samson's
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.640]   yet samson's uh had a three new features that were topping the apple watch but only one of which
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.400]   had been approved by the fda and that's the problem and that's it would be apples problem too although
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.520]   i would imagine nowadays with the fda just give them a few bucks they'll prove anything so
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:21.520]   uh the smaller home pod is coming oh wait a minute there'll be a successor to the series five but
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.000]   also replacement for the series three remember the series four for some reason they'll be
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.440]   replacement for the series three that will be so low cost it'll compete with the fit bit
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:36.080]   now to the home pod a smaller home pod because the big one oh it's important to say it rightly oh
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:45.840]   it's smaller it's a small home pod home pod small room uh fewer speakers inside the device uh but
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:52.800]   it won't cost 300 bucks i don't think really the issue with the home pod is size or even price it's
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:21:00.240]   functionality it doesn't do anything swole versus small swole no i i just i disagree i think that
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.680]   one of the reasons why amazon and google have had so much success and apple is not is that
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.040]   they they they they'll cover everybody i mean i've i have i have one google speaker that is
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.240]   be a big and beautiful as i've the google home max which is uh in a pair as a matter of fact in my
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.840]   bedroom that is my bedroom stereo and it's big and beautiful meanwhile for like places where i just
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.960]   want to make sure that i can get reminders and stuff he said unplugging his oh nice there you go
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:31.680]   i even have and i've got a google home mini uh in a couple different places like here because i don't
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.000]   want to have to yell across the room like my assistant becca's and the isn't isn't her little office
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.840]   outside uh and this is a lot this is the this is the gateway drug the fact that every black
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.960]   friday it's almost impot go ahead and try not to wind up getting a free one of these either from
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.480]   your electric your power company your broadband company because you bought a case of aftershave
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   i've actually and i've actually decided to go all google i'm gonna i was it was a i was an echo i
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.440]   have one home pod which the only functionality as far as i can tell is if you hit it on the head
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.160]   it'll start playing music and so if you hit it on the head it'll stop that's important if you
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:13.200]   don't have it on the head it'll stop or and you could say stop listening because for some reason
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.240]   every time i watch tv she gets involved and i don't really want her to get involved so you can make
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.000]   it a male voice so that he gets involved he gets involved in that's a couple yeah no i have a south
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.600]   african male voice because i like to think of you rene whenever uh thank you you're from syri uh
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:35.120]   so me and so but just as your point andi i think the battle is between amazon and google and i feel
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:42.400]   like google's pulling ahead i've i've now got the home the google home hub next max doohickey the big
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   screen doohickey on my desk you can do google meetings with it it tells you your calendar you
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.200]   can say to it play music on the stereo if you want because i have a shield attached to the stereo
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.640]   uh i mean i just it's it's functionality is expanded expanded the only thing i can't do is audio
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.480]   books from audible and buy things on amazon both of which i could probably just keep an echo around
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.600]   for that stuff so literally just just today i i activated there's new google celebrity
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:16.000]   get what they call it the new voice celebrity celebrity voice uh and i can't remember i can't
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   remember i had john legend beautiful voice hi john legend for a while then he says well that's it
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.960]   for me by and he's gone he bifurly should you want to google yeah he's gone he said
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   ace array ace array has been around for a while i i've had his well i just i just well i just found
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   her book on my phone today yeah and so and i can't it sounds like i'm making i'm making light of this
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.600]   but when you have such a beautiful personable voice that is oh i love it yeah and it gets you it
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:51.440]   really gets you wanting to use this service more i i was actually all today i don't always say thank
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.640]   you after like doing a doing a voice request but i now i'm all today i'm saying thank you thank you
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.880]   thank you thank you so much thank you so much i do that all the time it's so much nice yeah it's
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.560]   very Canadian nice yeah the quality the quality of that voice compared to i mean the the syru team
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:12.880]   is topnotch they're doing wonderful stuff but the i i do feel as though i want to interact with the
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.960]   google assistant a lot more than i want to interact with these other assistants and a lot of it is
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.520]   just simply because i know that i'm not talking to a robot it feels like it feels like someone
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.760]   understands but it's at least try hard to do what i ask it to do yeah maybe fail but try anyway
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.920]   apple social road bad news has been developing an apple tv box with a faster processor for better
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.560]   gaming after all we are now playing arcade games on our tv upgraded remote control that device
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.600]   goodness according to german might not ship until next year
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:51.840]   um and a new remote similar to find my iphone that would help you find the remote maybe i'm i'm
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.160]   wondering if air tags oh well wait a minute the company's other product development is called
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.040]   air tags designed for locating physical items which will be equipped with a leather carrying case
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:08.960]   okay so polish what if you lose the leather carrying case i don't even understand my my sense
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.600]   of air tags at this point is that it will just be in devices that is just going to be everywhere
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.520]   but i guess it'd be nice to attach it to my coffee cup or something in case people steal it
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:23.680]   slip it inside a wallet glue it and glue it to a bike yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so um any other
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:30.480]   rumors um oh we didn't do the ipad rumors what are the ipad rumors there's new ipads coming
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.960]   including an air touch id power buttons touch id power buttons that's good let's bring touch id
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.160]   back across the board shall we let's have multi-factor across the board so if i'm wearing a mask i guess
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.800]   the fingerprint if i'm wearing a glove i can use the face like just yes make it work for me i don't
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.080]   want to work for my security anymore i'm getting old and lazy do you think that'll happen is that
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.960]   possible i think eventually i think like eventually we'll just have like that's my dream where it'll
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.800]   take a snippet of face whenever it sees you a snippet of voice whenever it hears you snippet
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.560]   of fingerprint whenever you touch the screen it'll know your gate when you're walking and it'll just
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.960]   notice you threshold so when you're over that threshold it's fine and if you fall under that it
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.120]   just challenges you and then you you show it your face or your thumb or whatever and it lets you in
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.280]   and that's totally doable now by the way totally and it will be much better for everything it'd be
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:23.680]   real strong authentication yeah i i read a paper five or six months ago that was saying that that
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.440]   promise that they have a model of simply collecting incidental things like again your gate things like
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.600]   where does your finger does your finger tap a button at the very very center or does it tend to
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:39.440]   drift to the edge how does your how does your your habits change over the course of a day and the
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.120]   the researchers behind this paper claimed that they could they were nearing the same accuracy as touch
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.200]   id just by simply saying we we we know this guy and we believe that the person who is operating this
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   phone is this guy yeah which is i'm not sure it would work as a layer one security but as a way of
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.520]   saying do we need to verify this person's idea right now is that no he's been using this phone
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.720]   for two or three hours and if if someone has been faking all the little ticks and stumbles that
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:13.440]   anti-nautical does they deserve the win yeah yep yep yep yep yep um any other rumors before we move
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.240]   on anything else i i left out i just i just think we didn't talk about the i i pet ear four
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.200]   which would be the rumors that the rumors that being reported are basically saying
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.640]   to me let's take everything that you all the reasons why you've been sort of thinking about
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.040]   spending a thousand dollars on a new ipad pro and bring them down to the less expensive ipad
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.680]   air like give me the smaller bezels give me the higher performance give me something that's giving
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.760]   you a little extra power that could be very very interesting this the the the ipad has always been
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.880]   apple's killer killer device in the sub thousand dollar market and if they can continue to deliver
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.840]   value uh in of era in which microsoft surface devices are doing well but they're not running
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.960]   away with it that could be really really great for for apple for us
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:04.880]   oh speaking of which mr loporta do you order a galaxy fold to a surface duo or yes i saw your
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   tweet and i was i was actually um i was actually gonna get the fold uh in fact i was
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.560]   gonna get the new samsung watch because it had those interesting features not available yet
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.840]   uh i was gonna get i was thinking about their being like earbuds and the fold are you gonna get
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.640]   the box that one that one box to roll them all i was thinking of the designer what is a mark
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:35.760]   thomas or whatever yeah tom brown box then i thought i knew the price would be high we now know it's
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.040]   thanks to the event this morning it's two thousand dollars and it'll be available
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:46.080]   september 18th but then microsoft does this duo and i'm going hey it's very much like that meme with
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.600]   a guy walking with his fold on his arm and the duo walks by and goes hey
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:56.560]   so i ordered this pause for a moment to like the duo is embargoed so no one's allowed to show
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.960]   you the software but at the same time a different team in microsoft puts them up in best buy and
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.280]   carriers fully functional twenty one can walk off the street and videotape it's just gotta piss
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.120]   mark his out all it all it all it all it all it all it all well the thing is you just have to risk
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.280]   coronavirus yeah yeah yeah go to a best buy oh sure i'm gonna touch this this thing with my hands yeah
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.520]   try again but those videos went up immediately yeah yeah exactly so mary joe folate has a duo but
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.520]   she's got that same embargo to september 10th i ordered it so i will get it september 10th
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:33.280]   honestly i was really worried about the janky folding screen there's a crease down it i just i
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.800]   don't think it will even though they put a thin layer of glass on it i don't think it's gonna feel
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:44.160]   like a real glass screen uh i just i could and then the duo even though it's gonna hinge in a bezel
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.200]   i think that's the right way to do it it's existing known technology and it by the way it's 500 bucks
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:55.600]   cheaper and it's existing known technology that i think will work better out of the box so i chose
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.840]   the duo i'm not going to get the fold but i encourage you to get the fold so that somebody has it
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:07.200]   i love what i love about the fold is that they really they really seem to be trying to move the
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.320]   move the ball forward uh we're asked we're asked a folding device i i think it's a great idea i think
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.360]   it's wonderful to have a tablet form factor that's pocketable and accessible but that's
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.800]   it's either a phone or it's a tablet two things that we've had before what i love about the duo
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.880]   what makes it so intriguing is that they really are coming up with a paradigm for dual screen
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:32.320]   separated by a hinge operations where they the implication of this email app is that if you open
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.640]   an email you still want to see all your email lists but you also want to open this up in detail
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:43.440]   over there or that or that like when we get when we get back to the the pandemic times
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.840]   by i've always when i've always wanted for a device like this is let me pair up the let me pair
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:56.080]   up the the Kindle book and my and my my right sharing app so that i can always keep an eye on where
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.000]   my car is while still like reading what i want to read on two different screens and the way that the
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.480]   way that they thought ahead and thought that what if we make this into an application group so that
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:09.360]   if Andy just simply taps this one defined group he will have uber on one side he will have Kindle on
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:15.440]   the other side or however he wants to pair up apps i like a lot of what i said i'm frustrated a
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.120]   little bit by by technology because we tend to see improvements on ideas we've already had
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.880]   and there are very few companies that seem to be saying well what if we correct what if we try
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.120]   something new where we really don't know whether this is going to work or fall on its fall on its
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   face even Microsoft i think in their messaging so far has been they've been quietly saying
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:41.600]   that this is definitely a first effort that they don't expect it to be a hit in the first year
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.360]   but the people who buy it and appreciate it and start to use it will feed into the second-generation
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.200]   product and it's certainly priced that way so what what is future buying you alluree doo or a
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:32:01.760]   fold because it's not apple i get no foldable phones i get no foldable you'll get a 12 so you'll
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:07.440]   get an iPhone 12 you know i will i will yeah that's my problem this is a terrible time of year
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.760]   and i just don't want to buy all that new stuff i don't really even feel a need for a new iPhone
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:17.120]   but i guess i'll have to have to you know i'm spending my money on weird stuff so the duo is one
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.920]   i just ordered this i don't know what this is going to be like it won't be out till November
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:30.080]   this is the remarkable two this is an e-ink oh yeah that's the size of a nope like a you know a
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:36.400]   notepad it has a stylus but it has so you it's like writing on paper but it also
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:42.880]   will go to the phone app and so forth and so on i don't i you can put books on it you can put you
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   know pdfs on it you can ill i think this is intriguing it's intriguing because it it runs it runs
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:56.160]   android 9 is it yeah yeah and so so that means you have access to the kendall app it means you
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.080]   have access to the full suite of apps it doesn't mean there have been other devices that are kind
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.400]   of like this but they kind of can only exist as a pdf reader an open e-pub the breeder and digital
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:12.960]   paper this one is just simply an android tablet that's based on e-ink and has a stylus but it has
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.440]   all the all the battery advantages and all the persistence of scribe display advantages i am
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:24.080]   let's see this is a dangerous time because i'm not spending money the way i typically do
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:28.960]   well i don't want to either i cannot have the money to spend either i'm not well see i'm no i'm
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:33.920]   i'm actually the opposite i'm saying that i don't travel to like boston like once or twice a week so
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.040]   that's thirty dollars oh yeah i'm not spending i'm not taking like business trips to new york and so
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:43.680]   that's not a bad thing to have savings i'm glad that i'm like being able to put some money away and
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.080]   save money but it means that like that little lizard eight-year-old the eight-year-old boy of
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.720]   myself saying but it's only four hundred dollars and look how much money that we have that we didn't
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.360]   think we'd have the force and and i have to again put on my hat so my interest my interest in this
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.600]   is that it's something different that's what that's i guess the point i was making is like the duo
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.000]   is full yeah i want to look at new form factors because we know these you know we know the slabs
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.720]   of glass we know the laptops right so is there something different the other thing i ordered
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:17.920]   which comes thursday is a linux phone the pine phone um i don't know what that's whether that
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:25.840]   it's i don't know what that's gonna be but i'll have it for a next next episode how many how many
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.320]   buttons of a number can you dial before it says it needs to download a new driver yeah it's gonna
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:38.400]   sorry i don't have the i don't have the the dynatics seven driver it's it's it's an open source uh phone
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.280]   you i can put my favorite uh linux on it manjaro it's not expensive it was 150 bucks uh it's the
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.960]   year of handtop linux we all know that handtop linux it has a lot of the features of you know
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.640]   like a phone from a few years ago and has physical switches too for the microphone and cameras and
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.960]   location so that's kind of cool i don't know we shall see oh the thing you know what i really
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.120]   liked about it it uses a sa a replaceable samsung j7 battery yeah which i have a lot of
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:15.280]   if i haven't gotten rid of them i'll have to look so that means it's i miss that and the old samsung
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.240]   funds you open the back put a battery in put it in you got it good to go for another day so we shall
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.120]   see we shall see i'm i'm curious to hear you to talk about like what battery management is like on
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.840]   that device yeah because i've every managed major manufacturer they're they benefit from a larger
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.800]   battery but mostly they get most of their battery life out of just really really efficient ai
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:40.800]   drive battery life yeah yeah this is this is probably not very tweaked uh it only has two gigs of ram
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.240]   which is going to be an issue i don't know i just don't know five megapixel camera yeah
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.360]   yeah it's probably going to be one of those yeah but we'll see we will we will learn a lot by having
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.680]   these in the hands of people who know how to exploit it yeah and i am i'm a linux fanatic so um yep
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.680]   i will be uh i will be intrigued and in 150 bucks so that's that's kind i mean i guess
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:12.080]   well you know michael will have to get the new ipad and Jason has already got the note 20 and
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.320]   i'll let them get the you know the traditional stuff but i'm kind of more interested now in
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:23.440]   what the future uh holds let's take a little break come back with more our show today brought to you
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:29.760]   by extra hop which sounds like a cute little bunny well it kind of is but instead of hopping around
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.360]   your backyard extra hop hops around the network to tell you how your performance is and how
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:45.440]   your security is extra hop is the you know the new it reality is remote access on a massive scale
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:52.320]   right we're matt rapid cloud and multi cloud adoption a steady increase in iot devices all on top of
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.520]   what a rise in cybercrime that's not good more important than ever organizations can see
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.720]   everything going on in their environment all the way from the cloud to the data center to the
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.600]   customer but in order to protect and scale your business you need more than unified visibility
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:14.000]   you need context so that when you get a detection you have it you there's some you have an intelligent
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.640]   response so you can act fast that's really important and you can collaborate that's what extra hop
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:28.320]   does it helps businesses stop breaches 70 percent faster extra hop eliminates blind spots and detects
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:34.240]   threats other tools miss to keep your business secure and available with sass based cloud native
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.960]   network detection and response and it's used by some of the biggest companies in the world some of
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.320]   the smallest two because it's a really affordable really useful tool which is the coast you know
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.360]   them from magic the gathering they use extra hops to secure and support their AWS cloud
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.760]   we talked to Dan McDaniel he's chief architect and CISO at Wizards of the Coast he said quote
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:02.160]   there's no other company that aligns to supporting the dev ops model the speed and the lack of friction
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:09.360]   than extra hop maybe you've seen those alta beauty stores in your local small they use extra hop to
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.760]   secure their google cloud as well as keeping network and security teams closely aligned
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.520]   so that their engineers can have more time to focus on innovation senior it engineer at
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.800]   alta says john crease says before extra hop we had limited visibility into what was going on in the
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   cloud but now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits and understand how our applications
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:37.040]   are performing in the cloud you see that that visualization there at the website go take control
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.720]   of your cloud security with extra hop if you go to extra hop dot com slash to it right now
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.400]   you can learn more about how extra hop stops breaches 70 percent faster and you can use their
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:52.240]   free trial and once you see this dashboard and the information you have to at your fingertips
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:58.000]   about what's going on in your network on the cloud on customers networks all the way down
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:07.120]   from you to them you will say i have to have this thing extra hop dot com slash to it extra hop
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:14.000]   dot com slash to it this is a really useful tool for anybody who's managing clouds networks
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:24.320]   customers and so forth extra hop dot com slash to it well it's my thought that this was something
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:33.920]   apple said it was going to do but uh some people seem surprised by this um ios 13.7 will enable app
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:42.160]   free coven 19 exposure notifications it's been in behind the scenes on ios 13 for some months now
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:50.320]   but now but nobody not many people adopted it we've also seen sadly uh coven 19 track trackers
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:56.320]   that have all sorts of privacy and security issues we know that apple and also we have
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.800]   canada's like they did it but canada set one up and kebex said no we opt out it's still we don't
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.360]   like it so i i have the app and it doesn't working it tells me if there's been a thing you know
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.960]   it were they're just not collecting the data from it well that's not as useful it's good to tell me
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.960]   that there's been content but it's not doing anything to help greater than me which is so
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.400]   depressing so when they first released it uh you would see in the settings we showed this but
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.840]   there was nothing you could do until you had an app installed yeah now uh it's in the developer
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:34.640]   beta but that means probably it will be coming soon to ios 13 uh users can opt in in the phone
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.760]   without downloading a public health systems app so you'll be able to get updates on the fact that
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.840]   you might have been exposed i think that's something people would want to know it requires that everybody
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:50.960]   else be running the app on ios or android right uh you will recent version yes the latest right
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:56.240]   users will still need to confirm their own positive diagnoses using locally offered apps so if you
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.520]   get diagnosed and you don't have an app the phone won't know so you won't get it sounds like it's
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.800]   gonna be a tiny fraction of people it's just gonna work with right yeah like like masks it could
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.000]   solve immense problems if everybody opted into it but no not unfortunately not everyone's gonna
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.120]   be opting into it so it's probably not gonna be very useful at least not in the united states
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:27.360]   lori so i think what apple and and google are doing is trying to make the whole thing easier so
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:32.480]   you don't have to download an app is kind of the key here so in some states and in some countries
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   they've developed apps specifically that you download you put on your phone you do this you do that
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:46.400]   so in this case it would be as long as your government has you know done there the thing that
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:54.160]   they do to you know trigger the notification situation um you can just opt in you don't have to
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.360]   you know download and stall sign up for anything like that it's just kind of in the operating system
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:06.080]   there so it's it's really what i think it's more about whether or not governments are going to
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:14.800]   do this as opposed to creating their own version of an app that that uses their own kind of tracking
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:23.840]   so and and though uh contact tracing is is certainly that doesn't stop you know the spread and it's it
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:30.400]   does require people to actually use it what i think it does do is help send messages out and
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:37.360]   get notifications out quicker than what it could have been without so even if only 30 percent of
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:46.080]   the population is using contact tracing on their phones that's 30 more chance of people finding
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.560]   out that they've been exposed to it and then self isolating as soon as they as soon as they find
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:55.200]   out about it instead of flat the curve without a hundred yeah you can flatten the curve without
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.880]   a hundred percent adoption for sure there's another problem which is at least in the u.s. we're backing
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.720]   down on testing we're doing less testing the cdc recommending that we not test people who are
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:14.880]   asymptomatic so it's it's like if you don't have tests no one adopts the app no one uses the app
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:22.560]   it doesn't matter how great this is um apparently some college campuses are starting to use this
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:28.160]   matt rictal had an article in the new york sony times saying uh college has become labs for
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:34.400]   coronavirus tests and tracking apps there was a college in michigan that had an app but unfortunately
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.920]   it was hideously insecure in the so that that didn't work out so well that's why you really
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.600]   want to just let apple do it right the tolerance and competence of all of our administrators and
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:52.320]   and leaders is just yeah yeah yeah well that's the problem and you know and also i can't
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.280]   say it's entirely leadership because uh americans are bloody-minded we don't
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.320]   well very independent the british are supposed to be blooded bloody-minded i know i would
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.600]   we all point to get away from that and we took the cake for that uh we with the nation the nation
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:14.080]   was founded by and kind of has always supported rugged individualism and that means we don't like
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:18.400]   to wear matt lots of us not all of us but don't like i wear masks but a lot of us don't want to wear
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.400]   masks when vaccines are available i guarantee you a significant proportion of the population will
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:31.040]   say i'm not doing a vaccine um contact tracing people i mean i remember georgia dao said i'm never
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:39.760]   going to put that app on my phone um yeah well can i i will i will only say that there's an
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.960]   environment right now where people are not just not wearing masks they are assaulting people who
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.920]   are wearing masks and they're insulting people who on private property ask them to wear masks
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.080]   according to the policy that's been posted to the store i think that's a small number of reasons
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:00.160]   we hear a lot about it i'm saying i'm i'm saying that the reason why this exists is because leadership
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:06.480]   in this country has intentionally fostered an environment in which we are supposed to doubt
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.040]   that coronavirus is actually a thing and that any of the things that have been proven to mitigate
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:16.000]   it are actually effective so it's probably the case if we had strong leadership more people would do it
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.280]   but i still know there there's a strong there would be a realistic trend in this country it would be
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.760]   a challenge but that's that i don't think that we be in this situation there's all i'm going to say
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:31.280]   that this is this is a situation which i have to say is what i want to say and that's that there's
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.880]   at some point historians are going to tally up a body count and assign it to an individual and
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:44.800]   well everybody knows it's Joe Biden's fault right so that's so it's so so Andy though i do agree with
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:50.160]   you but actually the Spanish flu had a very similar situation where there were there were
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.360]   thousands and thousands of people who didn't want to wear masks and almost identical to what had
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:02.560]   happened in the u.s. everybody more or less most people more or less were on board at first and then
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:09.440]   they the the country decided to open back up and people didn't want to do it once they were
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.800]   kind of given their freedom back if you want to use those terms so it's it's almost identical
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.680]   to the way the Spanish flu happened yeah we're seeing it again and it has not it doesn't have
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.280]   as much to do with the leadership of the country as you might think i guess is what i'm getting at.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:34.480]   it's our national character by the way the anti-mask league of san francisco dates back to 1918 and
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.480]   the as you said the flu back you would think that we would have learned like the whole promise of
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.480]   the inter the information age and the internet was that we would we would excel we would rise
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.120]   above we would transcend we'd become better and smarter and faster and stronger and we've proven
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.200]   that we will now not believe in the pandemic but believe in q and on that's basically what the
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:58.080]   internet is given. San francisco board of health passed a law requiring masks which was annulled
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.200]   November 21st 1918 because people were damn tired of wearing masks.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:09.520]   calculator is back. well that's those are those are excellent points i mean that's sincerely
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:17.040]   however we have a situation what we have today is different from 1918 in that we have the 1918
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.240]   pandemic to learn from then we and we just learned from there's their their pro well their programs
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.680]   that were put into place as a result of once once the data analysis was complete and realizing
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:32.240]   exactly the nature of this the nature of that disease all the different deaths that could have
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.720]   been avoided or at least the spread contained and also we have community we have communications
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.920]   systems and documentation systems that we and technology we didn't have back then although it
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:52.880]   is ironic that the number one uh amelioration is to wear masks something we knew and did in 1918
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.600]   so we had that technology for a hundred two years and by the way they say that they say that because
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:06.640]   of 80 compliance in san francisco wearing masks it's attributed to the decline in deaths in san francisco
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:14.960]   from influenza but like i said in november they revoked that regulation deaths went up dramatically
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:20.000]   and they and they reinstated it in january kebek is going back up again because they did like we
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.600]   were the we were the hardest hit in canada one of the hardest hit places in one of hardest places
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.680]   period but we were the first to open up the first to allow gatherings of 250 people
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.160]   sending kids back to school they're refusing to tell us now what the numbers in schools are
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:38.400]   and now they're saying hunker down there might be a second wave really here's a here's a picture
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:45.600]   uh from 1918 of a cable car conductor not letting this guy on because he's not wearing a mask
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.680]   he shouldn't let the other guy on because he's wearing his mask wrong as people have done for
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:56.320]   a hundred years they're all fine with wearing their wearing hats and jackets and thank god i
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.680]   think we should bring hats back that's for sure you have no authority over me mr bus conductor
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.760]   i also think that the number of people we you know we see a lot of video and stuff people
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.560]   refusing to wear masks my daughter works at uh... trader joe's she is not yet running to somebody
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.800]   who wouldn't wear a mask it's the rule that you can't come into the store without a mask and and
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.000]   as yet and she's been there three or four months there's never no not one person she got a little
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.720]   fight with one woman who wanted to put her handbag on the conveyor belt for checking out the groceries
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.480]   the man woman got mad she said but that woman's doing it she said well it's wrong you can't do it
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.920]   uh... but that was it so i i think people
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:41.680]   i i i think most people want to do the right thing i hope they do otherwise we'll beat this but this
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.640]   is going to go on for a long time no again yeah uh... tim cook is uh... selling some of his apple
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:54.560]   stock he's a billionaire now officially by the way apple had another great run up uh... over the last
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:00.720]   uh... few days tim was recently awarded more than half a million shares of apple stock for serving
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:03.760]   as ceo and for doing a good job
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.280]   he sold half of those two hundred sixty five thousand
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:11.360]   uh... at prices ranging from four hundred ninety three to five hundred dollars
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:16.960]   netting around a hundred thirty million dollars he probably wanted to buy a boat i don't blame him
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.200]   i would
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.640]   you know to get away from here get away from here get on the boat
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:27.680]   uh... i don't know what he you know he's given the money to uh... his uh... nephew right that was
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.120]   some of it in a rest goes to charity yeah isn't that great
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.720]   this is this nephew's going to be going to a hell of a good school
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:39.680]   uh... he might even be able to buy half his books he could buy hoff it
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:45.360]   uh... you can afford their online courses at least by the way elon musk
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:53.440]   is now uh... what is it richer than uh... richer than um uh apple i think as tesla
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.200]   as a stock split as well as apple
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.080]   one of them cook was an offender right like so like the founders always had a huge
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.240]   yeah yes
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:06.000]   uh... d_c_ metro you can now use apple pay
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.960]   with your uh... metro card
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.360]   i think that's really cool
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.840]   i don't know if that means you can touch to pay
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:21.440]   uh... no you have to add to your fair card oh you can add your fair card to the apple wall and then
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.760]   hold hold your phone or apple watch near the payment reader in the metro rail stations or in
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.280]   the metro buses that's nice
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:33.920]   i am i am wondering what this uh... uh... tap to pay uh... in new york and other cities is going to do
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.360]   to revenue because uh... there's a certain non-zero amount of money that frisces new york makes
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.640]   by virtue of the fact that i uh... i'll i'm always in a case of like putting twenty dollars on but
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:50.160]   always having a dollar thirty four five that i can't somehow access because of the way that
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.920]   multiple values work and the and the idea of now and i also want to see that the numbers on uh...
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:00.560]   how much money is being like basically kept because of all the value that's been put on to
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.120]   metro cards that is now expired because people are not because time passes and people are going to be
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.480]   using them i bet there's a map there's probably a lot of that right like pennies on the dollar that
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:16.400]   just don't get used there's probably a lot of that yeah you don't know it because i'm so
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:25.360]   clever but i've been refreshing tech meme every three minutes because we're waiting to hear apparently
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:30.960]   tick-tock may the announcement that tick-tocks been sold to a u_s company may happen any day now
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.280]   any moment now sometimes oh wasn't china blocking it that was the last we heard no no china's not
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:41.280]   blocking the sale they just whoever buys it won't get any of the good stuff yeah china's blocking the
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:48.640]   intellectual property the ai from being transferred uh... but apparently uh... is
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.160]   microsoft will be as good as instagram reels is a microsoft oracle wal-mart coalition
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:01.280]   of the willing will be uh... will be uh... apparently a quite announced sometime soon that's
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:06.960]   i i as i said i keep refreshing it with all with my luck it'll be immediately after we get off the
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:11.200]   air uh... but i'm keeping an eye on that well you and steve can talk about
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.760]   yeah there's no there's no real security it'll be thrilled yeah
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:22.960]   um police did a rest one more teen in the twitter hack another 16 year old
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:31.360]   those 16 year olds man he appears to have played a significant role in the july 15th twitter takeover
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.800]   the he's from canada kit or no massachusetts on tuesday federal agents served the teenager
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.160]   with a search warrant and scoured his massachusetts home where he lives with his parents who are
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:54.320]   might be least surprised uh... that's like a movie jimmy's not a bad boy what did you do billy
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:54:03.440]   okay they didn't arrest him um i i have to say that this that this fellow who's been accused of
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:09.120]   being the mastermind of the attack he really did double down on having on posing in mastermind mode
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:14.560]   for his mugshot i know i don't want to show it because he's underage and unlike every other
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.720]   journalist in the world i don't like to mention his name or show his picture but i guess i'm just
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:28.160]   old fashioned yeah yeah that thing yeah wal-mart plus now a deal launches september 15th
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.560]   98 dollars a year same day unlimited same day delivery for free fuel discounts and more
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:43.760]   uh wal-mart plus competing with of course amazon prime uh i think next on the program
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:51.600]   it's time for your picks of the week and just wonderful he's look foreign to it did you read
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:55:00.320]   the scottish wikipedia story yeah that was great oh my god the kid who apparently is
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.720]   an american teenager who doesn't know scott's but does know the robin william's impression of a scott
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:15.040]   Smith it's so wrote 22 000 wikipedia articles in the scottish wikipedia in a fake schokshak
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:22.240]   that's a lot of time free time to be doing something like that exactly if i if i were his mom or dad
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.720]   i'd say well if you have time to write 22 000 malicious articles you have time to mow that long
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:32.480]   young mister yeah all right let's kick off our picks of the week i'm going to let lory start
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:41.040]   because i haven't hurt my wallet yet today well so over the weekend with some friends and i got
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:48.880]   together and we played trivial pursuit the horror edition so for fans of horror movies and horror
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:56.400]   tv shows trivial pursuit has an official horror game that just came out it just released i think
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:06.880]   two weeks ago maybe so it's brand new and it's pretty fun so my my shorthand review of it i found
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:13.680]   that there's a lot of tv show oh um questions and i am not very familiar like Dexter was one of the
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.480]   tv shows that's fair there's a lot of questions about that and i've never seen the tv show Dexter
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.600]   so um that's like i it makes me think okay i need to get out there and watch more horror tv so that
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:31.920]   i can get my get my uh chop stone but you feel like i do when they do geography questions on jeopardy
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:39.280]   like i'm not prepared for this yeah yeah there's like a uh sir but unfortunately it's not like
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.480]   you know the orange is the tv one it's tv questions like throughout all of the different categories so
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.120]   it doesn't matter which category you pick you might end up with one of the tv questions so it's
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:54.560]   kind of hard to like fit you know like you really do have to like bone up on your on your movies
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:03.760]   and uh i consider myself like a a pretty good horror fan and i found about 50 to 70 of the questions
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.040]   were actually like harder than i thought they would be because they're very detailed like the name of
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.800]   some person who um was you know just had two lines in a movie or something like that it's not your
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.680]   typical trivia like who directed you know Halloween or something like that they get deeper in the
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.600]   in the weeds with it but it's really fun i'd be terrible at this because my eyes are closed the
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:32.880]   whole time i wouldn't know any answers the categories include gore and disturbing psychological killer
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:41.840]   monster paranormal and comedy and uh they've even got horror themed movers including monster hand
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:50.800]   doll head i'd buy it just for this straight jacket goat head cleaver in brain and table saw which
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:58:00.720]   did you choose i chose the uh goat head goat head wow i love the hand print on the front yeah it's
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.520]   fun Lisa would be so good at this because she loves horror and i'm not kidding when i say i
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:12.320]   i wouldn't know i've i close my eyes i terrify oh look at these horrible tokens oh my god they're
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:18.800]   so cute oh look at that cute baby doll head i would buy it just for the tokens and never use it that's
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.920]   awesome oh are they are they big these tokens uh no they're they're uh an inch and a half maybe
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:32.480]   yeah they're not that big all right here's one what company did damey and run as an adult in
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:39.680]   omen 3 the final conflict 1980 see that i've never seen omen 3 if you ask me a question about the
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:46.800]   first omen 1 the greatest omen ever the weeds there yeah yeah tour falls the first five godzilla
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:53.600]   films were filmed in black and white false really i think so i believe that only the first two
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:58.400]   yeah that this first and second one yeah and then they went to color by the way it was the thorn
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:04.800]   corporation in the case before he filmed middle earth epics what that's kind of a giveaway you
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:09.760]   could stop right there if i were playing jeopardy i pressed the button right there what director rose
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:16.880]   to fame with gore fests like bad taste and dead alive yeah i killed and i now i can't remember his
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.720]   name right now which happens to me all the time i get on the spot that's called age with his name
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:24.320]   with his name but you're not old enough for that to be i just answer score sacy for everything no
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.880]   it's better judge you could just as soon as you say he before he filmed the middle earth epics you
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:35.600]   could stop right you know right away yeah who played i remember this one who played twin gynecologists
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:43.520]   and david cronenberg's dead ringer's wow is that jeremy irons yes very good oh good yeah yeah what
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:51.920]   camp did win today and pugs pugsly adam's attend against their will in the adam's family values i
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:57.600]   know i you know i and i've seen that movie but it's one of those things that like i don't know i would
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.680]   have had to watch that movie ten times to know that and that's not one of the many i've watched
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:06.400]   it's on for it right yeah you can dance how you want to dance live how you want to live camp
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:13.600]   chippewa chippewa that's not scary no that's a good pick though but i'm not going to buy it because
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:19.680]   i don't like to lose it trivial pursuit i like to win and you would lose it that way i would really
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:25.200]   lose at least it kill me on this yeah it is it is really a beautiful set though i really like how they
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:32.880]   they made it horrific you know yeah oh man all right you know what maybe i'll get this for lisa
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.720]   oh yeah yeah but i won't play it but then she'll make you play it with her oh yeah crap and then you'll
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:47.840]   lose at trivial pursuit never i won't you can't lose if you don't play and he and i go you're picking
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.680]   you're picking the week um i wind up talking a lot about classical music and opera so of course
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.480]   this is going to be another one of those weeks i just signed up for prime fun which is a
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.920]   new subject excuse me not new but it's been around for a year or so i love it
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.440]   music service specifically for classical music it addresses all the problems of listening to
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:13.360]   classical music on other streaming services because it's the the way that classical music is
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.760]   categorized the way that it's cataloged the way that one performer can be related to a whole
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:24.240]   bunch of other performers and other works makes it really really difficult to fit in the mold of
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:29.840]   you know us uh a streaming service that was meant to meant to just reflect the Beatles
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:35.040]   here are the 11 albums from the Beatles here's the who the albums from the who this one with the
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.560]   not only it's not so much the catalog that this classical music service pass although they do
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:45.360]   have a lot of like obscure stuff from independent labels that you won't find on the main services
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:51.440]   it really is all about hey i've just i've just seen uh i've just seen left raviata on
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.000]   meta-oper streaming there's their free streaming last week and i'm really interested in this diana
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.280]   domrau uh but are you interested in verity operas or your student diana domrau it'll tell you that
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.800]   diana domrau often performs with these five six seven different performers uh when you when you
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.520]   when you go and you look for a version of la traviata uh it will help you explore to see which
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.440]   version you kind of are gonna like uh and of course there are podcasts that are custom
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:21.840]   playlists that are very well done they bring on board a lot of uh uh uh curators and brand
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.280]   ambassadors from the world of vopra uh and from the world of classical music what the the idea is
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.240]   not so much that if you are like an egghead who's a master of classical music this will finally
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:38.800]   satisfy your very refined taste for music service it's more for people like me where i i know there's
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.520]   a lot of music in that collection that i like but it's hard to navigate and hard to find largely
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:51.440]   because again is this again is this opera is it a verity is it a verity album is it a a
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:57.360]   metropolitan opera album is it a it just really i i was really i was pretty i was pretty amazed by
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:02.720]   how quickly i was like favoriting and collecting so many different things like almost like bokeh
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.480]   mongo like in the first hour because this the discovery of of content through this app is so
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.200]   much better than uh than through any other music app i mean if there if there were a version of
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:18.400]   this for rock a version of this for jazz i really think that that would be optimal for people who
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.600]   really want to get into and explore everything that's about a certain music genre uh the cool
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:28.560]   thing is that they have a couple different pricing plans it's ten bucks a month uh for normal service
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.160]   for fifteen dollars a month it'll stream and hd so it'll give you like cd quality or better sound
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:39.600]   and also you got a two-week trial without having to leave a credit card and the other good thing is
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.880]   that i recommended this uh online someplace else and someone who rited me that hey do you do a google
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:50.800]   search for uh for prime fonic discount codes because they're giving away like half off your first nine
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:55.360]   months or your first year or whatever uh that you can find them really good but yeah so i've got i've
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:01.200]   got nine days left excuse me no i'm sorry that was i've got a few days left and i'm definitely
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:07.360]   signing up for it because what i want from a music service is not a service that helps me too that
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.160]   kind of tries to bamboozle me into listening to the music that the service is trying to market and
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.920]   promote which is this this situation that i get with uh most of the mainstream music services
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.120]   this is a music service that lets me really explore and when i hear something when an idea
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.880]   occurs to me if something i'd like to explore gives me the tools to find the stuff that will
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:33.200]   let me discover music that i didn't didn't know of ten minutes ago but suddenly is one of my
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:39.760]   absolute favorites i not only a second your nomination i'm a year member in the fifteen dollar plan because
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:46.720]   i really love the high quality streaming and uh yeah they have some the podcast is fantastic for
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.680]   introducing you classical music highly recommend the podcast they also have really interesting
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:58.880]   curated playlists like Mozart in a minor key i mean you don't really think of Mozart's minor key
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:05.920]   masterpieces but they're really fun or uh the lighter side of Wagner i hit there it goes it's
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:12.720]   really fun uh and i love classical music i also love kind of obscure medieval music and early
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.600]   classical like joscan to pray and it's hard to find that on youtube music because he didn't make
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:23.360]   a lot of videos uh so it's nice that you can have somewhere where you can get that kind of music
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:29.200]   somebody told me and i was just about to see if i could verify this that they now offer this on
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.880]   sonos is one of their um uh music systems because they didn't for a long time and that was i thought
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:41.200]   a negative but uh it's it's still great i don't know but the only downsides for apps is that uh it's
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.880]   available for ios available for android they have a web player they don't have an apple tv or android
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:53.600]   tv or roku player uh but right okay it'll it'll stream out uh but yeah that's i mean that's exactly
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.080]   it's it's funny you should mention uh spotify and others because the reason why i found it was
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:02.800]   because or excuse me the reason why it's so funny that you mentioned youtube music because i've
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:08.320]   absolutely so officially disgusted with how horrible youtube music is that it was like okay
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:12.160]   there's no way in hell i'm going to be listening to this and using this in any way shape or form
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:17.680]   it's time for me to decide whether i want to use uh buy a new account on spotify or switch over to
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.560]   apple music for like my streaming music and in the course of like looking for different points of
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:27.840]   view i found prime fonic and so now so now it cost me money because now i'm subscribing to both
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:34.640]   prime fonic ends and uh spotify i know because for pop music you still need the other so yeah kind of
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:38.800]   have to do both and and and to be fair there's not a whole i was surprised by there's not a whole
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:44.240]   lot of music that i couldn't find on spotify or apple music like one of my favorite mezzo's uh
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:51.200]   alice koot uh who is uh has international reputation but she hasn't done that sort of recording where
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.080]   you would find it like end-capped at barns and oval or whatever uh but they still have uh
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:07:01.200]   spotify still has most of her stuff the point is that they will have uh prime fonic has all of her
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:06.240]   stuff and if you've never heard of her before but you just you just came off of uh joysticked and
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:09.840]   not only your suddenly thing you wonder what other mezzo's appranos are out there it would make it
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.880]   very very easy to find the work of alice koot yeah they have a nice web player so that's usually how
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:19.840]   i uh listen is in the web player and that's by the way another reason why i'm moving to google for
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:27.440]   everything because uh it's you know i had i was sonos for so long and but sonos has really screwed
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:32.960]   the pooch and it turns out now everybody can do the multi-room party mode so you don't need so that
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:39.120]   was the only thing sonos did that was unique so now i use my google uh home devices to cast
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:43.840]   to my stereo which is you know good speakers or other good speakers in the house actually the
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.600]   google home max is a very good single speaker system and and i can uh listen to all my favorite
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:55.120]   music that way and party mode so and there's nothing like party mode with the lighter side of
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:02.240]   vlogger that is that's a party and a half the difference is that people die off stage
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:10.880]   they're just a few someone comes by and say no he'll go is dead ripped apart by egos i really enjoy
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:16.240]   they this is the musical surprises list and they have like ludwig says relax
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:22.800]   no way beyond greek voiceless pucini let's just see what's on the lighter side of vogner
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:28.320]   it's not that light uh but okay rule Britannia there you go their navel rung played entirely
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.040]   on slide whistles the american centennial march
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:44.000]   i did i really enjoyed the moats art in a minor key i thought that was really really great so
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.800]   they it's nice to go somewhere where you can really learn about um music classical music there's
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.760]   great classical music out there so this is i completely agree with you very very nice choice
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:58.480]   uh rene richie your pick of the week
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:05.520]   so um this is a youtube channel that i really really like because it's just way way smarter
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.880]   than i am it's jordan herrod who does everyday artificial intelligence and machine learning
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:17.760]   explainers so basically when apple says there's something like um scribble on an ipad or an apple
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:23.600]   watch or they explain how the technology works i can just say oh you know it uses machine learning
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.200]   but uh jordan is an expert in machine learning and she can go through and explain to you exactly how
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.760]   all of this is being done and she has a channel where she just keeps putting up
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:40.400]   really great videos that explain in-depth how ai and machine learning works which i find endlessly
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:46.080]   fascinating but also like the social implications of them like how deep fake technology works and
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:52.400]   and you know how our trust level for videos or the implicit bias in algorithms when you know you
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:56.960]   see facebook like how on earth could facebook ever supply that as a search prediction or how
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.760]   could google saying like when i searched for i wanted to see something on the marion is tranche
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:07.200]   once and i was del used with fake megalodon conspiracy theories for a month and just like trying to
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:15.200]   understand how that how all of that works and doesn't work or when people programming the algorithms
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:21.920]   end up uh influencing how the algorithms uh respond to all these things and it's just really in-depth
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:27.200]   really clear cut really easy to understand explorations of of the stuff which is literally
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.480]   eating the same way software ate the world machine learning is eating software so i really appreciate
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:37.360]   learning as much as i can about this stuff this really looks good i'd never heard of her and i
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:43.840]   will definitely she's terrific algorithms artificial intelligence and technology uh jordan herad wow
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:53.840]   every day but it's every d ai yeah that's great oh my god i have this is incredible
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:59.520]   look at all the stuff she covers this is where youtube is such an amazing resource
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:07.440]   but the problem is there's a i mean you know some of her is only have uh 400 500 views this is
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.800]   brilliant stuff yeah she's just starting with she's growing like she's growing really well and really
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:16.400]   well deserved good yeah definitely just you have a patreon
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:22.240]   she has don't know she's sponsored by brilliant which is great brilliant of brilliant to do that
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:26.960]   yes she does have a patreon it's every day and she's also a nebula with us which is doing a bunch of
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.680]   stuff for her oh is she a nebula oh great i'm nice that's how i first introduced to her too like i
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.960]   embarrassed me to know about it then i saw her pop up in the nebula chat and i was like wow this
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.000]   stuff is amazing yeah we need more people explaining this stuff because god knows i can't do it uh
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.160]   good pick wow we mentioned patrick wortle earlier because we were talking about his discovery of the
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:53.760]   uh of the uh signing problems with notarization and i should really once again i've done it before
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:12:02.080]   plug his site objective dash se objective dash c.com he is a security researcher at jamf but he gives
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:09.120]   away a ton of stuff i just installed one of his newest it's called block block this is a really good
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:15.920]   way to keep an eye on malware on your mac and tush it monitors common persistence locations
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:23.600]   and alerts you when something installs a persistent component like a a kernel code or an or a launch
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.520]   demon and that is a really useful tool because if malware is going to persist it's going to need
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.320]   to do that and if you get a warning every time something does that and you can say do i want to
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:42.800]   allow it that's huge i had mentioned before lulu which is his version of uh you know the outbound
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.840]   traffic detector what's the name of that old one that was really good but it was not free lulu is
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:54.320]   free in fact free and open source and i really like that patrick does have a patreon if you
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:13:00.160]   probably should support him if you use uh his apps because he doesn't charge for them knock knock
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:07.360]   lulu block block do not disturb he's got a ton of them he's clearly prolific and very talented do
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:13.360]   not disturb prevents evil made attacks knock knock sees what's persistently installed so it goes with
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.400]   block block you put knock knock on get rid of all the persistent threats and then put block block
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.840]   on to make sure no new ones are installed things like that uh just some really really great stuff
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:30.720]   um he's a national treasure for mac and tush users take advantage of it objective dash c
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:37.760]   s e e dot com we are uh at a time but fortunately we're also out of news so it worked out pretty
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:46.000]   well that way uh anti-annocco will be back on it w g b h boston win uh we are on tape mostly this

[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.120]   up for tomorrow where i tackle what can be done about the app store not not just in terms of what
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.440]   developers or customers or even apple wants but in terms of the largely technologically illiterate
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:34.880]   u.s congress and the recent statements they've made and what apple could do to maybe just
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.160]   avoid them taking a hammer to which should be a laser procedure i love it very good so i spoke
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.480]   to a ton of developers i spoke to a ton of not just people that's what that's his voice we need to
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.920]   hear i think what a developer they are all over the place like i had a lot of assumptions about what
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.320]   developers wanted and you know it ranged like it was like some of them are happy with the 30
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.400]   percent some of them are happy with uh would would be happy with it if apple actually fulfilled
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.400]   their promises on it some wanted to go down at 15 percent some just want apple payer the
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.560]   transaction one apple out of their business like the range of a pain some really want side
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.240]   loadings they can put any apple on others are terrified of the privacy implications right that
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:14.080]   governments could put things on their foot like but and i went through every single argument that
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.280]   i could find and the good and bad points to all of them excellent youtube.com/renaerichi
