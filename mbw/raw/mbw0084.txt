[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   As you would expect, given that it says it's called Weekly,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   we are spread out once again all over the United States.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Not the world this time, but the United States.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This is Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I'm once again in for Leo and from New York or Boston.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Sorry, Boston.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We have Andy and I go, Andy.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Hey, are there other?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm in Colorado.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   The altitude is 55,412 feet.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I have an under-clocked CPU wise mentally
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   because of the lack of oxygen.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So I have a little extra interesting this time.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Where are you in Colorado?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   University of Colorado at Boulder at the conference
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   on World Affairs, believe it or not.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I used to live in Boulder.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Later on, I'll tell you before I did it with last night,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and then you'll be sick with jealousy.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Oh, I'm already jealous.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I love Boulder.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Boulder, 27 square miles surrounded by reality.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   From Hermosa.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hermosa.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   See, I can't even get it right when I get it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hermosa.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Hey, and even though I'm not actually located in San Francisco,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I've built myself a scale model of the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   out of spare iPods and Firewire cables,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and I've hung up free-to-bet banner from it down here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I just -- I'm just getting word from the Chinese embassy.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Yes, they are backing down.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Well done!
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   We just needed Ron to put his iPods to positive action.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Now, Ron, this is your first time on Macbreak, right?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I think it is.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Great to be here.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Can you give people a little of your background so they know why
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   you're here?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   As to why.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   That's rather existential.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But, I mean, my background's in visual effects and that sort of stuff.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And photography as well.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And for those of you that haven't yet caught the This Week
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   in Photography podcast that Alex and Scott Born and I
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and a few others do.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's mostly where you'll hear me on the ether these days.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And you also -- you had a stint with a company in Cupertino, right?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah, I guess I'm actually one of the rare guests that's actually worked
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   for Apple at one point in time.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I was acquired by Apple.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We had a little small software company for doing visual effects software
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   called Shake, which you probably heard of.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I know you guys use it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And that was acquired by Apple many years ago.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I did my tour of duty at Apple after we were acquired.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But I've been out of there for about a year now.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So I can say all kinds of bad things about them and hopefully not
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   a terrible retribution.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Also here in the studio, we've got John Foster.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Hey, John.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I have one question.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   What's Andy and not code doing on This Week in Media?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's everybody hears from that show.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It wasn't more -- it was a more twin-like news.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We have more twin-like guests.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I've decided that before I'm 40, I want to be on every podcast,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   ever recorded everywhere.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And this week in the conference, I've made a lot of leaps toward that goal
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   because everybody has an iPod with a Belkin microphone attached to it
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and I've been asked to say things into it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   What is the conference about?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's really cool.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It started in about 60 years.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   This is the 60th time this has been run.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It started off as a way to bamboozled the university into paying
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   to have Eleanor Roosevelt flown out here to get a talk to the students.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So they turned him down the request for her to be a speaker initially.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But then when some clever history professors said,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   "Well, what if we have a week-long conference on World Affairs, let's call it?"
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And which we bring 100 people from all different professional disciplines
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   to talk about issues of the day in a public forum for the --
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   used to recall a Colorado campus community and Boulder community.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Would that work?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Then they wrote them a check.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So it was cool.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I mean, just during lunch, I was at a table and the director of the SETI Institute
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   was talking to Dave Grewson about what kind of music dogs would compose
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   if they could compose music.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So you have a lot of conversations that you just aren't going to have alone
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   in my house watching TV.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That's for sure.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Now, the question is from a Mac break point of view, of course,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   was there a high Mac content at the show?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'm here, so that's definitely true.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I've done a lot of iPhone troubleshooting and people talking to people
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   about my Mac Air here, people who want long to touch it and have long to buy one,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   but haven't actually seen one.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   James Randy got an iPhone.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   He's writing about it for the Wall Street Journal, I think.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   So we've been talking about the lack of button and the lack of voice dialing
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   that he wishes -- the features that he wishes has had.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I mean, it's Apple, man.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's a college campus, so the Apple logo is everywhere.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah, I've been noticing as I travel, especially in airports,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   the Mac content is very high.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So that and when you log on to Pittsburgh International Airport,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I was there over last weekend.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   There were at least 20, I think I counted 26 people with their Wi-Fi open,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and I actually made a little text document and I would just drop it into their desktop.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah, that's the -- every time I come to a college campus,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I had to sort of bastard-proof this computer, like, okay, everything --
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   every port, shut it down, every piece of software, disable it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Don't set mail so it doesn't automatically launch itself when I open up the lid.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's like, oh, jeez.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You really have to -- I mean, it's amazing because Pittsburgh has an open free Wi-Fi,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and you really realize people bought the laptops,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   didn't really think of closing it down, work at the office,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   put the, you know, just say, share and not think about it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I was amazed.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   There were six computers that were open that were literally --
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I could just go right to their desktop.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Isn't that like -- screw the desktop.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Isn't the fun part, you know, going to iTunes and see what shared libraries are available?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I just -- listening to some 60, 70-year-old man's, like, music library or something like --
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   No, no, no, no, no one was sharing their photo or iTunes.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And now what I did, of course, is I had this little text document that said,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   you know, whether you know it or not, your computer's opened.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   You know, I'm leaving this on your desktop.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You should probably shut it down.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   So that was the -- my little warning there for people like --
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I was waiting for a flight and had nothing better to do.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So the --
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's nothing to freak out the squares.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   You know, that's a good thing you didn't do that in Florida, Alex,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   because you would have been arrested for computer trespassing.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm sure.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   There's that law there.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Is that -- is that a law there?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Yeah, there's a law there.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Well, not in Pittsburgh.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I'd be more concerned about the concealed carry law than any, like, eavesdropping laws.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Don't do that in Texas, for instance.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah, well, the person got to figure out who's leaving the note, you know, so --
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Yeah, the --
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now, in the news, we have Apple.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It is official.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Apple has surpassed Walmart as the number one music reseller --
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   or the music seller in the world.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Or U.S., sorry, in the U.S.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and so they have 19% of the market versus Walmart's 15%.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And so they have really kind of, I think, you know, turned that corner.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I think they did it a lot faster than I expected.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Was this a surprise to you guys?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'm surprised because, like, Walmart just -- you're not just not used to hearing Walmart being
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   described as the number two seller of anything.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Right.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   But when you see the numbers, there's also a report that came out just the other day,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   a really good study of polling young users of music, asking them where their music use is
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   going, where their music purchase is going.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And I knew that people were abandoning -- were abandoning CDs and Dros, but I did not know
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that it would be as high as, you know, fewer than 20% had bought a CD in the previous year.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   When you ask them, "Where are you buying your digital music?"
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   iTunes comes in at, like, somewhere in the mid-80s, all the rest come by.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   When you break out other music retailers, it comes down to less than 2% apiece.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I'm not sure if that study reflects Amazon MP3, but even so, that really shows that Apple is now
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   almost at the point of arrogance with the iTunes store.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I just hope it doesn't leave them to do stupid things, you know?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Well, you know, I think that one of the things that's interesting is that really -- there's this
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   block, and I think the block is probably 15 to 35 to 40, where people are really buying lots
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and lots of music.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You know, that's the time when most of us have grown through it.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I know that I'm exiting that time zone.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That's kind of graphic.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And I find that I'm quite happy that, you know, listening to a lot of old 80s songs.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You're stuck in time.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Yeah, my daughter, you know, she was sitting there, we were watching something, I was visiting
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   them in Pittsburgh, and we popped open, and it was the best of the 80s.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And I was very excited.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And fortunately for me, my daughter's a bit of a music geek, and she actually enjoyed it as well.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   At least she told me so.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I think more than any good points, too, you know, it's all about -- for something like
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   this, it's all about convenience, you know?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.600]   I mean, it's the amazing thing to me is that there's not a single, you know, surviving
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.800]   pure music company on that list.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   You know, all the Virgin megastores and tower records are, you know, dying off.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.000]   And it's just, you know, what's the easiest way to get it?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   What's convenient?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Whether it's just convenient online, and iTunes make it extremely convenient.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Or, you know, if you're in Walmart and you may as well pick up a CD or something.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Instat says that digital is going to be 40% of all the music in four years.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   40% is present.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I bet it's going to be more.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Oh, really?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I mean, as soon as people realize it, it's like, why do you bother buying a CD?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Right.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Right.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, I think that it's so ubiquitous now.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I mean, you don't really see CD players out there anywhere anymore.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I mean, it's -- I mean, I lose more iPods than them.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I lost another one.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   There's an article in the Guardian code.uk that talks about how 95% of youngsters are going
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to buy a CD or something like that.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I don't even have to think about it.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's a single button click.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I can get it.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Even iTunes is a little bit more.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   But once you've got it set up,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   it's just easier.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   The same thing with Amazon.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's pretty easy.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Although I think Amazon could do a better job
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   of making it transparent too.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Well, that was another interesting metric.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   In the same poll, the audience that is doing
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   the most illegal downloading,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   you see the percentage of people who report
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   that they download illegally has been steadily
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   trending downwards since 2004, 2005,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and the same audience is saying
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   that they are buying more stuff by iTunes.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I don't know possibly it's because ever since
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   2005 they are aware that if they tell people
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   they steal music online, they can get sued by the
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   RIAA.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But it's interesting.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I would like to see that when I was reading
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   the study, I wanted to see that break broken
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   down more to see if iTunes is actually stealing
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   business away from peer to peer, so to speak.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Or if it's to bring new people in.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Now, the question is also is if it's true that
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   we're going to go to 40% of all of the
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   music is downloaded and Apple already has 19%
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   of the overall market when it's not that big yet.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Is anyone going to be able to catch Apple?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I mean, is Apple just going to keep on moving
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   down this path and having near total
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   control over this market?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Well, I think the music industry doesn't
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   want that to happen.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So they're going to continue to offer better
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and better deals to Amazon and the other makers.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   The number of titles that's available unlocked
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   unprotected by Amazon MP3 out leads the iTunes
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   plus catalog by a considerable stretch.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   I think there's some like six and a half million
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   songs in the iTunes library versus four and a half
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   million songs on Amazon MP3.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Which is more songs.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Only like 10% of what I actually want though.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That's the problem.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   When I go to Amazon.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I can't find it.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I was a little bit surprised.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Most of the stuff you can find you can find on Amazon.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   That's not a really big gap.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I mean, I was running a column and trying to talk
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   about Amazon MP3 and wanted to use it.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I wanted to say, but of course the deeper you go into
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   the catalog, the less likely you're going to find
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   on Amazon MP3.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And so I plucked out what's the more most obscure
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   musician I can think of.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And I was thinking of this British music hall
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   ukulele player of the 1930s, George Formby.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   They're not going to have George Formby records.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And they had more George Formby records on Amazon
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   MP3 than iTunes did.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I'm like, oh damn.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   No, no, no, they're good.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   That's similar.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Do we think that Amazon is really the only one that
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   could catch Apple at this point?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I think so.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Well, I think that you're going to see a lot of other
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   creative stuff like the subscription model that you've
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   talked about and it's going to be a, you know, a variety
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   of different things.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I'm not even sure that number is going to be meaningful
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   because it's not going to be, you know, you're going
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   to have to look at dollars coming into the, to the
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   industry, not individual song sales.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Or what Amazon have to do to catch up?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   They'd have to come up with an iTunes like client.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   They'd have to come up with a better store.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yeah, make it easier to just get it, you know, onto your
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   iPod and take it really.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   To me, the, I mean, I'm, I, when I look at it, I mean, I'm
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   very, I think Air is a perfect match for an Amazon music
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   store.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   You know, the Adobe's Air.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Well, you don't even need Air.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   If you tried Photoshop Express, their new online photo
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   marketing photo management tool that Adobe has, that's not
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Air.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   That's just straight flash nine.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I didn't have to install anything on any of my machines
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   to get this Photoshop working.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   The problem is, is that there's no persistence.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   So, so I mean, we're not very much persistence.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And so, and I have to be connected.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So you also have to be able to talk to the metal.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You have to be able to access the iPod's directory.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Yeah, I think that's exactly it.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You know, how far can somebody else go to, to take over
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   from iTunes and be an alternate way of putting stuff on to
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   an iPod?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Okay, but Amazon has a really nice helper application that will
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   take over the download when you buy it off of the website that
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   will basically throw it right into your iTunes library for you.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I could then add a smart playlist or through any other way to
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   find a way to catch that new content and put it automatically
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   into a new playlist.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I think that's a solvable problem for Amazon.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It's not.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I agree.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They just need to do it.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Well, no, they already have the helpers already a big leap
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   forward.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   When I first tried Amazon MP3 in the fall, one of the reasons
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   why I didn't like it was because it's a really ugly purchasing
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   interface.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's just not a browsable way to find the music that you're
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   not.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   You don't know you're interested until you into iTunes helps
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   you find it.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But also it's, you know, oh good.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Now there's an icon on my desktop.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Now what's the F key to finally unbury my desktop?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Okay, there it is.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Now I can drag this into iTunes.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   But now it's, it just lands in my iTunes library.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And that's, that's, that really, that's unfortunately that
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   took me to the point where most of the time I do all my
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   browsing on iTunes as usual.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   But the first thing I do when I want to buy it is go onto
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Amazon and see if it's available there first because I know
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   this is going to be available on, on locked MP3 as opposed to
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   something, something that's protected by iTunes.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Now as this all builds up as we start to see all these sales,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   when we start to see Apple moving forward, of course,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   a California lawmaker wants to change the law to tax
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   iTunes pretending that infinite goods are tangible.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So this is, I can't remember his name.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   This is a habit here in, but it's out of LA and, and they
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   basically want to, to be adjusted so that digital goods would
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   be considered tangible goods so that they could be taxed.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Do we think this is going to go anywhere?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I mean, California is running out of money.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I think that's part of the big problem here.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   So the only, the only thing that they can do is they can tax
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   California purchases, not the rest of the country.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Right.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It does some, does some states already tax those kind of things?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I don't think so.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I think this is, that there were a couple of states that were
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   already doing it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I mean, a state can tax kind of anything they want to, right?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah, they can't.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And, but I think it's, it's that schizophrenic problem of, you
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   know, you've got the entertainment industry is going to be
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   fighting against that.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And then obviously the entertainment industry is pretty
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   big here and they got to recognize that, uh,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   well, band, they're trying to support this.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   They're trying to get, they're trying to convince the world
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   intellectual property, of course, is according to tech, tech
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   dirt intellectual property is no different than tangible property.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   This kind of goes back to the thing with the comic book
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   people, uh, that they didn't want to pay sales tax on their art
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   because it was, um, essentially on a piece of paper made with, uh,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   ink and pen.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And the state was trying to say, you must pay the sales tax on
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   these purchases.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And they're like, we don't see that.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That's going to, that's going to ruin our industry.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Oh, just half a year, 10 years ago.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Oh, but that's kind of interesting.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I mean, there's so many subtle things that come up with,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   when you see an industry that's fighting for a special legal
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   designation, you know that there's some way that the fact that
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   it's being, uh, legally defined in some court as a tangible asset
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   means that there must be a way they think that they can take
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   away a certain right from individuals who, who buy that stuff.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Although it makes, although it makes me wonder if it's suddenly
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   legally defined as a tangible asset, does it then become like a CD
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   where if I purchase a protected track from iTunes, that means
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I now legally have the right to make a copy of it, move it into
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   another format and that sort of stuff.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And can that open up a bigger bag of worms for Apple?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Well, I think, or, or, or for the record industry.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I mean, because I think that what you're looking at is that,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   is that the, if you start saying that they're tangible goods,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   well, we only have tangible goods.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   We can do whatever we want with them.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   We can, we can buy them.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   We can tear them apart.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   We sell them on someone else, right?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Exactly.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   So, so I think that, that may not be, um, exactly, uh, you know,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   what they want.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Moving on, I know this sounds like a lot like a "TwIM" episode,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   but that's what the, that's the news we were dealt here.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   But, um, big, uh, Mac name, usually for us, uh, usually around
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Mac world is Walt Mossberg.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Did you see the beat TV, uh, event that he had in Washington?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Did anyone see this video?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I watched, I watched the video.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   What did you think?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Um, you know, he's, it's an interesting thing that he's talking
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   about how video is, or that the internet is becoming video.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And I'm going to say that he should have said that the internet
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   is finally adding video to the, to its arsenal of things that we're
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   going to be seeing taken away from other markets.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   So first, his, his, his point was text.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And text was the, the easy thing because it's searchable,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   it's readable, it's, it's very lightweight in moving it around
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   the, uh, around the net.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And as we've seen broadband approaching 60% in the United
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   States, it's only logical that video would start to show up
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   there in, in lots of different ways.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And one of the things he was breaking up is that there, he's
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   basically looking at three sources, amateur, which is YouTube.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Um, mostly, uh, and pro, which is kind of what we do, you know,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   the Mac break, uh, kind of stuff for people doing kind of
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   professional level stuff and then also then up at the highest end
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   studio, which is like Hulu, which he pointed out specifically.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And the one that he was most interested in was, was the pro
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   area at this kind of, um, you know, it's not someone just picking
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   up a cam of a cell phone and, or a little camera and shooting
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   something, but it's also not, you know, lost.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Um, do you guys think that this is really going to turn a corner?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I just see, I didn't see the video.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I saw people who described it and I saw news reports on it
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   because he, you know, when Mossberg shakes his head, the whole
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   world gets stand rough.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Uh, and I just couldn't really understand that he was saying
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   anything particularly special.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Meaning this is, it seemed to, I mean, yeah, I think it's kind
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   of obvious, right?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I mean, band was going up and people want more video and clearly,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   you know, standard television distribution is going to make
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   it so, I mean, everybody's been saying that for years.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Is this going to make us away onto the, uh, purely on the internet?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Yeah, this is, this is the convergence talk that we had ten
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   years ago.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, I think the big thing is, is that we're now seeing it in a,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   someone who is very, uh, consumer oriented, what's going to
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   happen soon, not what's going to happen someday.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I think that, uh, you know, my, uh, you know, the original business
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   plan for DB garage, I think had, you know, basically the same
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   thing, you know, eight years ago or nine years ago.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And so, so it's, it's definitely something people have been
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   looking at, but the, but the, um, uh, I think that the fact that
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   someone like that is now talking about it is just showing that
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   it's much closer to the surface.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Yeah, well, it's, it's, yeah, that's definitely true to a point,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   but it's like, uh, I mean, it's been years, I think, since
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   anybody else could, uh, could refer to the internet as a specific
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   thing.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   More and more, it's the pipes that are buried behind the walls.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   We interact with the sinks.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   We interact with the washing machine.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We interact with the ice machine, you know, and now we, we talk
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   about something the internet can do.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It really does come down to a well, uh, who cares?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Tell me about more about this new sink that's coming along.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Right.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Uh, you know, yeah.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And the, the thing that I think is interesting is we bring it back
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   to Apple is that, you know, this market that he's talking about
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   that he says is that he thinks is the most interesting, the pro
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   market is really the meat of the Final Cut Pro user, you know,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   users, the pro apps.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Um, you know, there's now a million people using Final Cut Pro
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   and, uh, they are, uh, you know, they're not typically the people
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   who are putting stuff up on YouTube.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   There are some people who do, but most of those folks are using
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   something much more basic.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Um, they're also growing, a growing number in the pro area are using
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   it, but it's still, you know, the very high end is still kind of an
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   avid world, uh, though it's slowly sliding away.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Um, and, uh, but this is, you know, this is an area that I think is
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   really important for Apple.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And to be honest with you, I think that Apple is not paying much
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   attention to it.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   You know, we haven't seen a lot of new, uh, that much new except
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   for this week, um, uh, coming out of, uh, from that direction.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Do you guys think that Apple is kind of, uh, sleep with the wheel
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   in this area?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Well, speaking as a former, uh, part of the professional
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   applications group of Apple, I mean, clearly, you know, they look
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   at the profit margins and, and something like all the pro apps
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   are just a barely a blip on the radar compared to music and
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   the MacBooks and the, uh, they profitable.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Are they profitable?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Uh, I don't even know for sure.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And I'm sure I shouldn't say what I do know, but, um, yeah, I
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   mean, I, you know, I suspect.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I think they're making money.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Yeah, probably making money, but when you're a company like
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Apple, you can't look at, are they profitable or not?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   You've got to look at putting a resource here has a profit margin
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   of, you know, X and the profits, you know, putting something here
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   has a profit margin of 10 X.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Right.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Where do you, where do you put your resource?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I mean, Apple could release, you know, washing machines and
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   probably be profitable on it, but it's not a high markup item.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Okay.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Can you say anything about rumors that Apple's trying to pull away
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   from the pro apps?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I had sort of an odd experience where I had an opportunity to
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   finally talk about, uh, I movie, oh, wait, and sort of the next
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   level up tools.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Uh, and for the first time in a long time, I made a request from
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Apple for a cup, for a copy of Final Cut Express and did not get a
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   response, not a, hey, we'll get, we'll get back to you.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   We'll get back to you or hey, we're thinking about it or hey,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   we're out of the office, but absolutely no response, which kind
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   of foot now, this is nothing but rumor mongering, but I keep
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   hearing from people who are professional editors that they
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   keep hearing things about Apple, not really caring so much about
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   the pro tools anymore.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And I was wondering if that was in any way significant.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You know, the rumor swirling.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You know, you hear that.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   You know, the, now what I think that as a, as to some degree,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   a, um, a counter to that, uh, Apple did release Final Cut
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Server this week.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Um, so, uh, Final Cut Server is a, is a way to kind of manage
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   entire workflows, um, across, um, you know, a lot of editors and
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   a lot of, um, assets.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So you have asset cataloging, uh, rapid search workflow,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   automation tools, um, you know, those type of things.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   So, um, being able to do multi format delivery.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And so this is the, this is something they had, we, we expected
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to see last summer.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   This is where a lot of people started getting worried.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I mean, even I, uh, um, um, didn't expect to ever see it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I was like, you know, after we got to about January, I was like,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   yeah, we're probably not gonna see this.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   This is the, just like the, the famous, uh, work group server from
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   1985.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Promised.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Never delivered on.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   But, but here it is.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   So it's, it's, uh, you know, it has appeared.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And, uh, and so, um, it looks pretty good.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   We're actually going to, I think we're going to start testing it.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   They're the competitor because I, I'd give it up on them.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Uh, there's a, there's a matrix.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's called matrix and they, they manage, uh, do something that's
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   very similar to that.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And, um, we're going to be, uh, hopefully testing that soon, but, uh,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   because I didn't, I had, you know, of course, no one, you know,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   you, when you work, when you work with Apple enough, you kind of get
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   to a point where you lose and you don't even, you're not even
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   interested in finding, um, the inside scoop because, you know,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   either you'll get in trouble or they'll get in trouble.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   You've been beaten down by life at this point and I are just
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   praying for the sweet, sweet, merciful release of a job in PR.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's just, you know, you're just not interested.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   I don't want to, it's just about, if, if, when I know people are
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   talking to anyone at Apple, I just go, you know, if I's talked about this,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I would, uh, either, uh, I'd never hear from anyone at Apple and, uh,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   then get fired.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So, um, but, you know, so without hearing anything, I was really, uh,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I really didn't expect to see this.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   So, it's an interesting process.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Uh, hopefully we'll see Apple.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I don't know, you know, Apple's not showing up at NAB next week.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Um, by the way, we're doing a,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   - But, couldn't neither of us is added.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   - No, it's neither of us.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   - And I think that's more of a trend, uh, in the industry.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I think people are looking at the amount of money spent on these booths.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I mean, for people, for the uninitiated, you know, the cost of these booths is
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   anywhere from a, you know, for a larger booth like that is anywhere
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   from a million to $5 million for the week.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   When you look at all the people, resources moving union fees, union fees, union fees.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Sorry.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   We did our first booth.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   We did our first booth at Macworld.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I would like, I would like to just reiterate for the sake of our listening audience that
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Mac Break Weekly is the friend of organized labor, is the friend of the working man.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   We are, we are the hand up that will break your chains that the industrial
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   workers say.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   We joke, but we love.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   - So, uh, in the, uh, in the video area, Adobe Today has released, um, the Adobe Media
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Player, otherwise known as AMP.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Have you guys seen that?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   - Nope.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   - Uh, AMP.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   - Uh, AMP is a new, uh, way to distribute, um, content.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   So it's going to be adding, it's, it's really designed to, uh, add a lot of, um, features
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   that, you know, being able to subscribe to stuff, being able to, uh, it has its own DRM,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   uh, if you want to use it, uh, kind of built in so that you can, you know, there's a DRM server
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   that kind of makes that, makes that work.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   It also lets you start doing some of the stuff that I think that we, on, on TWIM, we've talked
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   about, um, a lot, which is being able to add some basic levels of, uh, of interactivity,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   because it's all, you know, of course, sitting on flash.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   - And so- - I mean, what, what is, you know, what makes this different from the 3,743
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   other video platforms that are out there right now that already have a piece of the market?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   - Well, I think that part of it is, is that it's, um, that it's, um, Adobe.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   - Yeah. - And, and that they have, uh, and that they're really, um, you know,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   giving, you know, building a lot of components for this.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And it's, I know it's been a very big process for Adobe to kind of get this, um, you know,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   get it off the ground.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   They, they were showing it last year at, at NAB.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And I'm sure they'll be showing a lot of it, uh, here.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And, uh, it looks like, uh, uh, it, it's the first thing that I've seen that I really got excited
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   about, oh, we should put some content on there.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   You know, we've been, we've been pretty much a iTunes only kind of, uh, environment.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And, um, and this is the first thing that I've seen where I've, I've really felt like,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   oh, we really need to, uh, you know, throw some stuff on there.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The ability to kind of go through the different pieces, um, being able to, you know, get the
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   information back.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And here's the thing is with a lot of the other players, here's, here's, I find that
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   they're very limited in the way they manage the, the video.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I mean, I, I haven't been that blown away by blip or, or by some of these other ones where they're
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   doing the, all the, you know, with the way that they do the compression or the way they add
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   the interactivity, uh, we don't have enough control as developers, um, um, or it's way too
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   much work.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   So, so if I want to put up some, you know, high definition content or reasonably high definition
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   content, I mean, it was the best platform right now for high quality, you know, free, the
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   equivalent of, of YouTube, but higher definition.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Anybody?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Well, it depends on if you want to be in the browser or if you want to be in your own
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   browser, I mean, so if you want to be in the browser, it's easily accessible, you know,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   something, something that has the accessibility of something like YouTube.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   That is, no, is quick time okay?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Uh, I, I just, you can do, you can do quick time progressive for free on any HTTP server.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Well, but, uh, but I'm talking a full on environment like a YouTube where I don't have to pay anything.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I don't have to have my own website to host it.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I just want to put, you know, something up there.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Well, I have to say that, you know, I, I don't, I haven't seen that many.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   There, there are some people that have been talking about it and I, and, um, and, you know, the rumor, of course, is that YouTube is going to do something that less people do higher quality video and some of, some people are saying some of it's already getting there.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Um, but I, uh, for me, the best solution right now that, that we have found is still, uh, if you are, you know, we work with cash fly to do a lot of stuff and we're really appreciative of a lot of the support that they do.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Um, and we also, for some of our smaller podcasts are putting stuff on, uh, and some of our HD stuff and everything else are putting some, some stuff on Libson in Libson's like 30 bucks a month.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And so it's almost free. It's not quite free.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And you just can't put more than 800 megs a month up.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   So, uh, the transfer fees are, there's no transfer fees.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Um, and, uh, uh, and we have found that that's been, you know, when people ask me, oh, I'm going to be, I'm going to go buy a service and I just want to get started and I don't know how big it's going to get and I want to throw it up.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That one is the easiest one, um, to put up something that is, you know, 960 by 540.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And I think that, you know, technically 960 by 540 is HD and it's really the largest anyone needs to produce anything.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And that's coming from someone who spent two years doing 1080p podcasts.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And then point, uh, RSS feed to it and, and there you go.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   You're in, you're in iTunes or you're in, um, uh, what is it?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Democracy.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah. I mean, it's the new, the new, uh, Miro.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And Miro is really cool. When you look at Miro, when you look at, uh, also, um, who's the Azurias?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Um, uh, yeah, the Azurias component.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I think Voodoo is not, I don't remember.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Anyway, so the, uh, the, these are all great when, when you start using bit torrent clients, of course, you can really start throwing some stuff up there.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   We're going to actually use that.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   We're, uh, just because we can, uh, we are going to, um, shoot a 4K Mac break or a couple of 4K, 4K Mac breaks next week.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Could you, could you shoot that in stereo while you're at it?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   You know, we almost could. We got two Reds.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   You got two Reds. We got two Reds.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Oh, we should do it. The problem is the Reds.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   The Reds aren't quite close enough together.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   They're, they're not, you can't, you can't actually get them close enough together to get, to get the proper, um, distance between them.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   You, we think you do.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Your eyes, you, you adjust. All it, all it does is make stuff look like a little bit more of a miniature.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   It'll just make everyone give everybody a headache.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   No, we're, we're shooting with two Reds. We're shooting Mac break over in Pittsburgh with cinematics and, uh, Justine Esarick. I Justine.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And, uh, so just cause, you know, we could.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And so we're going to actually try putting up a 4K Mac break, uh, for no reason other than it would be fun.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Now when you talk about, when you talk about Reds close together, you're not talking about those trucker pills.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I've been trying, I've been googling like a madman for the past four minutes.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I'm still not sure I completely understand the customer.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   We're actually talking about a collection of communists.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Yeah, exactly. It's Chinese actually. They're, they're, they're going to be shooting with us after the pro, the Tibetan protest.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   They're, they're really trying to move their PR in a positive direction.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And they thought that maybe if they help Mac break, it would, it would help show their, their kinder softer side.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Uh, no, actually, um, the red is a, uh, is a big camera. Uh, it is, um, it is created by the, the former, uh, uh, well, actually the, the founder of Oakley.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And, um, it is, uh, it's basically a, a $17,000 camera or actually when it's all built out about a $45,000 camera that acts like a quarter million dollar camera.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It's basically a digital film camera and, uh, they're in the, in the media, you know, in the, this weekend media kind of thing.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   We were almost red fanboys when we, when we got started.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Yeah, you got a lot of flack for that, Alex.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And we stopped talking about it.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And then now we're going to get a lot of flack on Mac break weekly.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Exactly. They're like, oh, I thought this was all right.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And, uh, so anyway, um, but it's a little heavy.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Have you seen that you can now buy later hose and with iPod controls on them?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Later, hosen.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I saw this.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Ron posted this later, hosen, and it actually is pretty, pretty darn cool.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Have you seen this?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Andy, did you see the later, hosen?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I'm, I'm oddly enough, not very much in tune with the, um, companies and goings of later hose of technology.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Because it's really close to the tech pants.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   It's really close to the tech pants.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Ron sent it out earlier.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So evidently, I think this was on boy and boy.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Is that right?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Yeah, it was on boy and boy.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And so evidently they have later hosen with the play and the fast forward and everything else built into the later hosen.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Anybody want to bet I'm, I'm not plugging later hosen and iPod into Google.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Who wants to bet that's the old, that's the first, first hit.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   You just have to know how to spell leader hosen.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Yeah, that has the problem.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Later hosen.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And it's not L-H-E-R hose, uh, H-O-S-E, uh, and later hosen.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I misspelled it and still got it numbered.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   But you just, so later.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   It was full of things.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   You got these pants on.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   You have to do like the, like the German and face slapping pants.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Like for the Griswold used to do.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Yeah, the thing is that actually only plays while you're yodeling.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   I actually think it's just a way to trick women into touching her pants.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   If you want to see the love, I've got my hands are full of groceries.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Can you please click the next track button again?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So just so everyone knows, if you type in later hosen is L-A-T-E-R-S-H-O-S-E-N iPod, it, uh, Google
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   changes the spelling for you.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   You don't even have to get close.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Yeah, so it's a pretty, um, it's pretty impressive.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I think that if you added that feature with your tech pants, I think we really would have something very special.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I'm wearing my, I'm wearing my internet pants right now, as a matter of fact.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I really, I, I need to get them.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I'm telling you, so yesterday, uh, I was, I was at like a couple of parties and I couldn't really bring my bag with me.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   So I had to carry everything in my internet pants.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And so I had a, a, a, a replacement lens for my SLR.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I had my flip video camera.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I had my iPod.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I had my other iPod.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Uh, and I actually also had an, an, an, an oak, oh, I can't pronounce it.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   The Oak QO like index card size, Windows PC, like in my back pocket.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Right.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It was the most expensive pair of pants.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   I had, I definitely had the most expensive pant load of anybody at that party.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I've been using, I, I usually when I'm traveling in, in the plane, I usually, I have this rain jacket that I always wear because it's really light and it has lots of pockets.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And so I fill it up with gear.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Um, and, uh, because that's how I go through the, um, through the security.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I just throw the bat and throw the, throw the jacket in and go, I'm sorry.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It works really well unless you leave it underneath the, the, uh, the seat in front of you when you get off the flight.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And, uh, yeah.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Actually for years and years and years, I've always gotten through, I've, I bought a police gun belt, uh, at a actual police supply store and I keep a collection of different pouches and like hangers off of it.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And that is how I get the security.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   All my iPods, all my cameras, everything hangs off this gun belt.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I just simply unclick it, put it on the belt, look it back on.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Because my problem has always been like refilling my pockets after, after later.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Of course, I mean, the airport.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   So carrying a gun belt through security is a recommended way.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Yes.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I think it's a healthy, when magically enough, when I'm in an airport, it turns into a tool belt.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I, I, I, I really think that a bandolier would be really good.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You know, kind of coming across one shoulder with.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   That would be, uh, I think that would work really, really well.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   So speaking of Mac, I have a Mac question for people.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   This is my first time on the show.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I really wanted to just do a show full of my wines.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Is anybody, is anybody using, um, Mac 2008 office?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I don't use office anymore.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I got rid of it.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I'm using, I'm using text edit primarily for all of my writing.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I use, I use text edit to do most of my writing and then I, I use numbers all, all the time.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I mean, I organize all of our pursuits, everything else and numbers.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   What are you saying?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I'm using word 2008 chiefly as a way to explain to people why I switched to Scrivener early in the year.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I'd never look back.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Scrivener has truly, it's weird when you have a tool that you've been relying on for, I mean,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.800]   I've used, I've been making money off of work since like 1989, 1990, since I like first
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.680]   started publishing stuff.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.440]   And that's been what I used as a, as a main word processor, you know, since I was 17 or
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.440]   18.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.520]   And now, in the space of like three days, I have never launched it again.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.960]   It is all in Scrivener no matter what I have to do.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.240]   I know that Scrivener has the tools to organize my thoughts, to organize the ideas and publish
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   them.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's just, oh, it's a superstar.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.520]   I just, I just want that outline mode that word has.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.040]   At 2008, it blows.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.400]   I mean, it just buggies out.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.240]   So basically, I guess this is my warning to the rest of the world.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.600]   I totally regret having upgraded to 2008, Mac 2008 to office.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.760]   I regret every update after Office 5.1.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:37.000]   So can you use Omni-Outliner as your, as your, uh, outliner of choice?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.200]   Yeah, yeah, I could.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.400]   I mean, it's, I like on the outliner, but then you're in this mode of you're going back
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   and forth between things and I just want to, I wish, I wish something like Scrivener would
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   have more of an outline mode in there and I would switch in a heartbeat.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.960]   That's, that's, that's where we're at with the, the online development.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.880]   I mean, I have to admit that I don't, I just don't need that much.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.080]   I like pages just seems a little heavy for what, from what I need most of the time.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Most of the time I just need raw text.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.880]   I send it to somebody and they sort it out.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.960]   You know, it's not, it's not something that I have to deal with.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.120]   And the only thing I have to deal with that has to be printed is the stuff I do out of
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   numbers.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:17.800]   Now, we've got, we've got our picks for the week coming up here, but before we do that,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.600]   does anyone have an audible pick?
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.040]   You have another one, Andy?
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.400]   I always know that we can go to Andy and he'll, he'll be, he'll be listening.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.560]   I'll give you one too.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   Okay.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   Ron, go.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.200]   This is, this is just a little minor one, but I just searched around and on audible, they
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.320]   actually do have some of the old time radio shows.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.360]   And I recommend the, for a nice, you know, quickie half hour, there was this radio show
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.840]   called X minus one.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.960]   It was done back in, I don't know, like the 40s.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.440]   It was all these old science fiction short stories, serialized as radio programs, you
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.720]   know, stuff from Asimov and Heinlein and Ted Sturgeon and stuff.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   And they're great.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.640]   They're just, you know, a little 95 cents and you got a little half hour of disappearing
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.040]   into a different, a different time.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040]   That sounds great.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   I have been listening to some of that.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.160]   There was a, there's an, there's some open source areas that have some of the various
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   old radio shows.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.600]   Yeah, you can find a lot of these online, but it's kind of nice to download it.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   Grab it and this chief.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   So X minus one.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   Very good.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.400]   X X X minus minus minus minus.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   No, that's the answer.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.400]   The, of course audible is has over 35,000 titles.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.880]   It's the leading producer of spoken word entertainment.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:41.360]   And you can, of course, log on from audible.com/macbreakweekly and get your choice when you sign up today of a free audio book.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.160]   So definitely check that out.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.920]   Who has got pics for the day?
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.000]   I definitely have a pic.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.920]   And there are times on the show when we, I find myself wanting to pick something that
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.200]   I know that's been picked before, but you cannot pick visual hub frequently enough.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:03.640]   That's, you know, you can go to icquint.org and download a free application that will convert
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.520]   most video formats to a iPod study, iPod, Studley format.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.640]   But visual hub is the one they want you to buy.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.760]   They're giving you away that tool to say, look how good this is for nothing.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.040]   If you give us 20 bucks, we can really sensational, we can really knock something off of you that
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.800]   you don't want to have knocked off of you.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.000]   Especially because I'm traveling right now.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.960]   I'm on a MacBook Air, not even my real, like the, my actual MacBook.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.360]   But it's a good tool just to have on your hard drive waiting for the moment when you're
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.800]   in your hotel room and you've just recorded something really, really cool off your flip
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   video.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.640]   James Randy was doing close up magic like at dinner and I'm like, is it okay if I record
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.840]   you, I had to do the magic trick right at the end?
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.280]   And so got home, got back to the, got back to the hotel, got to my MacBook.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.880]   I did not have the right software for it.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.800]   But of course, visual hub for 20 bucks was more than willing to take the flip video file
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.360]   and convert it into big, bold, you know, full resolution quick time that I could then dump
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360]   into iMovie.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.440]   The same, same thing if you have like a quick time that, you know, you, you, you, you,
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.080]   quick that the iTunes is that really helpful error.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.640]   This is not the correct for bad for your iPod.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.880]   So therefore I refuse to convert it, even though it is a quick time, it will do whatever
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.520]   it has to do to convert it to the right format.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.960]   It's, it's the one, it's like a swiss army knife of converting media.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.320]   Yeah, no matter what, if the, it does flash video, doesn't it?
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   I mean, it just basically in windows media, everything you have.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.680]   It's been one of the thing, the go to things for us.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.440]   If we need, if we get an AVI that we need to turn over somewhere or, you know, back
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.560]   and forth, it is the key to the operation.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.000]   I mean, the bottom line is it's cheap enough that you can just afford to buy it and have
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.480]   it there because I assure you that if you have an iPod or if you do anything with any
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.920]   kind of video, whether you shoot it yourself or just download it, at some point in your
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.960]   life, the answer to a really important problem will be, oh, visual hub, great, I have that.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   Yep.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   Excellent.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   And how much you said it was 1995?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   Is that right?
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.240]   I had to buy a new copy because I didn't bring my license code with me and I remember being
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.280]   more expensive than 20 bucks, but they just charged me 20 bucks for it.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.000]   I didn't even tell you that I was the fabulous Andy Nocko as if that would have meant anything.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.080]   But it's definitely affordable.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.640]   Ron, do you have a pick for us?
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   Sure.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:13.680]   So this is a little tiny one, but I mean, I'm not, I'm not real good about being as security
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.840]   conscious as I should be.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.480]   I know that my entire life is on my laptop and I really should have stuff encoded and
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.560]   protected and all that.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.920]   But generally I run around without a password or anything on it, which is bad.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.560]   And now everybody knows everyone's going to be.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Yes, exactly.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.360]   No, so if you steal my laptop, you will have everything in there.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.240]   Are there any unique identifying stickers on your laptop?
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.840]   And if you turn it over, look on the bottom, see all the passwords to all of my online
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.360]   banking accounts are written there.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.640]   They're written backwards, but other than that, you can pretty much decode them.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.080]   Listeners, the next time it's someone you hear someone say, I never learned anything useful
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.840]   or helpful from Macbreak.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.440]   Get them to this podcast right now.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.680]   We're waking up for it.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.560]   But so I did find this cool little thing.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.040]   It's called home zone and it says, all it does is it sort of monitor, it can have it
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   monitor a couple of things, but I have it monitoring which a Wi-Fi signal is finding.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.480]   And then you can do things based on that.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.640]   So the really nice, easy thing you can do is just set it up so that when I'm at home
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.480]   and I open up the laptop, it says, oh, this is, you know, a recognized, okay network.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.520]   I don't need to have go through the password protection thing and I can just start using
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   it.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.080]   But as soon as I go somewhere else and I'm staying in a hotel, I open it up.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.640]   It recognizes that this is now a different sort of a Wi-Fi that's not on the secure list
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.080]   and it puts it into the mode where it requires a password to log in.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.080]   That's right.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   It's just easy.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.040]   It's totally free.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.600]   It's from a company called Metacork, M-E-T-A-Q-U-A-R-K.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.200]   It's Metacork.de.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.440]   And they've got a couple other pieces of software too, but HomeZone is a little pre-B1 that's
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:58.000]   available on there and gives me just slightly more security than I normally have been dealing
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   with.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   That's great.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.400]   John, do you have a view up here?
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.360]   So everyone knows that I'm a fan of having my Mac read articles to me, not just articles
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.720]   but stuff that I've written.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.920]   That way I can find the grammatical errors and the speeling errors and all the other
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.480]   stuff that goes on with that.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.000]   The double words, it's easier to have a narrator to do that.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.160]   But sometimes you want to have multiple voices and that can be a pain.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.720]   So there's this new program, the 2.0 version of Narrator from Dojo software, that lets
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.080]   you very quickly set voices for the different parts.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.080]   So here's the demonstration.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:54.360]   So I did that, I typed that joke in here while doing that.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   It's just really quick, click click click click.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.360]   There you go.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.160]   Okay, when you're not explaining the software, can you explain the joke?
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.160]   No I can't explain the joke.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   Listen, if you can explain the joke, write your answers to Mac break weekly.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.240]   Yeah, I don't understand.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.360]   You have to tag the stuff.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.560]   Yeah, you basically, there's a little button on the top that says assign.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.920]   So you set whatever voice it is and then you click in front of the paragraph and then press
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.800]   the assign button.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.520]   So you can pretty quickly tag a page of script or words or whatever you're trying to have
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   read.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.680]   I can just imagine just lots and lots of jokes all put together in computer.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.680]   In computer voice.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.160]   Are there any more natural sounding voices?
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.320]   Well there's Alex, but yeah, then that's the narrator of this and then there's all the
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.920]   ones that are built into the Mac.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.720]   And there's some other better voices that you can actually buy.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.480]   They're like 30 bucks a piece or something like that from a company and I don't have
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.280]   it right off the top of my head.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:47:00.120]   The house better sounding voices than Albert bad news bells, blowing bubbles.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.680]   You say you would what those were?
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.440]   Yeah, I thought it's got it's something like celadon, but it's not celadon.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.160]   I just googled for celadon.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:15.960]   They sell AT&T natural voice products, but I'm fiercely googling right now and people
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.720]   I'm sorry, I'm walking out of the Donner's Room Museum in front of me and so they're making
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   noise.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   My apologies.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.480]   So, so, so, so, John, help me understand.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.280]   So you're going to have something red to you.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.720]   So you read through it once and you tag everything that you want to have read to you
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.880]   in a different voice and having read the thing, then you haven't read back to you.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.040]   Well, actually, actually, yeah, exactly.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.040]   So, so actually what it is.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   See, mom, I have friends.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.280]   You know, I'm in the party right now, mom.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.680]   Make me, make me, make me sound like the giant loser that I am.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.240]   No, no, the, the, the, the key is you have an intern actually.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   I know it was things.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.080]   And then, and then recorded into an MP3 and then handed back to you in your gold plated
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.120]   MP3, an iPod, and then you listen to it in your leisure.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   I understand.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.880]   That's the, you can probably outsource that somewhere.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.200]   Yeah, and the thing is, if you sent to India and have the MP3 sent back, you could have,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.400]   you could have the monkeys tag Shakespeare and then give it back to you and then it would
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   be read to you.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Exactly.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   So one more.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   All right.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   So one more I have, I have one now.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   It's really a suggestion.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   I can't remember whether it was from an email or Twitter.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.360]   I've, I've broken down and started to Twitter.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.480]   I, I, I, the resistance was futile.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.800]   And I finally, and I'm having so much fun with it.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.400]   I, you know, the problem is now is that I have this, like it is, it's clearly a Borg,
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.320]   you know, kind of experience, you know, where, you know, because it's, you ask a question
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.680]   and you get 40 answers and I have like, I don't know.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.120]   And it went from, of course, Leo said Alex was Twittering now.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.680]   And I went from having 75 people like watching my little Twitters to, you know, 450 or 500
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.800]   people watching the Twitters and, and it's just Alex Lindsey.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.720]   It's like Twitter.com/AlexLindsey and people have been sending me all these suggestions
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.880]   for backing up my email, which I lost again.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:12.840]   And, and, and stuff like this, this is a, this is a one that was sent in, and I can't
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.960]   remember as I said, whether it was on the delicious list or on the Twitter, but it was
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.760]   CDFinder.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.960]   So, CDFinder, this is a, I've been talking a lot about the database programming that
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   we do.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.960]   We have like 120 drives or something here, raw drives, no, no cases on them.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.520]   And they just hold backups and stuff and we scan, we run them through disc tracker, which
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:38.680]   is, you know, kind of Stone Age, Stone Age technology to a cute track of it.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.840]   And this is a new one or newer called CDFinder and it's $40.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.280]   You can track up to, or you can scan up to 25 discs just to test it.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.120]   And it is German at CDFinder.de and what it does is it just looks through the, it just
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.600]   builds a database of every file name that is, that is on that drive.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.440]   And what that means is if you're doing lots and lots of backups, you just scan all these
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.560]   drives and now you can just very quickly find what drive, you know, what file is in what
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.840]   drive without actually going through the drives themselves.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.840]   It's something that we use a lot.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.480]   I mean, we do, we're just starting to use this one.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.640]   And as soon as I did the first scan of my internal drive, I was like, okay, so we're
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.120]   going to get rid of disc tracker.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.920]   This is, it is light years ahead of, ahead of that and I definitely appreciate the multiple
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.120]   people who sent me the suggestion.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.000]   It's great now, you know, when you're on these shows, you know, you get smarter without actually
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.320]   having to, to do anything.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.880]   Disc tracker is a very, very, very old program.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   It is.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.040]   It's practically, I think it's running an emulation.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.640]   It's really, really slow.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.480]   And this one actually grabs the icons.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.800]   You can say, you know, you can have it scan through and catalog all the package contents,
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.200]   all the hidden files, everything if you want to.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.760]   So it's a, it's a pretty, pretty useful little tool and for $40.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.480]   It may seem like a little bit, like a lot of money for a little utility, but if you're
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.960]   going through a lot of drives, this is the answer as far as I'm concerned.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.360]   So anyway, Andy, where can people find you?
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.000]   Well, actually before they, before they find me, I did find that great seller of really
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.680]   great voices that you're looking for kept straw test text to speech.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   Cap straw?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   That's it.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   How do you spell it?
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   Actually, CEP STRAL.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:28.040]   I actually own a couple of those voices because I do, I have an automated reaction that converts
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:33.000]   like mail and web pages into, you know, spoken podcasts that put on my, put on my iPod,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   my iPhone.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.480]   And you'll, it's almost scary how good those voices are.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.680]   You know, there's only like one good voice that they improved on, on, on leopard.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.880]   And now it's like having a whole library of really good voices.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.280]   So if you miss having a really good female UK voice,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.760]   Trisha, it sounds in paper.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.120]   Suddenly, suddenly your email becomes hot.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   Exactly.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   Ooh.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.800]   So I'm three weeks late with a manuscript and they're canceling the contract.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   Tell me that again.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   Holy slower.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.920]   So can you assign different voices to different email?
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   Why would you want to?
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   I think you.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.480]   I want to have different voices depending on when it's reading me my email.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.000]   So it came from, right?
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Alex assigned to Alex and everything else is this.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.760]   Now, now Andy, are you Twittering?
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.080]   Yes, of course I'm on Twitter.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.960]   I've, I've, I use the group think of Twitter quite a bit.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.520]   I am, I'm, I'm, I'm simply an Otco on Twitter.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.880]   If you can spell my last name, you're one step ahead of me and you can get onto Twitter.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:33.440]   IHN as an ANSI ATKO actually links to my Twitter account, my Flickr account, and my other usual
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.800]   useless ways of raging, raging loudly against the coming of night is that my, Andy not go
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.320]   celestial waste of bandwidth at c w O B dot com.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.120]   Ron, are you Twittering?
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.080]   No, I probably should.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   I should probably take this.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   I love it.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.040]   I mean, I can't, especially, especially on a day, a week like this, when I do a lot of
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.000]   people that I know who are here in Boulder who are Twittering and I've just, just from
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.560]   saying, Hey, I just finished a panel when okay.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.800]   So I'm saying, Hey, look, Oh, you're in Boulder.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.440]   You should trap this, this really great diner.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   It's right outside of blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.720]   And it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's like really great.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.800]   Imagine office chatter only useful, productive and entertaining instead of banal.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.960]   And that's what you get with Twitter.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   I totally didn't, I didn't, I didn't respect it very much.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.200]   I have to say until last week.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.200]   And I was just bored.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.840]   You know, Kirsten Sanford, Dr. Kiki had gotten me to set an account up like once ago.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   And then I just didn't do anything with it.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.000]   I put something up every once in a while and I was bored in the airport and started Twittering.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.360]   And man, it was, I got hooked really quickly.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.040]   And you get even more hooked when you have enough people that when every time you put
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   out a question, you get 10 answers and they're all good.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:45.200]   So it's, it was, so basically I'd be foolish to pass up the opportunity to have how many
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.400]   thousands of listeners know my Twitter name and I should have.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.600]   It's basically exactly.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   All right.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.760]   So I will be Twittering on Ron Brinkman.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   Okay.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   With two ends.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.920]   Oh, and BRI, MKMA.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.280]   And then I have no idea if that's actually available right now.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   So there's some other guy named Ron Brinkman out there that started grabbed it.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   He's going to be getting off.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.520]   He's going to be like, what's going on there?
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.520]   So definitely.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.240]   I'm going to guess that, you know, nobody with the proper German double N at the end
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.240]   of their name has actually grabbed that one yet.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.520]   So I will, I will Twitter something.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.880]   Andy, what do you actually Twitter when you're Twittering?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.640]   A bunch of different things.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.960]   I use it oftentimes when I just need to do some really, I do research, when I'm trying
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:28.320]   to look for things like I want to write about like free audio hosting solutions.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.600]   I have my own research and I've got, but you, that looks good.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.880]   But it always seems to be a good idea to, well, I'll post on Twitter saying, hey, I'm
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.360]   looking for these really cool solutions.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.360]   What do you got?
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.480]   And it will usually shake loose one or two that I hadn't heard of.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.160]   And I'm glad I heard of.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   But so much so.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.480]   It's just little things just like the, right before recording, Mac break weekly, I just
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.240]   posted, you know, hey, I'm recording Mac break weekly.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.440]   And then instantly I get about 12 people saying, oh, that's great.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.360]   Who's hosting the show today?
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.880]   Kay Mackie says, see if you can fit the word in sousines into the podcast.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   I refuse.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   Okay, I'm nobody's puppet.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.880]   Go burn.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   Oh, damn, damn.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:04.880]   Play bright with hands.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.400]   But it's, but I mean, but it's that sort of thing.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.560]   If you're looking for a productive use for it, I'm sorry, this is on the internet.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.640]   So there is no real, this is really a productive use for it.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.760]   But like I said, it's like, I do think that it's a lot like office chatter.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.360]   You know, again, I mean, sometimes it's entertaining.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.160]   Sometimes it's just a little bit interesting.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   Sometimes it's just I'm bored.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.360]   I'm going to reply to someone else's tweet.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.360]   And sometimes it, you do pick up useful stuff.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.120]   So I mean, the more people you have, the more people are following you, the more people
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.880]   you're following, the better it is, of course.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   All right.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.600]   I've officially signed up to Twitter and Ron Brinkman is now owned by me.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.320]   So I will put her something.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.200]   No, I have to admit, minor, minor mix of questions for people a little bit about what
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   I'm doing.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.560]   I don't, I think mostly it's this, I have this kind of twisted, I have kind of a twisted
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.480]   byline that's kind of going on all the time while while I'm interacting with the world.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.960]   And I think that's mostly what's going up there.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.560]   So, so it's, it's kind of, I'm having a, I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.080]   So now, John, are you Twittering?
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   I am.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.600]   I'm just simply John Foster.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.840]   No spaces, no, no capital letters.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.840]   Yep.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.640]   And yeah, you can find stuff like the, where, oh, I was able to sell my extra opening day
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   ticket via Twitter.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   Oh, really?
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   It was like Craigslist.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.200]   No, but it was, it was like, you know, who wants to go to the game?
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.000]   Find me at the, in the beer garden.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.400]   I said that wrong, be a garden and.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:32.600]   For the guy who was the guy who had a later post.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.440]   And lo and behold, somebody named Mike showed up and said, Hey, I want to go to the game.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.720]   I'm like, all right, let's go.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.200]   It's the level of, you know, it's, as I said, it was just one of those things that I didn't
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   really get.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.640]   It took me a little while to get it in my head around it.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.800]   But now I've now that I've done it.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.900]   It's actually, it actually kind of freaks me out knowing that I'm making somebody's pants
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.600]   vibrate right now.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.200]   What were you saying, Andy?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.640]   Oh, no, I was just going to say, I mean, I was exactly the same boat.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   I saw it when it was, I saw it when before it went wide.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   I didn't really understand it.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.960]   So I decided not to review it when it came first came out.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.600]   And then three months or four months later, so many people were talking about it.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   I felt I had to review it.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.280]   And I said, gee, I don't get it.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.120]   Gee, I have a hole at 140 characters to post something to the world.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.600]   How will I ever use all that space and wrote a negative review?
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.960]   But then four months or five months later, I had to go back to it and say, you know what?
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   I was wrong.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.240]   You know, it's really, I get it now.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.680]   It's really, really cool.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.200]   It does work better once you have lots of friends who happen to be using the service.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.720]   Otherwise it's sort of like being out there with one walkie talkie.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.120]   It's cool that using the technology, but it's not quite so interactive.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.360]   But yeah, I mean, a lot of people don't get it at first, but you know, there is a hole
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.480]   in your heart, the shape of Twitter, if you only open your soul and let it in.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.160]   I'm still not following very many people because I get a little overwhelmed.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.760]   I think I have to turn off the phone thing because it's just, oh, God, no.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.760]   Yeah, you don't know.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.880]   I'm only following like seven people on my phone and just constantly buzzing.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.080]   Yeah, I only use the web interface.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.440]   So I think that I might have to back, you know, increase the number of people who are following
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.520]   and decrease the level of productivity.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   You don't like your pants vibrating all the time.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.520]   Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.680]   I think he just like to be selective about who gets invited to make his pants vibrate.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   Exactly.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   He likes to dance.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.040]   See, I think that it would be great to be able to identify different people and be
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.000]   able to say, you know, these people that I'm following go to the web, these people go
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   to the phone.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   I think that's the people's pants vibrate.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.880]   That would make a big difference for me.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.800]   I want the vibration to be different.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.000]   This one vibrates a lot.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.200]   This one just this one vibrates with a British accent.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   That's you.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.000]   Then you have a whole second iPhone, second phone, you put a very special place for only
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   two or three.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Okay.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Okay.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   And with that, that's what everybody expected.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.920]   That's what everybody expected.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.480]   That's the show that everybody wanted.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.800]   We finally got there.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.560]   Is it essay for me that actually points somebody to a website then?
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.560]   Are we just getting out of it?
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   Yeah, I forgot to do that.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.040]   I do cool stuff is here or oh, you mean for here?
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:05.800]   Yeah, I like where they can find where can they find you?
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   So digitalcomposting.com.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.320]   I'm going to start blogging there.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   Digital.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   Not only am I going to start.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.400]   So these are the leftover pixels from the old monitors.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   You're just going to put them in the.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.800]   That's the thing is I get up.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.240]   The more time you buy a new monitor, there's a pixel he has it.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240]   He's telling us.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.640]   He's telling us to use those things.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.280]   He's like some grown new monitors.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.880]   It's pretty much right.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.800]   Now, see the problem is I have this book on digital compositing, which is visual effects
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.960]   related stuff, which is also available for pre-order on Amazon, the second edition, by
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.120]   the way.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.040]   But I got very tired of everybody misspelling digital compositing and typing in digital
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   composting anyway.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.760]   So I'm just going with the flow and now I have digital composting as well.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.440]   Andy, I think Andy from the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.440]   Is that right?
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.440]   Sorry.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.120]   I've upgraded my ambitions of wasting people's time and my time.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.920]   It's now the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   Same URL, C-W-O-B.com.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   John Foster.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   MacBreakTech.com.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.640]   That's where you can do anyone?
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.880]   Yeah, we do.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.160]   We did the G4 Now's Drive as promised about a year ago.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.760]   Finally, that's been up for a week.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.640]   And then we did Making Mac Your Business, which is talking about how to get started having
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.480]   a business based around Macintosh.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   It's very geeky and very enticing podcast.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.080]   If you're listening to this and you wish sometimes we were a little bit more serious
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.160]   and a little more in depth, MacBreakTech is definitely something that you can do.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.840]   It doesn't even start off like a show.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.760]   It's just a conversation already in progress.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   Excellent.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.360]   Thank you all for coming by.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.760]   Whether MacBreak or BreakTime or whatever I want to do.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.960]   No, say it right.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.720]   BreakTime is over.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:01:01.760]   [Music]
