[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   [music]
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers all things
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Macintosh in studio with us today.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The great Alex Lindsay of the Pixel Core,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Pixel Core.com.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Maguana Mina Boo.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   But it's a good more.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hey, hey, hey, baby.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   The problem response is is,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I'm a mukasay.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And Andy Anaka is also here.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Any strange thing you'd like to say to me?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   [speaking in Spanish]
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   That sounds like Russian.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It is.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Very.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Are you fluent Russian speaking?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   In that sentence, yes.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Unbreakable, Union or Freeborn Republic, something like United
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   of the United States.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It was created by Will of the People, and now watch our
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   March, our sweet Communist Land.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   [speaking in Spanish]
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Party of Linna.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Linna.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, there is a new iPhone.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So let's, we did a live thing, which we will, thanks to Bit
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Gravity, because I rebooted the machine before it's safe to
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   that.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I'm such an idiot.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So we don't have the video for reruns, nor do we have the
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   audio for replay, which is why we're here doing MacBreak Weekly
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   today.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We do a live telecast.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   In fact, I think I can now say thank you to, you remember
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   the last time at WWDC, we were watching somebody's stream in
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   the room.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It turns out it was Richard Ricardo Zamora.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It was his, it was his compadre.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So Mexican broadcasters.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And I guess, you know, he couldn't come.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Ricardo couldn't come.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So he sent his friend, and I'm not sure if I should say
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   names.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But I think at this point, it's, it's, it's over, right?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Although it'll be ill, sure that person doesn't get the
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   pass next year.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And Steve, Steve Jobs is not so much holds a grudge.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's not Steve that I'm.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He'll let it go.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Everyone at Apple is pretty easy going about that kind of stuff.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It was Javier Matuk.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Thank you, Javier.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Thank you, Ricardo Zamora Lopez.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And thank you, Ibero 909 FM.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The fun make out of it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The fun make out of it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Anyway, we got, you know, not such great video, but we were
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   able to hear the audio.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And actually that was very fun.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And we were able to watch along.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Justine was also there.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But you were in the room.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so you had probably a different take on an anti-unocco.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   What was it like in the room?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Well, I mean, it's a different sort of crowd.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I think this is actually the first modern WWDC I've ever
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   attended because as a journalist, I got the J on me, which
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   means that I'm not a person that Apple likes to have at
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   WWDC.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You could put a J on your card on your.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   No, no, no.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Right on the forehead, evidently.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.920]   And it's actually so scarlet J onto every piece of
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   journalist.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   A friend of mine was responding to it.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   I tweeted about donating blood because I think it's something
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   more people should do.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.000]   And a friend of mine said, I love to, but I can't because I've
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   got the gay on me.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And unfortunately, the Red Cross still puts a ban on that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Do they really?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   They're very, very slow in catching up.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's a media question that if you answer that question that
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   you have, you know, and get rekt.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So you must be, yeah.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You just have to be eight.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That slipped up because I was telling him about like why I was
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   only had things for one thing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So he said, oh, so you got the J on you.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   He's got the J on the journalism.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That's true.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's why I kind of, you know, I love WWDC and I would love, I
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   guess maybe I need to become a developer because I'd love to
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   stick around.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But if you're a journalist, they could.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'm also a developer, but it's one of those things where you could
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   sort of see the.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's like when the ex-boyfriend has been invited to the
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   wedding, but it's the understanding that he's just should be
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   flat or he wasn't invited.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And please don't stay after.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But it's a different vibe than like a regular like Moscone center
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Mackerel expert expo keynote because these are people who are
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   like.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Apple, you're if you screw up, you're not just disappointing me.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You're costing me money.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I will not have a personal.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   They take it personally.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So like when they cheer really strongly, that kind of means
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   something and like when you hear huge cheers at the $29 upgrade
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   price for for Snow Leopard, that's a big deal.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And also, I mean, there was a phenomenon that I have never heard
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   of any keynote ever, Apple or non.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Like if you're if you're watching one of those skateboarding
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   wipeout videos, there's any watching with a crowd of people.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   There's always that.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Oh, when they see the kid going way too fast at a crotch high
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   object and then.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Oh, and it crashed into it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so there was that moment when Apple was announcing
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   tethering and showing showing the big screen of here all the
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   worldwide carriers, I'll be supporting tethering and then
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   there's like, oh, oh, you know, we tee there.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Right.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   The entire room like, oh, Epic fail.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   They knew immediately.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   They were counting because there was already that was preceded
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   by the news about MMS.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And they leave it Apple like.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Had that one of those things where I'm going to I have to say
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   this out loud, but I'll say very quickly three and then move
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   on to the next slide.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Right.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And all carriers will have it on Dave release.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And he and T&T will have in three months anyway about this new
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   feature about truck bug tracking.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, and so I think that they're already.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Because you know, I'm sure that Apple gave didn't give AT&T any
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   warning at all that this is the plan.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Well, you know, I think that Apple still needs to prove themselves
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   with AT&T.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   They're doing something very revolutionary with the iPhone
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   here.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I mean, they're selling devices.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   They're making a lot of demands of AT&T to support these millions
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and millions of users.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You know, I mean, how must be nice to be able to leave the office
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   on Friday afternoon instead of having to work hard processing
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   all this orders and counting all the money.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I mean, you know, it's only, you know, the real thing is that
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   they only this one phone is only 30% of the new phone subscribers
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   to AT&T.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So less than half.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yeah, less than half less than half.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   AT&T really didn't come out very well out of all of this.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   No tethering, no MMS.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   They're going to add.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I'm seeing a huge backlash on price.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I mean, they're really taking it right in the neck and they
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   actually the how badly they screwed it up that it had to be
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   clarified that it's not that they're not going to be doing
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   tethering.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's just that they have no announcement to make at this time.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I had to do my one on one briefing afterward.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   You know, I had to get that question answered and every time
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I talk to Apple about anything related to AT&T, you get that
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   you hear this tone of voice of someone who was really, really
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   tired of making excuses for somebody else because they have
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   to they have to carry a lot of water for AT&T these days.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   There's so many things.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's just not there.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It's like Apple's crazy cousin.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I mean, it's like, well, I'm sorry, Dave couldn't come to
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   cook out again today, but you know how things are at the
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   office.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I'm not saying yes, he's drunk.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   He's on the sofa or he just couldn't be a good father to come
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   to a family cookout.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We know we'll pretend that's not the relationship is in
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   great shape.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Which is going to be, you know, as we don't know what the details
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   of the contractor are, but I can only imagine that Apple is
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   trying to would love to get out of it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah, you see, you see that sort of they they don't have the
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   level of power and control they would like to have.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And this time they're actually right to say that, you know, we
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   would like to control a destiny or at least mitigate the level of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   screw ups that are happening.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Right.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Well, you think this will keep people from buying?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I mean, is it?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I mean, you see, you see in the rebellions, but when it comes
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   down to, well, you do have a choice because you could, you
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   know, for those of us who have existing iPhones, you can
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   upgrade to 3.0.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That's free.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   We'll get that June 17th.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I wonder how many people will wait.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We'll say, well, okay, June 17th, I'll upgrade.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And I'll think about buying on June 19th.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Do you think anybody will do that?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I think there's a lot of people who bought the first generation
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   where they're ready to, they're ready.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   They're two years old.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   So that's not anybody who listens to this show.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Don't you think we all upgraded?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Scott is with 1.0.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   That's right.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Scott was one of the few who held off.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   He held off.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   He couldn't be with us today, by the way.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So, he'll be back next week.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So I think that there are people, there's going to be, I'm
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   guessing that it's in the millions of, you know, that are running
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   close to the all the people who bought the first day.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Well, you get those.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You're going to get those and you're going to get maybe some
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   switchers, although AT&T is getting such a bad reputation,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   you might not get some met this many.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Let's not forget, there's the pre out there for sprint people.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   That's going to cut into that a little bit.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   No?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I don't think sprints much better than AT&T.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So I think that, I think that the only sprints better data,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   sprint is better data.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I mean, the question is, would you rather have like this with a
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   better network or this with a network you wouldn't rather have?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well, that's not an obvious, you think that's obvious?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I think that's obvious.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I mean, when he says this and this, of course,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   he's talking pre with a good network versus the iPhone with
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   allows it, not lousy, but less good.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, I mean, the thing is, I mean, the user interface of the
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   iPhone is much more tangible to me than the network is connected
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   to.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I mean, using this, I was walking, it's important when you're doing
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   an Apple related keynote covering it at Moscone, that you have
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   at least three different wireless carrier devices on you,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   because everybody in that audience has an iPhone.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You can't use AT&T.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I was walking from the--
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You're pre-worked, fine though, I bet.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The pre-worked, fine, until I had to type in, access a secure
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   website to just check on something, and you know what?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I could not do it because I could not figure out how to type a
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   colon on this damn keyboard.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I could not figure it out.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Now, I haven't used--
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The symbol button didn't work?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   The symbol button didn't work, the shift button didn't work,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   the orange button didn't work.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And the thing is, you're not--
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   The problem is, Andy, is that you don't review electronics very
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   often, so you're not used to looking at different things.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yeah, I mean, you know--
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So a more sophisticated, advanced user might not have a problem.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I'm not one of them rollerblading, pre-estriving, 18-year
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   rolls of their target.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I mean, it's--
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Did you ever figure out how to make a colon on it?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I had a--
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I actually brought with me today--
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   A colon or a semicolon?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   You brought a semicolon with you?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Anything that you want to know.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I actually had to bring--
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Here, you're going to--
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Man, it's me.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I don't have mine with me.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I had to bring the getting started manual.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I don't know where any of the cameras are, so hold it up.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You're like, but I--
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Is it in the getting started manual?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I don't-- I hope so.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Because my rule is that I don't want to open a manual.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I don't want to look at anything for at least the first few days.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Yeah, I do the same thing.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I won't go by--
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   This is my figuring out.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And now I'm like, if I ever want to use this, I'm going to have to
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   like figure out how do I type a backslash?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   But that's the sort of first-fresurations.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I'm not making me see it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I think you can type that.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I think you're being obtuse.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I'm being obtuse.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Let's see if I'm being rounded at the free end.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Just like the pre.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   There's a colon.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   There's a semicolon right on here.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Okay.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   You just--
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Oh, wait.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   No, it's not a semicolon button.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   It's the place where a shift operator would be.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So I suppose I hold down the shift key.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   No, you don't hold down the shift key.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   That makes a capital M.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's right.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   You hold down the orange key.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I bet if it's you hold down the symbol key.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Oh, no, that doesn't do it either.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Look, just put a semicolon in there.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yeah, well, see, it didn't work in the browser when I was trying it.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Anyway, Andy, it's not that bad a phone, but the battery life is terrible.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And without good battery life, you're kind of--
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I wasn't saying it was a terrible phone, but I'm saying that's the sort of thing I'm talking about.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I'm not intuitive.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I think the UI in that is spectacular.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   In fact, I think Apple has a lot to learn from the pre in terms of the UI.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I think it's an excellent first effort.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I look forward to your future career, Mr. Pre, with great interest.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   However, I'm rejecting your first novel, but please do keep in mind for your second submission.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Well, you're not alone.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   In fact, I just-- Dean was like-- of course she was more about sprint than she was angry than anybody else.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   But I've seen a lot of people saying I'm not buying that pre.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Mostly Apple iPhone fanatics.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Is it my team versus your team now?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Well, I think that we really are getting into an investment issue.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   You do have an investment when you buy it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It's $100 worth of applications.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The thing is, I don't have--
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   That's a good point.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You're locked in.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I'm locked in.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I'm not interested.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It's no longer the carrier anymore.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   If Apple changed the carrier, I would just change along with them.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And that's the danger that AT&T has is a pie-piper issue.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Oh, people would go to wherever Apple went.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It has nothing to do with the carrier.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Where would be your choice for Verizon?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Andy Verizon?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I would switch, right?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Because I'm using Verizon and sprint for different wireless broadband.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Both of them work extremely well.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   The thing is, I had a lot of money invested in Windows Mobile applications.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   As soon as somebody gave me something better, I find that's $130 I'm almost never seen again.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   But I'll be able to get apps that work better for me.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I also have to have that one device to unite them all.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Right.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Well, I think that--
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Give me a better solution.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But I think that the issue is, is that if I'm sitting here--
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I think that more than ever before, I had a trio and I've had a couple of things where I bought apps for it.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And I've spent a reasonable amount of money on the apps.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   The thing is, is now I buy apps every day.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And I'm slowly building this lifestyle around the apps that I have.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And so the thing is, is not only how much money I put into it, but the Palm would have to replace every application that's part of my little world now.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And that would take a very long time.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And the problem is, as they're doing it, I'm buying more.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And I'm building more around it.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So we're not simply talking about, well, unfortunately, I've already spent $18 for this app.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's more like, I like this app, I like this other app that works with it.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I need an analog for this app.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So unless you're willing to replace all the apps that I can't deal, I can't live without.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And that's different for every person.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   If they have really good tower defense games on the pre, would you consider that that wouldn't be enough?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   That wouldn't be enough.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   No, I mean, it's a little things like I'm walking down the street and I'm checking my B of A account.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   You know, I'm able to--
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I have to say, I was loving the pre's camera and then Apple duplicated it.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And the pre doesn't do video.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I think that's going to be a huge one on the iPhone.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And the iPhone doesn't really well.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Apple, a lot of this.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   They waited until they could do a good job.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Well, and a lot of the things that the pre had that I was like, oh, I wish I had that.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Now, in the new iPhone, it's there.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And that's the thing that I think that they're going to be talking about.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Except MMS, if you're an ATT.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Well, but, okay.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Let's just start to leave.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   For now.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   For now.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   What?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   No, I'm just, okay.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I'm just going to go back to this.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   That you have some letters on this keyboard that communicate clearly that you're supposed to hold down the orange button.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Right.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So how come the backslash is in white indicating that maybe you approached one of these other two white buttons to get at it?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   No, I'm with you on that.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   That was that was a little confusing.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   That is someone who needs to be fired because it's such an easy, well, it costs you nothing to select.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Here's the logic.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   The orange keys are the number keys.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Look at what's orange.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   So there is a distinction.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I'm with you.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I'm with you on that one.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   This is in the pre.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   So the pre is not supposed to be hitting the pre.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We're supposed to be hitting AT&T.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Let's focus our race.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You don't operate like the Molochian AT&T.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But when I do think that this is a danger for AT&T, which is that if they don't figure this out and they don't get ahead of it, whenever this contract ends or wherever there's an exit, they're going to lose all.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   They should start calculating because if Apple decides they're going to move to Verizon or they're going to make it available for Verizon, that would be devastating to AT&T because because so much is building up.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You go to sales, I went to an AT&T store and it was actually easier to, I went to the Apple store to buy two iPhones for my kids and they said, "Oh, it's really hard to add the family stuff in the Apple store to the AT&T store."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   They just go to the AT&T store.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So I went over there and got them.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   The computer took forever and we spent an hour, I think, trying to sort it out of the AT&T store.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   They were really nice.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   But the interesting thing was, is all of their PR was all around all the other phones.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And I said, "How do people actually come in and buy phones other than Apple and the, I mean, other than the iPhone and the woman working there and it was like not many."
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   You know, like, you know, they're doing all this PR for all these other phones and the number one thing that was at least moving out of that store was the iPhone.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   You know, it was, you know, especially as the price of now $99.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Wow.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   That's going to be interesting.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   You think there'll be a lot of people will say, "It's hard to get somebody to buy last year's technology though, don't you know what I mean?"
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   That's not necessarily last year's technology.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Because you have 3.0.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   There was three years ahead of everything else.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It's not like, I mean, I wrote a column for, I mean, I'm either an idiot or incredibly brilliant because my Mac world worldwide columns have like a three week lead time.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And so two and a half, three weeks ago, I wrote a column about how Apple would do like a cheap phone because they have to do a cheap phone.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And what I basically came down to was what they should do is bring back like the 4 gig iPhone because it's very, very useful.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It runs iPhone apps.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's a phone in addition to running iPhone software.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   But at the same time, not having GPS and only having 4 gigs of storage won't cause it to cannibalize.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Well, I asked my wife, I said, "Could I get you the $99 phone?"
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   She said, "What's it missing?"
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I said, "GPS."
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   No, not G...
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   No, just video.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Compass...
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Compass...
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Compass and video.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And voice over.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And voice.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And I went through those three.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I said, "Voice, compass, and video."
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   She said, "Pfft, yeah.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Give me the cheap one."
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   See, the shocking thing is that I was amazed...
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   See, part of the column was that I bet that in order to make the sort of profit margin that Apple is usually custom to,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   they're going to have to redesign the 4 gig iPhone using modern techniques and try to get the cost per unit down.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   The fact that it could simply take the existing boxes out of inventory is that there is no difference whatsoever.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   This is the exact same 8 gig, 3G iPhone.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The people were buying last week or...
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Right, and now they've just knocked the price.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Well, they...
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I presume they'll put 3O on it before they ship them out.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I guess they can do that.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Or maybe do it at the store.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I don't know if they'll do it at the store.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I don't know if they'll do it at the store.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They'll probably do it at the store.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I bet they have lots of inventory.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Also, it's probably because there's probably some sort of big spreadsheet that says, "Here's how much it'll cost for us to
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   blow out all of our existing inventory of the 8 gigs."
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Or, "Here's our problem in trying to sell 8 gig phones over the next 3 months before these new hardware could go."
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   They're pointing out in the chatroom, it's missing the 3 megapixel camera as well.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Again, another feature that my wife goes, "What? Who cares?"
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   What's she going to do with that?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I really think that we're looking at the 99... It really is starting to suck the oxygen out of the phone market.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Because now you have this wide range of, if you want, $99, $199, $299, you have these phones.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Until I was really pressed on that I would buy it, my wife was not going to spend $199 or $299 on a phone.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   $99 was her limit.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I think there's going to be a bunch of people that that was their limit.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I think it's going to be a big summer for Apple, for Apple, for iPhone developers and so on and so forth.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   This market grows by millions.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   That was exactly the problem that Apple's facing.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   They're going to quickly... In the next two years, if they did not have a $99 phone, they're going to run out of people to sell phones to.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Because everybody... They would have already gotten everybody who is willing to spend that kind of money on a phone.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And then $99, the only price level underneath that is really free with contract.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I know there's $40 and $50 to sell to other phones.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But the people who... If you're under $100, that's it.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Well, and the reality is, if Apple figured out free with contract with AT&T, it would be over.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Can you imagine? It would be over.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   It would wipe out the entire phone market.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   If people just were like, "I can get it with my AT&T contract," it literally...
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   There's still many people saying, "Yeah, it's free, but it doesn't have a slide-out keyboard, does it?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Gotcha. Sing, sing."
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   But I just think... You know what's interesting?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Because the pre doesn't have predictive text, I'm actually more accurate on the iPhone because I can mistype, but it will fix it.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   The pre, you got to get it right.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   $30 and $40 worth per minute on the virtual keyboard for me.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I would have never believed that. It took me a while, but now...
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And it's part of it, it's just saying, "I know the iPhone's going to get it right by the time I get there."
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's the secret. Use one finger, go as fast as you can. Don't really...
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The only key you can learn about is the space bar.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Right.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If you get within four centimeters of any other key, you're intended, it'll deal with it.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And I didn't realize how amazing it was until I started typing on the pre and realized...
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You know, and you don't make as many mistakes in the pre, but you still make mistakes.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Then you have to go back and then you have to go back.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I'm typing a little better with it now than I was because I intentionally said,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "Okay, I'm going to stop trimming these two nails because...
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Unless you need a small hard edge somewhere in your hand."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The biggest problem I'm having is I play this instrument called the Embira.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   This is Zimbabwean instrument. And it hardens my thumb, my two thumbs, and my finger,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   because I'm playing metal pins all the time.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And it's like playing the guitar or whatever.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And I got really, really thick skin on those areas.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And there are times now where my phone is not reacting to my phone.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   You know, when you get that new Prius, you should play the Embira in the new Prius.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You just fit right in.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You'll just...
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   There'll be some sort of point singularity that collapse, of liberalism that collapses in and of itself.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   You do wear... you do wear Birkenstocks, don't you?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Not anymore. My wife says that they make me look like a dremple.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   That's because you warm with socks. The trick is don't wear them with socks.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I've learned. You know, these things you have to learn.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Because you want your feet to tan evenly, not get those... not get those tan lines.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Right.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Oh. One is pointing out that while supplies last the 16 gigabyte second generation iPhone will also be available for $149.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   So that's a good price also. If you want a little more storage, you want to...
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Great way, once again, great way to clear out the inventory.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Who's going to buy the 32 gig? Me?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Really? You'll go with the extra storage. Do you fill up your iPhone?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I feel like I was filling it up a lot when I play video.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Especially '99.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Especially '99.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I mean, the thing is, here's what always happens to me.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I'm just giving up now. I've given in. I know it's good.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'm going to buy the middle iPod.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Yes.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And I walk out with the biggest iPod that has the most storage.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And I'm just like, "I don't want to come back and do this again."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   You know, I'd rather just spend another $100 and not have to think about it and know that I'm not going to wish,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   "Oh, if I had only gotten that 32 gig, it's $100 more now. It's $500 more later."
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You do know that you can buy an MSI Wind or a Dell Mini or an HP Mini for $300 for half that.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Yeah, and it might even have a 3-inch.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And my iPhone is more useful.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Yeah, but I can fit that.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   I can fit that in the back pocket of these pants, but I can't fit into this pocket or that pocket.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I have to say, if there was a Bluetooth, if there was a Bluetooth external keyboard, you know, for my iPhone.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Then it's a computer.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I would actually be... If I could take a little rubber one that I would kind of...
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Well, there may be. They've really added the capability.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Or if you could plug it in, even if you could just plug it in now into the Access Report.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   If I could have a keyboard, there are many times I wouldn't take my computer with me.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Yeah. I'm disappointed. I did ask about... Well, gee, now you're adding Bluetooth tethering.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Are you adding other Bluetooth profiles?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   No, no, no.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   No A2DP, which really surprised me.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I thought that was for sure.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Yeah, I mean, well, I have to...
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   That's the stereo... I didn't see it. That's the stereo Bluetooth headset.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I was asking specifically about, you know, GZ...
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Well, I was thinking about it especially, is that I think one of the first really killer apps that's going to be 3GS specific.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   The first one is going to be the TomTom.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   The second one is the connection that it can have the hardware's ability to communicate with the onboard software.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The second thing is going to be somebody's going to write a word processor that ships with a keyboard.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It has an embedded dock because that's going to be possible with the level of inter-cein intimacy that software and hardware have on...
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   with a 3.0 operating system.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And if someone charges less than $79 for that, and it gives you that really cool kangaroo folding keyboard that...
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Or rubber eyes, but the kangaroo one.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I hope for the kangaroo one.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   That's going to be the fastest check I ever wrote.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I'm going to correct myself there telling me that A2DP is built into 3.0.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I just don't see it on the list of specs, but...
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I thought it was, but unfortunately, I'm talking right now, so I can't say, "Am I wrong about that?"
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Yeah. Well, I am wrong. I guess I'm wrong on that.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   That is one thing I like about the pre. It's like every profile you can imagine is on there.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   You can push files.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Well, the one you want is HID, right? The human input device, because then that means mouse keyboard.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And that would sure be cool.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And I don't think that Apple would ever want to take the responsibility of saying, "Here is how a keyboard would work on the...
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   That's kind of a problem. What does a mouse do?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I mean, there's no pointer.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But if they simply say, "If you want to build your own that only works with software that you build, fine, go with our blessing."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And again, if it's halfway decent, like just like you said, the ability to just toss a couple things in your pockets,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   the reason why, like I like Netflix so much is that so many times I have to drive like an hour and a half
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   from my house to visit my dad and stuff. And you file your column, but then you never know until you get there,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   "Oh, I didn't get it." Or, "Gee, you made this mistake. Can you fix this?" And the fact that I simply had this in the car.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And I have enough writing to do that. It would just make a huge difference for me to be able to...
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And that's what I'm hoping to see out of a... If we ever see a media pad or whatever that might be coming out.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   That would really, that with a keyboard available would completely replace my computer three days out of a pocket.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So you guys have kind of given up on the tablet, it sounds like.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   No, a tablet would be even better.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   It's coming.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   A tablet with that kind of a hardware keyboard attachable would be even better, because it would give me so many things that I want.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I don't necessarily want... The great thing about Netflix is that it's designed to look and function exactly like a notebook.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I don't necessarily want something that looks and functions exactly like a notebook.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I don't necessarily need this hinged thing with a screen on one side and a keyboard on the other.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   If you're going to give me just a nice little square of electronics.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Let me use the... Let me... I'll carry the keyboard when I want it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I would be carrying it around chiefly as a book reader and as a media player.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And then, "Dang it, did I really say that the iPhone 3 GS cost $800 and plus you have to be spanked?"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   That only the spanking is optional depending on... Okay, fine. I'll have to edit that.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And basically, even putting up a virtual keyboard and having the full width of a sheet of paper to play with.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   That's another fast check that we get written.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Do we think we'll see that later this month?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I think later this year.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I think later this year.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   My money is on.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Sometime in 2009, they show something off or at least release an SDK that is very, very pregnant with hints.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Basically, "Oh, now we have iPhone... Okay, 3.1. We have now screen size independence built into all of our views."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So make sure that when you design, if it's appropriate, make sure you design it so that it doesn't mind being, I don't know, let's say, 768 pixels wide.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Or better at 960 by 540.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   It would be perfect. Half HD written.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Steve Jobs is going to slip in the back door then. Later this month or are they going to do something for him?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I don't know.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I thought maybe they'd have an announcement of a tablet with Steve Jobs, but I guess if that's not going to happen.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if they just had an event.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   A quick event basically.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I am in public. Look at me. I'm not some video from...
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I'm not sound video with the newspaper being held up behind.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I am interactive. I am alive. I'm doing just fine.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Another huge story. You alerted it to the beginning.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   The developers certainly liked it. $29 upgrade for no leopard.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Why do the developers like that so much?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Well, because it puts more bumps in seats.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   The whole point is that of WWDC is Apple convincing developers.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Look, we're putting all this cool stuff into the next version of the operating system.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   None of it is any good unless you decide to update your software or get some ideas for new apps to build based on it.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And the fact that $129 in previous editions, there was enough added features in the operating system to say,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   "Yes, I would spend..."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   If there were a collection of eight utilities that gives me spot-like search that gave me core animation that gave me these things.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Yes, I would individually spend $18 eight times to get this package.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   It's not easy to make that $129 sale with snow leopard because there's a lot of cool things under the hood,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but it's mostly performance. It's mostly architecture.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Well, you were talking yesterday about CL.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   OpenCL is going to make a huge difference in the performance.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   That's something you want everybody to know.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   That's not as new. I hope you can explain that to me because I was having dinner with somebody last night
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and trying to explain what this is like that. I understood OpenCL.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And then there were letters after that that I'd sort of heard of but did not know what they meant.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Well, I mean, the thing is a lot of this is similar to the CUDA coding that has been done for the NVIDIA.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And I don't completely understand it all.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   But from the research that I've been doing with OpenCL, because we're looking heavily based on our stuff that's OpenCL driven on to OpenCL.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So one of the things right now is that we get an advantage of the video card when we write to the video card.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So when we're going to the video screen, the video card helps us write that and helps us process that.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   But you could be using that video card for a lot of other things. You could be using it for scientific calculations.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You could be using it for all kinds of number crunching, rendering.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Just like the PlayStation 3 farms that are being used to work on setting, right?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's incredibly powerful. It's like you have a Ferrari and you never take it out of the city.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That's what these video cards are like.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   These souped up sports cars that never get out of the city, you never get to open them up and let their horses run.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And ever, like most of their lifetimes, they don't get to do that unless you're playing games and pushing it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And that's all you do with it. But there's so many things that they can do.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   And so OpenCL allows you to write to those cards.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And so you're able to do a lot of processing. You double the speed of H.264 compression, have massive increases in scientific calculations.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   These are the kind of things. And OpenCL allows you to write it to, if you write to CUDA, which is NVIDIA's format,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   you're using NVIDIA cards. OpenCL is going to allow you to write it and now it's going to work on the ATI cards, the Intel cards, the NVIDIA cards.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And it's going to be a very, it's going to allow you to process a lot of stuff very, very fast.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And so I think it's going to be revolutionary when it has, and we're going to see huge performance increases
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   as people start taking advantage of that technology.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And I think there's a lot of things, while it is largely under the hood, I think that there's a, Snow Leopard is a big upgrade.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   It's the biggest upgrade that I think they've had in years.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I can't wait to just get the hands on the...
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Really? Bigger than the Leopard upgrade.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Oh, I think so, yeah.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Performance. I mean, how it's going to affect you on a day-to-day basis is bigger than the Leopard interest itself.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Well, it's kind of the same thing with the iPhone 3GS. I mean, they're cool little features, but one of the slides that I don't think has been commented on.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Enough is that, oh, by the way, it's twice as fast as just about every, in almost every operation that you're going to be doing.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   How fast did they say what process? They never do say what process.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   They do, they didn't say the processor, I couldn't get that out of it.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   But it's 532 megahertz.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Well, I mean, numbers are numbers. But there's a table that they reproduce of, here's what's like on page reads.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Here's what's like in different benchmark tests.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   But they are willing to back a number of, it's twice as fast as the original iPhone 3.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   That's fantastic. And that's what gives you the capability of things like the TomTom or whatever.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Not only that, but just the new JavaScript engine in Safari, because people don't really notice that they're sending, when they're typing out an email, that the cursor is flashing much more rapidly, or more responsibly.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   But when it can load in the New York Times page, or ESPN.com, noticeably faster.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   When you're using a navigation page, like if you were like this morning, I was using the ordinary 3G to get the bus schedule.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And it's like, every year, I'm in the mode of, okay, I'll click this link and now I'll just find something else to do for 30 seconds, and I'll check the phone again to see if it's great.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And I thought that was poor AT&T bandwidth, but it turns out that's the JavaScript delays that are going through the phone.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Because I checked, I got speed test for my iPhone, so I can start testing AT&T.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Oh, really? There's a speed test for the iPhone.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   There's a speed test app for the iPhone.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Oh, I have to get that.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I realize in Petaluma, we're getting 1.7 megabits a second.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   That's the point as fast as you can get on HST.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I mean, it's until we get to the 7.2.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It's crazy fast.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And so I was like, why am I getting that kind of speed?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And everything's loading slowly, and it turns out it's the JavaScript.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Yeah, I think that I think if we're going to line up a villain for 2010, we all have to marshal our resources that JavaScript is going to be our common enemy.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Because every single company that's doing interesting things in the web are naming it as the name of their pains.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Another really great demo that part of the keynote is, of course, when it's showing Safari 4, something you can download right now in public beta, that they have a new Java engine.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   One of the coolest features during the demo was the fact that it handles JavaScript crashes so much better.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Google Chrome, I've been lusting after it for the Mac because their big selling point was that when a piece of code, like a Google reader gets hung up and is responding slowly, it doesn't freeze the entire platform or even the entire browser.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It'll just freeze that one window.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Apple in Safari, on the desktop version, seems to have gone one better and said it won't simply crash the entire web page.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It'll just crash that one bit of content that relies on that one bad code.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   So it's not even though you lose this whole link and all the work you've been doing in this link.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   It'll just say, oh, well, this is now I'm looking at a piece of Lego.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Whereas I was using, I used to be looking at it very, very poorly done video ad.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I'm good with that oddly enough.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I'll keep on working.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Notice they moved the tabs by the way in Safari for back down.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Goodness.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I kept on forgetting that I was like, where did that other page go?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Where did that other page go?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   That didn't work for me at all.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I hope you're happy community.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   You could have put your focus on this anger to demanding something be done.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   You could have done that about universal health care or hunger, but no, you asked to move.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   You wasted one of your genie wishes on moving the tabs.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   You got to pick your battles, Andy.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Pick your battles.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   One at a time.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So Safari doesn't do, I thought Safari and Chrome both are kind of based on web content.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I thought Safari would also do that threaded tabs thing.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I wish I had more time during the briefing.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'd love to see it.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I had an old page.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   There are also so many things to ask about.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   They're also talking about the HTML 5 spec and how involved they were in developing it.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And I'm aware of how active they've been in this new streaming standard and this new way of dealing with medium.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's critical.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   But I want to know, I really want to know, are you saying, here's what we're doing.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   We can either make this proprietary or you can all decide that you're going to support this.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It's up to you.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I think this is this is goes hand in hand with a refusal to put flash on the internet.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   That makes sense.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   HTML 5 has support for SVG for Canvas for you could do animation without flash.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Well, also the cool thing is that as a web developer, I would no longer have to burn like four different editions depending on what platform is being done.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   The web browser can say, "Hi, I'm a smartphone.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I'm really not very fast or powerful."
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And it's okay, final pushy, something that's very, very cheap and very, very appropriate.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And I think that something that is really interesting is this dynamic, the dynamic quick time streaming that they're, yeah, it's going on.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   You basically are, you end up compressing it in four different, three, four different compression levels.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   It is switching on the fly.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It can be switching a live show.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   You walk, I'm in the office and I'm on Wi-Fi.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I'm watching it at the highest quality that my 10 meg connection can, you know, can give me.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I walk outside and it switches to 3G and without stopping, without buffering changes to a lower quality video.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Because all the videos coming at me or ready to come at me at any moment and it just simply, you know, just switches over as I, you know, as I need it.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And so it can be switching on.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   We'll see how well that works.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Have you ever, I mean, going from a Wi-Fi to 3G on my phone is not such a good experience.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   No, no, it's not.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   This is a 3.0.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   This is a fix.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Well, we'll see.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   That handoff is tough, but if it could do that, that's impressive.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Especially.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Well, it's not just Apple.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Everyone is doing this.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   So Windows is, I mean, Microsoft's doing this.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Adobe's doing this.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It's dynamic streaming is what it's called and it's something that everybody's incorporating into the end of their screen.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Well, it's great.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You could be listening to Twit Live and you could go outside and get away from your Wi-Fi.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It still works.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   You can change that if you're watching video.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   That's really great news.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Well, we're excited about Snow Leopard.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I guess we should move on to the laptop.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Laptops.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Before we do that though, I want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Andy, you just flew out here.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I'm sure with an iPod or an iPhone loaded with fine audible listening material.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And if you didn't, just say you did.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I did.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   All right.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I didn't.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I do and I am.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Anything.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   What were you listening to on the plane?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Yes.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Yes.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   You say the Spartans were going to have to just throw you out of the room.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   You don't want to get all Spartans on a closed and closed airplane with it.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Oh, you're my.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You're my.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   You're my.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Sir, I just want to know, do you want the Diet Coke?
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   It's Pepsi.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Okay.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Instead of.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I'm pushing you off the bread.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Well, it's a really cool book that I bought based solely on the title.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   There's there.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Sometimes that's a good thing.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Well, sometimes that's a good thing.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I was on Alaska like several years.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   This is the pick, but there's a book that was I was an Anchorage, Alaska.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And I just saw a book title called my lead dog was a lesbian and said, I need to reward
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   the author, the publisher for just bravery with and it was just for the brave.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And it was just a great book.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I presume it's about the idea to ride, but I don't know.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   It was about the idea to ride a fantastic book.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I don't think it's on honorable.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   But one of those books I happen to reread like once a year, once every two years.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   But this sort of goes back to a conversation.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I think we were having a couple of weeks ago about copyright that I think the copyright
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   system we have works really great from two different angles that you have a limited period
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   of time in which an author has complete control over their work.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Not only do they get financially compensated for the work they did, but they also get
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   to protect it against any changes that they would not approve of.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   But in exchange for this at a certain point, usually 30, 40 years after the author's
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   death, it becomes the property of everybody.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Now we can make changes to it and improve it and it becomes to the benefit of society.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And so I don't think I'm going to need to even describe this book.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   What the content is, I'm just going to say that there is a new version of Pride and Prejudice.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I'm glad that Jane Austen didn't know where you're going here.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I'm glad that Jane Austen did not live long enough to see this, but I'm glad that I lived long enough
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   to buy this book.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   It is called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Yes.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It is Pride and Prejudice.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   But what if there were zombies in that world while this story was going on?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   You are not the only one who has chosen that book on Title Alone.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   I think there's quite a few people.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But did you have you listened to it yet?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I'm about three chapters in.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   When did the zombies come in?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Almost immediately.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I think the author's name is by Seth Graham Smith and Jane Austen.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Right.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And Seth Graham Smith, that could almost be a character in a Jane Austen novel.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Sure good.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   But he's very, very smart that the first chapter has to sort of set the world that lives in
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Saint.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And it sounds like a Jane Austen novel.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It's written extremely well.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It doesn't just start with the characters and then go nuts with it.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   It simply says what if this was, what if this were Austen's idea to begin with?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Or what if this is the world that she grew up in and she was just simply reflecting the
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   reality?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   She's just simply doing right with you now.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Zombies happen.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   You know, you know, they're people.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   They were.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   They were.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   When you need brains, you've got to have brains.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   This is an example of the great stuff you could listen to.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   If you're on a plane, if you're in the car, if you've got a time when you're just down
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and you can't read, but you'd love to, you know, pass the time.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Doctors office, Jim gardening, housework, they all leap to mind.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Audible.com is a great place to go.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   We want you to use the audible.com/macbreakurl.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   We don't get paid by the show, but they do pay attention to which shows get good return.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And one of the things we've noticed is everybody's using Twit as the coupon code for everything.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   So we just want to, whenever you use the coupon code, it's not that, you know, we get paid
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   differently or that shows get better.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   We just want to know which show you heard the plug on.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   That's the one to use for this one.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Now this one is in particular the gold account.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Which means one book a month.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And your first book is free.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Look at just go to audible.com anyway, browse around just to see the variety, the quality.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   It's just a wonderful place.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   It's a bookstore on the web that you can download books within seconds.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Put them on your iPod or your iPhone or your Zoom or a variety of devices and enjoy.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And I just love it.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Let's talk laptops.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I'm trying not to take it personally.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I did just buy three 13 inch laptops.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And you had to know it's coming after you bought them.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   They're still good because I bought them for my wife, my mom, and my sister.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And they're not high end users.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   So these new 13 inches, maybe I would have saved some money, but these new 13 inches, the features
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   they're putting in these are really for high end users.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I mean, firewire, the 9400 card.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   You don't have the dual card thing until you get to the 17 inch though, right?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   So that's gone.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Which by the way, if you wonder when you buy one of these pro laptops and you notice that
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   the, everything's much slower than you expected, you do have to go into any energy, turn it on
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   and turn it on and then restart.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   I was like, why is everything going so slow?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   So you noticed a difference because you know what?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   It's battery life versus performance.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And on my 15, which does have the 9400 and 9600, I went back and forth and I didn't notice enough
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   performance.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   So we haven't do it.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I have an OpenGL, you know, the, the, the, the, your Honda was using yesterday for the live key.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   You'd see that.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   That's using OpenGL and it definitely, it's an open C.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And open C.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   These are CUDA.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   This is a CUDA.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Well, CUDA, but open C.L.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   But what I'm saying is that these are Nvidia.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Right.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   So the, so what matter whether AT, ATI or a, or a, or a, well, that's what, with open C.L.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.440]   That's what's going to happen is that you can go to either if you did, because you CUDA like
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.880]   benefits on either product.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   Exactly.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   I see.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.080]   In any event, I might see a difference once we go to snow leopard, but for right now,
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.000]   I just opted for the better battery life.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   You don't have a choice on the new ones.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Firewire.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   I'm thrilled.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Is it 800?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   That's great.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Weird thing to take out the card bus and put in a card reader.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Yes.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And no, I mean, here's the thing that I'll say.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.920]   Especially since most people who are using, using pro SLRs are going to have compact flash.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.000]   That is, that is one issue, but the compact flash one is not.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.720]   So I have, this is the one that I have here.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.520]   This is, this is my, that's what I use card.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520]   That's what I use.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   Okay.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   Sandisk or whatever.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520]   And it just plugs in the card bus.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.520]   That was like 40 bucks.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   Lips in my, this lives in my life.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   Right.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.720]   And what I have to admit is that I don't use the, the compact flash when I have an external
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.080]   reader and the reason is because it sticks out of my laptop.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   It's too big.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.400]   And so I can't, and it's faster on the 800.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   I don't know if it'd be a fast track card, but it might be a fast track.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.600]   And so the, so the thing that I, the thing that I, the, so what I guess I'm left with
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.800]   is that I don't really, uh, while I complained yesterday about not having the express card,
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.720]   no, I can't, I started thinking about it.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.040]   Like how many times have I done anything other than plug in an SD?
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.840]   And I think that if I'm a user that's using a 13 inch laptop and not the 15 or 17 inch,
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.600]   the likelihood of me using anything other than that, there's going to be two or 3% or
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.960]   5% of the people that say, Oh, I can't, I need my express a lot.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.440]   But I think it's really like two to 5% of the people who might get this money by taking
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.520]   that slot out money and space too.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   And it is convenient.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.040]   Now you have the SD card in there.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.480]   Well, on top of everything else, when I was looking at the specs for these and the price
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.800]   drops, I'm thinking that we are seeing apples response to the netbook market.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.720]   Not necessarily from the idea of let's build a $400 Macintosh, but let's really justify
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.360]   the $1200 we're charging for this.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.760]   We're saying we're going to build a $1200 or even an $11 notebook that kicks the ungodly
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.800]   butt of anything being sold for half that money.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.640]   And for God's sake, anything that costs less than 400 bucks, it runs Windows, it's going
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   to crumble to dust in the mere presence of this machine.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   Although my MSI Windows has an SD card reader on it.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Well, that's why.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   All has an SD card reader.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.560]   I still want me to sort of this me.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.800]   It's just one of the standard features of just about every netbook, even one's a cost
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   to 100 bucks is SD card reader.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.680]   So that's one of the things that I thought of when I thought, okay, that's why they're
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   going to take out the standard that nobody ever uses.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   Nobody ever really uses.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   Right.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   Me too.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.440]   I mean, I have a, I'm even worse in that I have a MacBook Pro.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.800]   I have Card Bus, but I don't even have a reader for it.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.160]   I'm just so used to all this hookup external thing.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   Right.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.120]   And I think that a lot of this was, was, your kid take the, take the firewire 800 and stop
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   bothering me.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.000]   You know, you know, I'm glad they put firewire.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   But I think that was the big thing.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   That was huge.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I think that was bigger.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   That was a much bigger thing.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.720]   And inexpensive for RAM is nice too.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.840]   Being able to go to 8 gigs of RAM is a big, is a big improvement, don't you think?
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   But one thing I'm curious about is how many people are relying on the Card Bus slot for
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.480]   3G brought wireless broadband and how many people are going to be upset that maybe I
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   guess.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   I mean, there are some people who are doing that.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.760]   I think mine, mine is USB and most people I know are USB and I'm, I'm actually about
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.160]   to upgrade to the Wi-Fi.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.920]   That's such a, are you, are you enjoying it?
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   I'm enjoying it a lot.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.800]   I think I, I'm still going to wait to see what the tethering options are going to be
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   on AT&T.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.960]   I'm specifically curious about how much they're going to cost, they're going to charge for
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   it.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:16.240]   My decision is going to be that if I can get a tethering broadband for 30 bucks a month
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.440]   under the same terms, 5 gigs, 5 gig cap per month, then I'll probably just add that option
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.680]   to my iPhone.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:28.820]   If it's 60 bucks, there is no reason for me to add this option to AT&T when I can essentially
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.820]   have a second network.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.820]   Right.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:36.920]   I'm using Verizon for my US, my, we were just talking about the Wi-Fi and the, you know,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   Wi-Fi is incredible.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.640]   Well, I'm looking at getting to Wi-Fi because using them the bus right up here, I was finishing
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   a column on it.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   Do you have it here?
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   Let me see.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.220]   And for me, the thing is, is that, is that I, the reason I have a wireless modem is so
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   that I can connect anywhere.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.320]   And if I want to connect anywhere, I'm going to be using Verizon.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.920]   I mean, that's, that's the thing that I, that I.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   It's great to have both.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   It is.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   I don't think there's anything around that, both.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   I'm not going to pay, you're right, Andy.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.160]   I'm not going to pay for tethering.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   You can't find it.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.940]   It's in your deep, deep within his tactical pants.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.500]   Somebody's still surfing on it in the bus.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.780]   They're like, wow, there was, there was a note I saw on the bus.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.260]   And I was just suddenly, did they add this to the, to the 80s?
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260]   It's okay, Andy.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.260]   It's okay.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.260]   I don't need to see it.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   I'll be fine.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.860]   Poor Andy is now he wants to find it.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.340]   Just make sure I don't need to go back to a park bench in town and, oh, no, no, I know,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.500]   I know, I know, I know, because there are things, there are things, there are stupid things
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   I'm capable of doing and there's stupid things I'm not capable of doing.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.900]   One of them is leaving behind my iPhone.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.680]   Oh, what about that great feature where it'll discipline?
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   I love that.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   You can go to a waiter, go to a website, say, please make my phone make noise because,
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.840]   because it's a feature that I don't even at my house in my office.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.080]   I don't have the ability to phone my, my, my iPhone because I have no landline.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   Right.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   But only that, but here it is on a map.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.080]   I love that.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   I love that.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   I love that.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.960]   And the kill switch, the kill switch is kind of neat too.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.360]   Now does that kill it or does it just erase everything?
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.800]   Because like I'm wondering if one of us could try it.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   Oh, there it is.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.820]   Would it be safe to try or is it going to be give us a dead dead?
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.540]   No, I think you can restore it back from iPhone.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.580]   I think that is so neat.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.780]   Press press and press that one complicated button.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.780]   So I'm looking at the Wi-Fi.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.820]   It's only got an on/off switch and a micro USB connector.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.820]   And there it is.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.380]   And it goes green and now we're now live.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.020]   Now you have another base station.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.880]   Although it did kind of, I'm willing to share blame not being able to tweet for more
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.760]   than like 50 minutes from WWDC because it has this little quirk where I had a plan
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.900]   plugged into my notebook all night at the hotel because I was using it as my internet
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.980]   access.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.660]   And I keep thinking that it works like any other USB object that was plugged into USB
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   and charging.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.320]   Unfortunately, unless you have special software installed on the desktop, if you don't have
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.700]   that software installed, it cannot charge and act as a data point at the same time.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:51.180]   So I did not know that I came into that room with about 10 minutes with a life left on
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180]   the battery.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.180]   But it lasts like six or seven or eight hours.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   That's nice.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   You have to really--
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.880]   I hope I can change my USB card for that.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.480]   Because I'm assuming that I'm going to speak.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   Could I wonder if I--
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   Well, also, again--
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   You have to sign up for another eight years.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.080]   Making the point that you don't like things sticking out, not for aesthetic reasons because
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   you don't want to just knock off the stupid antenna.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   Right.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   Because you press the button in your pocket, it doesn't matter.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.680]   So long as it's anywhere within range.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.760]   They're telling me that you can restore from iTunes if you set off the kill switch.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.680]   So I think the first thing I'll do is I'll kill it.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.480]   Well, when you kill it, that does destroy everything on there.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.980]   What we're talking about is that it will simply restore from the back of the majority.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.280]   What I'll do is I'll kill it before I put anything on it.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   Just to see if that works.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.900]   And because, according to the data I heard yesterday, everything is-- what they're doing
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.620]   is everything is encrypted on the phone to begin with.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:41.060]   And so if-- or rather, if you have that option enabled, it doesn't even take like four seconds
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.060]   for it to happen.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.980]   It just simply kills the keys that decrypt everything.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.580]   And so there's nothing that can be done with any of the data on there.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.580]   Love it.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   Very, very cool.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   Love it.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   First thing to play with.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   Love it.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.580]   Nice feature.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.280]   What else?
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   I want the compass to do is I want to-- I think most--
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.480]   Compass-- is that something really people want?
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   What is it?
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   What is the point of that?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.680]   I get so much unwanted exercise when I'm trying to walk here saying, "Okay, I know that
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   this dot is over here.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   This means I have to walk west, but I don't know whether west--"
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   What is west?
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.180]   And what in C-street signs.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.580]   "I want the ability to not only have this little blue dot, but also a little blue dot
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.480]   with an arrow saying, 'By the way, you're facing that direction.'"
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   Okay.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.580]   So navigation applications are really going to make a lot of use out of that.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:31.000]   Also the Google Street View does on the G1, on the Android phone, because it knows which
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   way you're looking.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.840]   So you can turn and the street view will change.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.200]   I'd much rather trust the screen than my eyes.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   Where am I?
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.760]   Oh, look at that.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760]   That's a house.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   There's another house.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:47.280]   I know the real test is going to be if you can put one of those little glasses on.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.400]   So you can put the glasses on it and you make it from one part of Petaluma to another without
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.400]   looking at anything.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   The compass of GBS is just telling you where you're at and can you walk west to be hit
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   by a truck?
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.080]   No, because the truck is not on street view.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080]   That's just going to be a--
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.080]   Obviously, a bug.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   I would say a lack of feature.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   I'm guessing if I show up with that rig, I'm probably not going to get that second date.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.920]   I can't look at you because I have to test these three.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.240]   If you look at the look that would give me a second date, then why did we leave our
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   houses to begin with?
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   Did you know I have a compass in my phone?
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   I know.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.720]   That's what I told my wife.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   You are pointing north.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.200]   Voice styling, video, compass.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.200]   She almost laughed when I said compass.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   But you're right.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   There's some useful.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.400]   I mean, it's more like the compass app that I saw, it's not like it has all kinds of cool
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   features.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.880]   It will tell you your coordinates, but it's not like a huge compass application.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   I think that we're going to see it.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   We're kind of imagine.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   It's a big compass app.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.960]   I was surprised there wasn't at least-- since it is giving you latitude and longitude, I
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.960]   was surprised there wasn't a button that simply said, "Please email my location to somebody."
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   Oh, so it will do that.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   I'm just going to tell you that.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:02.520]   Now, what you really need, though, is a hardware software device that reproduces a high spec
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   compass.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:10.320]   It has a hard case, and you flip it open, and it's got the metal site.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.120]   You can mark it in Trishium, so it's glowing softly.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   You can do the whole stuff you're out camping.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   That would be like a camping ring.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.440]   I'm taking eight minutes to find out, "Oh, I'm pointing at this."
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   I made it the sun.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.960]   Yes, it turns out the sun is setting in the west this evening, yes.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.440]   Amazing.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.520]   These new notebooks, anything else to say about them?
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:35.240]   I think they're keeping the least expensive plastic MacBook, but that's the only MacBook
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.320]   left.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   Somebody thought maybe that was speculated.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.760]   Maybe that's a sign that they're going to increase the MacBook one.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   I thought that too.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.800]   Maybe they want to free up that name for something different, or maybe they want to make sure
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.040]   that there is room at the bottom for something new.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   Macpad.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   Yes.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.800]   What were just calling a MacBook?
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.000]   Well, is it not a book?
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.120]   If they were to do, well, I'm not even thinking in terms of that.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.120]   What do you think they'll do?
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   Is like lower net books?
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:03.800]   No, I think it'll run an offshoot or a branch of the iPhone operating system.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.600]   I don't think they'll put the Word Mac anywhere near it.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.960]   Oh, the tablet, yeah.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.600]   But it does mean that they wanted to say, "Look, we basically figured out that we can
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:18.000]   sell $80,600 notebooks immediately to these two educational institutions."
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.800]   So, we will basically keep this really, really dirt cheap looking name for those ones we
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.000]   only make for, we'll build it for you if you want to buy 2,000 of them right now.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   It's not a bad name.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.040]   It is their best selling model is the MacBook.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.800]   Well, I mean, it's the unibody MacBook.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.600]   It also caused confusion.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.200]   I mean, I literally had to start calling the ordinary MacBook the MacBook nothing because
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.400]   I don't make sure people aren't thinking I'm talking about the entire line when I think
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   about something.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.400]   Right.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.200]   I'm not going to get confusion now because now the MacBook Pros have pretty much the same
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.240]   specs as the iMac except, you know, so it's just portable with a different screen.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   I don't wait.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.280]   I like that because what you're saying is we're going to give you power.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.240]   However, we just deliver it to you.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.520]   We're going to give it to you portable or whatever, but it's always going to have some
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   significant power.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.640]   Well, I think the iMac, well, I mean, ask the iMac has, you put a little bit more storage
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.560]   and you've got a couple more connectors in there.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.040]   I mean, we, because we have a lot of my, and it's cheaper for what you get.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.360]   The power you get on iMac is cheaper than the iPhone.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   Than it just being portable.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.840]   But yeah, it's a very powerful machine.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.720]   Anything else from the no ZFS announcement?
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   I was kind of disappointed.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   I'm loving the ZFS.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.280]   That's a great file system.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:30.840]   That's from a son and there is support or there has been support, I think, in server,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.840]   isn't there?
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   But I don't know.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.880]   And there was some notion that maybe an Apple order place, a Jeff S was ZFS.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.440]   I wonder if it was just because how do you really explain that even to a keynote?
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   I know.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.400]   Well, no, developers are going to jump up and cheer.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.560]   They also know that you have this big bank of cameras along the left line.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.840]   And ZFS is a really hard thing to explain to anybody as to why anybody would care about
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   it.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.520]   I think you could say, I think you could say we, it's, you know, we've had HFS for a long
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   time.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.320]   It's been a great file system, but we're in the 21st century and, and, and, and this
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.320]   is what you do.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.080]   And NTFS and HFS are old technology.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.880]   The future is with a more modern file system that has a lot of features, including data
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   robustness that just nothing else can offer.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.440]   And that's why we're moving to ZFS.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   I think that's actually a very compelling argument and it, and it gets you one up on
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.440]   Windows as well.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.800]   Well, and I think a lot of people when you explain to them that what ZFS represents
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:32.840]   is the ability to have a cloud of data where you just plug your drives in and you can
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.720]   pull, pull them out one side and put some of those features are high, you know, the kind
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.280]   of high end features that are harder to explain.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.760]   You just say more data is safer.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.200]   It's, it's built for the future.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   It's built for cloud.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's easier to expand, easier to expand, built in, you know, time machine in effect.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.760]   I mean, there's just, I think that you can explain those features simply enough when
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.800]   you're right, when you start getting into the nitty gritty of what you were just starting
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.360]   to go, go into, it's pretty hardcore.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.160]   But, but, but for anybody who is doing, who, who deals with a lot of data and we end up
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.360]   a lot of data, the idea being able to pull drives out one end and put them in the other
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.160]   end, put bigger drives in the other end, meaning that we never have to worry about whether
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.500]   those DVDs or those old drives hold our data or not, you know, you know, infinitely
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.660]   expandable drives.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   Just amazing.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.660]   Ah.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.960]   So we're, I think we're all pretty happy.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:24.680]   You know, this was one of those keynotes that was satisfying.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.480]   Nobody, nothing knocked you over, but it was satisfying and it did the things that it needed
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.040]   to do.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   I'd say so.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.680]   The iPhone, I'm glad they're taking the GS name off of one of the GS.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.120]   Do you think that's a tip of that to the two GS?
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.920]   I want, if there's a WaaS edition, yeah, it's like a silver WaaS on the back.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.520]   It's got to be a little tip of that.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.040]   I bet WaaS is going to have to like, build, bring like a silver, like permanent marker
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   with them wherever he goes.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.920]   Everyone wants us to have them sign like the back, the black back of it.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   Right.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.840]   They want the WaaS edition of the GS.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.120]   But yeah, I mean, it's, it's as a total package.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.920]   It is incredibly attractive.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:06.640]   I cannot wait to spend just days seeing how fast is this really will allow me to do things
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.920]   that I wouldn't ordinarily do.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.880]   I am exceptionally excited by what developers are going to do when they'd start adding hardware
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.040]   devices that can communicate with.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.280]   I mean, when imagine if the game community got together and said, you know what, we are
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:23.920]   going to develop three reference platform hardware controller devices so that the touch
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.160]   controls are really, really good.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:30.480]   But we're going to basically build a, we're basically going to build a standard like Sony
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.560]   PlayStation like controller or an Xbox type controller.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.240]   We're also going to have one gun controller, you know, and one sports controller that is
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.880]   going to be an open standard that everyone can support so that everybody wants to write
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.320]   stuff for these three, these physical things.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.720]   Those are the sort of things that I love it when I leave a keynote thinking not so much
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.400]   about what I've seen but what's possible.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   Yes.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   That's what I've seen.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   Yes.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.800]   I saw the Xbox demo of their, the, the project.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   Sure.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   The gesture based or whatever.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   It's what it's called.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   But they're right.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   It's the tall, the tall.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   I think it's all right.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.480]   It's a tall, uh, where it's no control in your hands.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.440]   It'll, it'll just do real time, uh, motion capture and basically interpret what you're
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.440]   going there.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.040]   I wasn't thinking about this stupid game where, oh boy, now I finally get to be part
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.680]   of the indie pit crew by having to go.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.680]   That made me laugh.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.280]   I was, I was thinking of just like walking through the living room and just stopping and
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.520]   making couple of just right to get my, my, get my calendar saying, please send that to
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.520]   that guy.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.520]   That's the useful.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   And put onto my iPhone.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.600]   So I, ooh, now I'm like, I, I, I, no kidding.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.240]   I don't get to write about gaming professionally.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.360]   So I haven't actually bought like an Xbox, but I was on Amazon saying how much would it cost
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.600]   for me to own an Xbox?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   You got some time.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   I don't think the towels do out.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   I got some time.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   I got some time.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   No, but I'm thinking, gee, am I going to, should I, should I make sure that if I wanted
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.920]   to have a $400 expense at the end of the year, that I could just simply write that show?
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   Maybe you got till the end of the year to decide.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.520]   You might, you might be right.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.800]   You liked the fact that you can buy movies and books on, on the iPhone, right?
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.760]   Yeah, no, I think that's going to be great.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.880]   Do they get rid of the 10 megabyte?
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.880]   They still have that limit.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   Right.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.240]   But you, so you can buy music, you can buy music and rent movies.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.680]   Solences underneath 10 megabytes.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.040]   On the, on the, on the, on the phone network.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.040]   Otherwise you need to go to wife.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   That's too bad.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.040]   Oh, oh, for the, right.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.560]   Wi-Fi is the world west, but under 10 meg's for, for the 3G network.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.560]   That's too bad.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.400]   Many times you won't be able to sit in a movie in a airport and say, I want to get this
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   money.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.160]   You would run down the battery trying to download it.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160]   I guess so.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   I guess.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   All right.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   Well, thank you guys.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   It's great to see you, Andy.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   Thanks for coming out all this way.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.160]   Are you going to do some Mac breaks while you're out here?
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.440]   I will basically, I'm here all week.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   Try the wheel.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:41.040]   And so much is my love and dedication for this is that I'm willing to shave and be
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.840]   somewhere every single day if you, if you got more ideas for, for, for me to show up
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   on camera.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.520]   Like I was saying on Twitter, it's really, really freaky, not appearing as like Obi-Wan
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.800]   Kenobi, like in spectral form here.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.560]   You're in here, baby.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.560]   He's real.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.560]   He's physical as can be.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.800]   You know, I forgot to do the pics.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   Should we do pics or we do?
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   Do we want to do pics?
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   I've got one ready.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   All right.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   I'll let you go.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   Alex Lindsey, you can start.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.680]   So the one that I'm going to talk about is actually one we used yesterday for the event.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.560]   So one of the things that can be a little complicated and it took us a little while.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.800]   We were looking for streaming software to stream to, to Skype, right, to, to pipe.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.040]   The video in Skype from Conduit.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   So Conduit was on Bill.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:24.920]   So if you saw the, the, the show that we did yesterday, Alex, Justine and Jeff were down
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.440]   at Pixel Core in San Francisco, right near Moscone.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.120]   But we wanted to look like we were right now.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.400]   So you keyed in a beautiful key of Moscone Center behind you.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.640]   It looked just like any TV news set where they're sitting overlooking the Moscone Center.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.920]   I was up here in San Francisco, in Petaluma.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.440]   You skyped in that shot, which looked fantastic.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.400]   Yeah, it looks like another Skype.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.480]   And it wasn't a quick time broadcaster.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   This was the big thing.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.920]   We were trying to figure out how to use quick time broadcast and we couldn't figure this
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   out.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.800]   And so that would have allowed me to pick it up.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.560]   But it was outlay.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.480]   The quick time broadcaster always has this delay.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:03.080]   So I would go to a web endpoint and be able to see your video getting the higher quality,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.080]   perhaps.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.000]   Maybe, but, but this is where Skype excels.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   It's real time.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   It's real time.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.040]   And there's a, you know, that, that two or three second or five or 10 second delay is
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.440]   not acceptable for quick time.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.440]   Not for a conversation.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.680]   We're doing if it's just one end, if I'm just repip your watch in it, that would have been
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:21.720]   totally fine with either case, getting it piped out to that can be complicated.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:25.080]   And so while Condo, it did a great job at doing the keying, how do we get it in there?
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:33.720]   And the program that Marcel actually figured out in the office to use is called cam twist.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.320]   So cam twist and it, this is a for the fast download.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   It's $2.99.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.960]   For the regular download, it's free.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.640]   And so it's not, this is not a big pricey thing that I usually throw at people.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.600]   It is a, it is a great little application.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:55.120]   What it does is it allows you to basically take a video from any screen that you're looking
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.120]   at.
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:01.440]   So whether it's, you know, I can, we just selected literally the window that we want to capture
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.840]   to capture from in Condo it and just drew a little thing around and said pipe that and
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.080]   then make that available as a camera to Skype.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.880]   And so that allowed us to very, very, very easily and cheaply, you know, pipe what was
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.000]   happening in this application to, to Skype or to the internet or to anything.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.440]   Skype just sees it as a video input and just sees it as a video.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   I see that camera.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.440]   Right.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.480]   And one problem with cam twist is it kind of tends to own Skype from that.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.080]   It's kind of hard to get it off.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   It's kind of, I gotta say, no, no, don't use cam twist.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Right.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   It's all right.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.040]   You know, but it, but it, but it, but it was, I think cam twist has been a recommendation
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   on this show now five times.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   Has it?
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040]   I didn't know we recommended it.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.080]   Don McAllister recommended it when he was here.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.960]   I just keep on, well, it's worth recommending.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960]   It's a great program.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.920]   A lot of you will ask me how we did it yesterday.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.200]   And so when I kept on saying it over again, I figured I should, I should say it one more
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.840]   time because cam twist is just, it was, it was, it saved our butt because we really couldn't
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   find.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.560]   Unfortunately, we brought the site to its knees, but right.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560]   We, we, we've ended there.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.800]   Don't go to the camp to Alocinet.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.560]   As, as in life, we must kill everything that we love.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]   Yes.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560]   Exactly.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   So, so anyway, that's, that's it.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.160]   And I don't, you know, it's, it's, if you, if that's the kind of thing you're looking
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.240]   at or trying to play with, I highly suggest it.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   He's great.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   And he's done a great job with it.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   And I've used it for a long time.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.800]   In fact, before we had this fancy switcher set up, I was using cam twist.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.800]   Right.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.800]   And it really works well.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.440]   And I think a number of our participants also use cam twist.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   Good choice.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.680]   Just Google cam twist.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   Yes.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680]   Later.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   Later.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.440]   After the site comes back up.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.040]   Um, you, you have a recommendation, Mr. Enocho?
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.520]   Yes, I do.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   It's from finale.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.960]   The company makes these really high-end professionals.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.120]   You said no to this offer.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.200]   I had a problem a few weeks ago where I was trying to find a copy of a really old song
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.240]   that was like recorded and written and recorded in like 1911.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   And I thought for sure that between all these old record collectors that trying to load
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.440]   up the public domain archives, that find it somewhere.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.480]   I couldn't find it anywhere, but I was able to find the sheet music for it.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.920]   And so I'm like, okay, I've got to remember my four years of piano lessons from, you know,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.240]   from middle school and junior high.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.000]   And the fact that I only had four years shows you how good I was at reading music.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.840]   So I talked to my close personal friend, Chris Brain, who's like Uber music guy at Macworld
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.080]   and in the general world.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.600]   And he recommended he not only to remind me of finale, but he also told me that they
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:27.040]   have a junior edition called finale notepad for just 10 bucks and with a 30 day free trial.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.000]   What it is, it is simple music notation software where if you have like sheet music and you
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.440]   don't know how to read it, you don't know really how to deal with it.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.400]   But as long as you can just basically take a word processor and make, I don't know where
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.120]   any of the cameras are right in front of me.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120]   Oh, cool.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]   It's a camera.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]   Awesome.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   Hello.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   So basically.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   So this is you're going to scan this in.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Well, it's not you do it by the way.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.280]   The name of the song he's holding up is I've got a pain in my sawdust.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.440]   The full title is the plate of the little Bisc doll.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.320]   It really is a horrifying song.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   Where did you find that?
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.160]   It's about, oh, you know, I can't I can't say where I got it from.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160]   It's like 1911.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   And it's a.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.080]   Can you sing that for just sing a couple of the bars?
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.520]   I mean, I can I all got to see the things I don't even know how it goes.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.360]   There's only one thing a tiny Tim recorded in 1960.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.480]   Oh, and I was like, oh, it's a pain.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.160]   It's a small.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.160]   Wow.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.520]   It is a horrifying song about a little toy doll that the complaints about having a pain
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.400]   and keeps asking the doctors to please fix her and they couldn't figure it out.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.480]   And so she dies.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.360]   That literally is like the story at the end of the song.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.360]   She dies.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.800]   Oh, anyway, but back back back to notepad.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.240]   The cool thing is you don't need necessarily to understand music.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.040]   All I have to do is say, OK, you see this right here?
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.680]   What if I were to drop picture of this on the notation software?
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:48.720]   As long as you can make the sheet music that's on the screen look like this by placing the
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   right notes.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   They're right.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.280]   Don't even think about whether quarter notes or 16th notes or whether quarter rest or
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.840]   half rest.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.720]   The little gizmos you see on this put it on this on the on the music bar exactly where
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.400]   they are and exactly the shape they are.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   Then it will simply turn that into actual music.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.000]   You can export it as MIDI.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.800]   I've only got I brought it with me because that sounds great.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   That is really neat.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.520]   I can't believe it turns it in the MIDI.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   I'm excited.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   Oh, I'm so excited about that.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.160]   There have been plenty of times where I don't know how to do that and I want to.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.640]   Hold up to the mic.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.080]   If you can actually get some of the sound and you actually listen to it as you're going.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.320]   So it is almost like ghost music because again, I had no idea what this would really sound
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   like.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.080]   So this is transcribed from the sheet music.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   Right.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.560]   I mean, this is without any human intervention.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.320]   Well, no, with with human intervention.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.920]   This is me basically saying, I'm going to take this sheet of this sheet of music and note
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.160]   for note just basically like, oh, this is doing it by hand.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.320]   This is doing it by hand.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   Can you scan it?
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   You I don't think it.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.160]   No, it doesn't do musical O C. Oh, I misunderstood.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.440]   I thought it was a musical O C.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.760]   Still you get just the ability to.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   Or is it?
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   Oh, sorry.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.000]   Put it on mute for the purposes of.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.120]   All right, everybody now sing along.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.040]   I've got a pain in my sawdust.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.360]   I have a pain in my sort of and if anybody does have like one of these 1910 11 recordings,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.640]   I cannot believe I cannot find it online.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.920]   So I'm sort of going through it paid paid page by page.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.040]   I know nothing about music.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.440]   So oftentimes it's very, very stupefying because I sort of remember from my school years that
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.520]   I was like, okay, too, that's a tide note, which means that you're supposed to hold the
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.640]   keys down supposed to be as one expression.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640]   So it's not going to.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.640]   So how do I use the tie tool?
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.480]   And then there's a help file this so see, well, here's how you use the tie tool.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.800]   Oh, and I literally just click the start here and then stretch it over here.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   And now these three.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   Oh, that's good.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.040]   Now it looks exactly the way it does.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040]   Okay, I'm closer.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.600]   So I bet something like this would be very expensive.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   Ten bucks.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600]   That means a great.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   It's cool.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.480]   The only limitation is that we're asked the real finale software is for if you wanted to
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.200]   do like theme music orchestrations, we got the Fox Orchestra coming into score family
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.680]   guy next week and you need a 20 piece orchestra or orchestration, it'll do that.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.680]   All notepad is just for basically things, pretty much things you could play with two
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.920]   hands on a piano.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   And that's pretty much about it.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.040]   You can't have like now you have a vocal track and now you have a guitar tabs on to it.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.880]   No, it's just for essentially two handed piano music.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.960]   I'm sure one of our listeners who actually knows what they're talking about would be
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.520]   able to know, oh, you're talking about a D diminished, sustainable type notation.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520]   Right.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520]   Exactly.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520]   Exactly.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   I didn't want to confuse all the other listeners, but I knew that you would be smarter to know
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   that.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   This is fantastic.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.760]   It's also fun to play with.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.480]   I mean, it's a lot more fun.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.520]   We have something simple like, again, your third grader brought home something they're
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.440]   supposed to be seeing in the in the corral, you know, and if it's just like one series
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.800]   of notes, you can bang that out in just like a half an hour.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.720]   Then you and you dump it into garage band and you say, well, what if we have this as a
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.480]   bassoon thing to sort of play with the melody a little bit more and it's not so close that
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.120]   you can make sheet music as an entertainment source.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   Right.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.440]   Meaning where you just I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.160]   Just like with Photoshop, it's so easy that I don't know much about photo editing, but
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.760]   I can play with this and have some fun.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   Exactly.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   I'm not getting great results.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   I'm having fun playing with this.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.200]   I don't think it's quite up there yet, but it will and for people who really can't play
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:10.000]   the piano or really have any musical ability, it literally comes down to make this window.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   I'm going to make this window look like this sheet of paper.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.560]   Well, and if there's something that you want to have a MIDI for if you want to have some
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.160]   fun with it and there are a lot of you can buy sheet music for almost any band that you
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.240]   all the police or Genesis or James addiction or whatever you want.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.560]   All of that sheet music's laying around.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.880]   You know, you can buy it and it's just simply a matter of you could turn that into MIDI
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.680]   and make it some weird element in something you're doing.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.480]   If not for commercial purposes, but for your home videos and you want to have the everything
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.800]   she does is magic, but you want to have your own twist on it.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.840]   You know, this would be an easy way to import that instead of just trying to drag things
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.640]   up and down in garage band.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   Right.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   So this is at the finale website.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   You can get this.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.600]   Yeah, it's I believe it's finale music.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   Finale music.com.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600]   Cool.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.600]   Slash notepad.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   Notepad.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:02.920]   Man, there's going to be a lot of transcription is out of work or their life will be a lot easier.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.840]   My pick this week is about an $80 program that we found that solved a very big problem
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   for us.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.040]   One of the things we've been trying to do all along is get these shows recorded in a
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.080]   form that we could upload to YouTube or allow you to add download as an MP3.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.600]   And while we do record the shows, the recording that the TriCaster makes, which is our switcher,
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.360]   is a very high quality MPEG 2 recording.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.760]   So high quality, it's 10 gigabytes an hour.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   Not going to be good for download.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.840]   I don't think anybody's going to want to download that and transcoding something that
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.320]   big takes like eight hours.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.640]   So really kind of put a crimp in our production schedule.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.920]   I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.200]   Elgato came out with a solution for us just I think about a month ago that is perfect.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.560]   So it's a, you know, we output S video.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.160]   That's what goes into the encoders that send it out to the web so you can watch it on the
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   stream.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   It's not super high quality.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   It's not high def.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160]   It's S video.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:01.720]   Elgato makes a inexpensive about $80 USB device that captures S video.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:08.120]   And turns it into a H.264 MPEG-4 file.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   Perfect for uploading.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.800]   In fact, exactly what YouTube wants to have uploaded.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.760]   The quality is excellent.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.320]   It's recording right now.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.240]   It records onto a network drive so we can actually record it to an FTP site where people
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   can have it.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.560]   When you're done recording, it has a little trim function, which QuickTime does it also,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   but it's built in.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.760]   So you can find the beginning and the end, finish it up and then pack it out.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.720]   It does a great job of real time recording.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.320]   The quality is as good as you're going to get, you know, short of this MPEG-2, which
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.600]   nobody can watch.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.400]   But if I transcoded the MPEG-2, it would look just like that anyway.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   Right.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.000]   So this is a, this is, and for $80, this is great.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.760]   Now I've usually kind of eschewed the USB encoders.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   You know, you know, we use Firewire, you know, the Canopus 110, 300 and 700.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.400]   These are, you know, hundreds of dollars and they have Firewire output.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   Yeah, they do a great job, but this doesn't chop everybody's good real time encoding.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.120]   I guess now we've got processors that are fast enough to do this.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.280]   So it's, it's got a very generic name, which is not going to help you, but if you go to
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.440]   the Elgato site, you'll see it.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.600]   It's called Elgato Video Capture, eLgatio.com.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.560]   It's under $100 and it does a great job.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.040]   So if you've got video, S-video or composite video that you want to record, this would
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   be suitable for recording from a VCR, for instance, it solves our problem.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.140]   And you're going to be able to, now we're going to be able to give you downloadable
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.440]   MPEG-4s in the near future of all of our shows and we could put them on YouTube too,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   which is even better.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   That's my thing.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   Great.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.900]   And the video quality looks great.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.400]   It's doing a great job.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.560]   I would say it's as good as the master recordings, you know, the video that we're looking at.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   It doesn't look soft.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.800]   It's, it's doing a great job.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   So we're very happy.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.600]   And it's, you know, I'm doing this on the same machine that I do a lot of other things.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.640]   So it doesn't take a lot of cycles to do this encoding.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.180]   But I bet if I use the Turbo H.264, which I think I made a pick a couple of weeks ago,
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.260]   that's the USB key from Elgato.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.020]   By the way, I did some time tests because you were wondering what the time difference
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.020]   was.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:11.980]   It's twice as fast on my MacBook Pro to encode from, say, I think I was using Matryshka or
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   an MKV file into a H.264, double the speed with that with the USB key.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.740]   If the big, big difference.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.700]   And by the way, another thing that speeds up solid state drive, you were the one who told
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.160]   me that the solid state drives you make a big deal.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]   It's so fast.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.780]   So I'm really getting some lickety split much faster than real time encoding.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.920]   Okay, there's our picks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.080]   And now we're going to leave you with tiny Tim.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.960]   Oh, the name is the only color I've got to pay you my sword.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   This is the song.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   Sorry, why did you say so?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   Thank you.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   The name is the song is I've got to pay you my sword.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   Oh, thank you.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:58.060]   This is all I've got to pay you my sword.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.860]   A little bit tall and a little rigged.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:05.140]   All and the dali imported from France.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:12.660]   We're sitting one day on the shelf of the store with a doll that could wind up and dance.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:19.900]   And all of a sudden the shopkeeper heard a scream that rang out through the store.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.060]   And this was the flange of the little discharge.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:27.260]   Have made such an awful lot more.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.100]   (crowd cheering)
