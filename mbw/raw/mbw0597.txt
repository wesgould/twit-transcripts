[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   I will later in the show attempt to rip this cord from the back of the HomePod.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000]   Mirth and hilarity will ensue, but now I don't know if it's back in right.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And we'll give you our review of the HomePod a whole lot more.

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   With Renee HomePodRitchie from imore.com in his home pod.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I am.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm podded in my homely right now.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm just putting in.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I see your white home pod over your right shoulder.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's nice.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yes.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yeah, I got a white one.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Dauropol got a black one.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I don't know how they decided that.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I got a black one.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Well, I bought it.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's how I decided.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Okay.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Give your master of your own destiny.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I gave them $350 and I said here.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Give me the black one.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Also, here in Ani and I cover the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Heidi Ho.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Heidi Heidi Ho.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, I've been listening to the home pod.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's one of those things where it's hard to read all the reviews and understand what you're going to get here.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   You almost have to go list.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Did you see the Reddit one, Leo?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Did you see the Reddit?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I did.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   That's one I'm going to point to.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It's in the audio file subreddit.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I saw that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Isn't it amazing that Reddit is now doing better work than Consumer Reports?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, I'll be honest.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm not sure they're doing better work yet.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   By the way, the reason you said that is because Consumer Reports said it wasn't as good as the Google Home Max.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Well, they said they were going to take a while and have to test it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And this guy just did it.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He went home.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He set up all this crazy nerd equipment and he just, he just ran his tests.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And it's like we're moving from the new media to new real media.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   But yeah.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   But yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Okay.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Well, he did his tests in his own room and you know, it wasn't.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So you got to understand what you're getting.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He says, "I am speechless.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   The HomePod actually sounds better than the KEF X300A.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Now the KEF, which is a very nice speaker, is roughly the same size as the HomePod.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And his measurements didn't measure anything subjective like stereo speakers versus a single speaker.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So I'm guessing if you set somebody down in front of two KEFs with the HomePod in the middle,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   they're going to prefer the KEFs just because they're right.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He has this really good takeaway that he put both in this post and in the later one that
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   he wrote.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.620]   And he's saying, if you are an audiophile and you sit there and you get a really good
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.400]   sound system and you set it up and you measure the room and you make it, like your room is
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.000]   well done and you do everything, it's going to sound way better.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.600]   But if you just want to drop something into your kitchen or your living room and it's not set up
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.160]   and it's got weird layouts and this will sound as good as is possible with you doing zero
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   effort at all.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:06.480]   He tested it in an untreated room with, as far as I can tell, tested it properly.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.720]   But I think really the thing that I would say to somebody considering it is the simple
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.920]   caveat for what it is.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.280]   They never add that.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.880]   It sounds great for a speaker its size, that kind of thing.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.840]   I think it says you have to have an iPhone or an iPod iPad.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.880]   You have to listen to Apple music pretty much exclusively.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   It's not a Bluetooth speaker, you can't really use it as a phone speaker although we were
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.280]   able to get the phone audio out of it via AirPlay.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.680]   It doesn't have the microphone channel.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.360]   Yeah, when you do the phone, it doesn't have bass bands, it can't work as its own phone.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   But if you have a phone call, it'll show up just like AirPods will or speaker phone
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   will in the phone.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.160]   It doesn't use the mic on the HomePod, so it's not really a speaker phone.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   You still have to talk into the phone.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.240]   And there's a delay and that's one of the things.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   And also, Google Home doesn't have a bass band, or GSM radios, the Amazon product doesn't
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   do.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.160]   But they let you connect through at least a desktop app so that I can at least do a voice
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.480]   call that's not through phone lines.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:25.240]   I want to reserve judgment in terms of the pure numbers until stereo review or sound
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   and vision.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.880]   Yeah, but is that really useful?
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   It is.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.280]   It's totally subjective.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.760]   But that's the point is this guy's measurements are also totally objective.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.480]   They don't include the...
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.520]   But I'm always a little bit not suspicious, but I put them at sort of a lower rate.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.880]   They can be done very scientifically by people with superb credentials.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.920]   But if it's not a difference that you can hear, it's useless.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.000]   Or if it's not a difference that applies to the music that you like to listen to, it's
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   useless.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.640]   And even if the HomePod is an inch and a half too tall to be on the shelf where you really
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.360]   want it to be, that's also a factor.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.760]   I don't have one for long-term testing yet, but I have had experience with it, of course,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.560]   in the last week.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   And I found that the thing...
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   There's a lot that I loved about it.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.240]   And I'm going to be putting off my real review until I get one in the house for at least
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.800]   two or three weeks.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.040]   But the things that disappointed me were things like software and things like being
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.680]   able to ask for a certain artist and for Siri to absolutely understand what artist I was
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.040]   talking about or what genre I was talking about.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:44.280]   So the audio is, quality is subjective, but overwhelmingly positive reviews.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   It's the software side of things that make me wonder if I have the $120 smart speaker
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.680]   that's smarter, but while we're a speaker, when I'd rather talk to that thing and just
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.040]   simply be listening to my David Bowie quickly as opposed to playing 20 questions.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.680]   Like, "Okay, Shlomo, I'm thinking of an artist.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.080]   He's a male artist in the 70s.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   Glam, yes, with this artist be noted for his work in the theater."
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.000]   He did appear in some movies and one-stage performance.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Is it Gary Glitter?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.400]   No, it's not Gary Glitter.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   Stop.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.240]   Let me interrupt you just a sec so we can get out there.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.200]   I would do the opposite, which is I think it's accepted.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.840]   Everybody agrees.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.200]   His mediocre has very severe limitations because it's an Apple-only device, but Apple's not
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   selling it that way.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   They're selling it as a speaker.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.480]   So I think the only really thing to talk about is how good a speaker it is.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.920]   I guess I would agree with everybody.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.120]   It's good for what it is.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   Apple's done a very, very good job.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.400]   They have Tom and Son Holman, the creative THX is among their many, many great engineers
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   on their team.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.040]   This is the flat response curve.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   It's very flat.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.960]   That's not what you're going to hear because it has a loudness curve applied to it.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   What you want?
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.200]   Renee, would you agree that, given that you've had it for a while, that this is, I think
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.920]   it's a great speaker for people who want music as wallpaper as part of their life.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.360]   It is not a great speaker for people who want to listen to music.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.240]   I think, you know, so the way I put it in my not a review is that if you are all in on
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.360]   the Apple ecosystem and you have Apple music and you just want to be able to take a speaker
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   and drop it anywhere and it will sound really good no matter where you drop it, then this
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.640]   is a speaker for you.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.920]   If there's a room that doesn't have audio and you don't want to futs with it, if you
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.520]   want to move a speaker from room to room, you don't want to do any of those things.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.320]   If you value quality through ease of use, then this is a really good speaker.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.440]   I just feel like Apple's kind of pushing the notion that this is that, and I bought
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.200]   into it initially until I got one, that because of computational audio, this speaker is a
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.680]   bigger end, you know, it's the new way of being.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.040]   Now admittedly you can't pair it so it's not stereo, but when your audio file is losing
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.320]   their stuff over what's happening with the speaker, I can't understand that at all, but
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   I've read several audio files now.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.360]   I can't believe they're doing this or they're modeling this or they're able to reflect that.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.080]   So there's some science here that's really interesting.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.880]   They're doing smart things, yeah.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.840]   Yes, and stuff that we'll see propagate across the industry, I hope.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.000]   I mean, the loudness curve means it isn't, it's subjectively sounds good, but it's not
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.240]   subjectively perfect.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.160]   The fact that they're able to get a great bass at a very high level because they're
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.400]   preventing distortion, they're actually limiting how loud it can get.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.360]   And this is an interesting thing in the measurement.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.840]   He was able to see the speaker, he says, "Such tight control on bass from within his speakers
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.000]   unheard of in the audio industry."
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.560]   But that's because you have an A8 processor in here.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:10:00.520]   So they're eliminating harmonic distortion from over driving the woofer.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   It's impressive, yes.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   My new favorite word.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yeah, I love the Fletcher Munson curve, but I actually like how that sounds, but that
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.520]   is a modification of the sound to, and some of this is, well, how's it mixed?
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   Is it mixed for that?
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   Or how did the engineer in the studio mix it, et cetera, et cetera?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.720]   I guess I don't want people to think that this is the greatest speaker ever made.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720]   It's a beginning.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   It is nowhere near.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.040]   I think that this is a product that's tailor made for Apple's really good two-week return
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   policy.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.720]   And this isn't because it's potentially a bad product.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   It's just that it's going to be, I can't think of any other Apple product that has
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.920]   been so highly subjective.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   It's not just for the sound quality, but also...
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   It's like wine.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   It's wine.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.080]   Also, there are some people that can appreciate a thousand dollar phone.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.360]   There are some people that they will never get more use out of.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   They will never be able to get the full thousand dollars worth of usage out of a thousand dollar
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   phone.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.520]   A $650 phone is just fine for them and they will never notice any difference between the
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.000]   cheaper one, the more expensive one.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.600]   So that's what I'm talking about when I say that it's a really, really good one to buy
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.000]   under Apple's two-week return policy because at the end of a week and a half, you'll either
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.080]   get a sense that I never want this out of my living room ever again or out of my kitchen
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.480]   ever again or out of my bedroom ever again.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.560]   Or you'll say, "Wow, that really does sound great, but it's not doing more for me than
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.800]   my old smart speaker or my $200 Bluetooth speaker that I bought a couple of years ago."
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   And that's fine.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.760]   So that's what people are going to have to decide for themselves.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.800]   There are small speakers that some say sound better.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.320]   In fact, as you point out, Renee, the consumer reports in their preliminary testing said,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.360]   it's maybe edged out a little bit by the most direct competition, which is the Sonos One
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   with Alexa.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.680]   Only people I've ever heard that say, we've had Neelie Patel listen to it, Jim Dalrymple,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.080]   I've listened to it, Serenity listened to it, Reddit listened.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.720]   I mean, there's so many people and they, not that it's the world's most fantastic speaker,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.960]   but just that the Google Max is very basic and very unidirectional.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.640]   It sounds like consumer reports was sort of not just dropping them in a room to test them,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   but putting them in very specific, well, we'll see.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.880]   I mean, I'm not a big fan of consumer reports anymore.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   Not because of Apple.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.600]   I think their Microsoft and their Samsung reviews are terrible too.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.160]   But I'm eager to see more people now when they get their hands on them.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.520]   And the thing I like is that I think it's solid hardware.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.760]   And yes, Siri is ridiculous.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.960]   Like Clayton Morris, a friend of the show Clayton Morris, he sent me a thing saying,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.760]   "I can't get it to play the Beatles One album."
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.640]   And I asked for it and it played immediately.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.960]   And we exchanged voice messages.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.520]   And his request, like he sent me, queued my Siri to play it properly.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.240]   And my request queued his to play it properly.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.600]   But when he asked it wouldn't play.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   And that's the sort of thing.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   When I asked it for classical music, it played hip hop.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.440]   It was old school hip hop, but it was not what I was thinking.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.640]   Well, Leo, that's because we're getting...
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.680]   Clearly, but clearly it's influenced by your Apple music choices.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   It's very...
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   But that's a good thing, right?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   It's individualized.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.560]   I got the Super Mario soundtrack because my God kids have been asking Apple music so much
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   for it.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.880]   But I turned that off.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.400]   You can go into Siri and say turn off music influence.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.960]   And then that doesn't happen anymore.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   I really...
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.000]   That is a worry to me that it pays off your long-term investment in Apple music.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.240]   So if you've been feeding information about your personal taste and the stuff that you
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.440]   tend to ask for, if you give it an oddball request of something that while he has never,
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:38.760]   ever asked for Tahitian Funk, electro dance EDM before, I'm guessing that I misheard him.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.520]   I'll try to find that I'll use the second or third most likely match for what he asked
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.080]   for.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   It's a good payoff for people who have been in the system for a long time, but it does...
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.720]   It's kind of a bummer that it can't do that smart...
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.400]   That kind of smarts independently of the user.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.600]   That people who are just signing up for Apple music after canceling their subscription two
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.640]   years ago are going to rush into these problems and they're going to feel more angry about
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   having to use Apple music if it's not even working correctly for them.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.080]   It has eight amplifiers, which is very interesting.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.360]   Each speaker has its own amp, which is the right way to do it, but no one does that in
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.400]   a speaker this size.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   That's insane.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   It's amazing.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.320]   It's engineeringly interesting.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yeah, very interesting.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.520]   The I fix a pterodone on this, which I'm sure we'll get to, is just...
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   I'm just so much even more impressed by how this thing is made, by how well...
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.560]   For something that is not meant to be taken apart by anybody ever, for something that costs
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.640]   $280 to fix or replace by Apple service.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.120]   Man, is this thing a beautiful thing on the inside.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.240]   Some would dispute that they maybe were more aggressive in tearing it down than they needed
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   to be.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.840]   For instance, they took an exacto knife to the fabric and somebody said, "Oh, you don't
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   have to do that."
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   No, they didn't.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   They didn't.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   No, they didn't.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   They took a hack saw.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   Yeah, they had...
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.400]   I saw the video and they seem to be undoing a drawstring.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:16.200]   There was another video by the What's Inside this YouTube channel that just cuts things
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   in half.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   Okay.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Okay.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.800]   That's weird because they'll have to check the video.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.360]   I think another video found the drawstring.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   What I'm saying is that they may have been a little more aggressive in tearing it apart
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.560]   than they needed to be.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.000]   However, they did give it a one out of ten for repairability and I think given that they
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.720]   had to take a hack saw to it at one point, that may be the actual...
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.640]   The video I saw, which I remember being I fixed off the double-check it, they had to
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   use heat guns to undo glue to get at the place where you actually get to the screws.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.800]   There was a point in which they found they could not figure out how to separate the top
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.960]   of the shell from the bottom of the shell and so finally in frustration they did hack
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   saw it.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   But they also found evidence inside that they thought meant that it was meant to be unscrewed
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.440]   but then they might have decided to use glue instead.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   Right.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.040]   In any event, you're not going to take it apart.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.240]   The cost of repairing it, if you bring it to Apple, is 80% of the total cost, like it's
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   $280.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   So don't break it.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   Don't drop it.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   Don't touch it.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:27.480]   If you have a white one, really don't touch it, especially with those hot sauce fingers.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.080]   The other one that I thought was interesting is the dispute over whether this cable is
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   removable.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.560]   It looks like it's normal into the back of the device.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.000]   It doesn't look like it has a plug but a couple of people, including 9-5 Mac, took
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.120]   their home pot in their own hands and yanked it out.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.600]   In fact, there is a connector.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.080]   It's just very tightly attached.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.440]   I wouldn't recommend doing that because at some point you're going to yank the wire out
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   of the connector.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   Should I do it?
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   I don't know.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   Also, I imagine it has to do with shielding otherwise that's the most important thing.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   It's natural thing in the world to make that detachable.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.200]   There you go.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.840]   You broke the speaker and the microphone.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.280]   Are you happy now?
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.760]   It came out with some effort and I hit the microphone and knocked it down, but it did
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.400]   come out.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.800]   So there you go.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   It does come out.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.400]   And now if you're next trick, get it back in and if it works.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   Yeah, I am.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.600]   It's so hard to pull it out.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   My hand.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   So it does come out.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   I'll verify that.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.840]   I wouldn't recommend it given how hard I had to pull that.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.520]   In order to get it back in, so I already had to use the edge of a table to push it right
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   and get it back in.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520]   It doesn't go right back in.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   Oh, well.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.280]   At this point, we have to wire a wonderful football.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   Don't break this, by the way, because it's so--
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.080]   You can get 30 bucks for it, Leo.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   I got a soldering iron.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   Look at what they did.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.280]   Look at the eye-fixing folks.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.040]   They really had to really kind of destroy it.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   It looks like--
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.240]   That mesh makes a wonderful giant kiwi.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.680]   But there's a lot of technology in here.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.280]   It's really very impressive.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.200]   There's nobody would say it doesn't sound great.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   It sounds great.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   Exactly.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.120]   I'm not saying it doesn't sound great.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.520]   It sounds great.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.200]   Does it sound better than anything else you can get in that size of price point?
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.240]   I haven't heard every speaker in that size of price point.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.600]   I can tell you this.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.400]   It doesn't sound as good as my home stereo.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.200]   So I put it in the middle of my home stereo and I listened to a variety of music.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:31.480]   And my home stereo is more spacious, more detail, clearer, crisper.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   It's like tasting wine.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   I understand.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.640]   To my taste.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.960]   I think if you want-- that's why I say it's for people who want to have music in their
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.560]   environment, not people who want to listen to music.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.720]   Both you and Renee together have made really good points there that I didn't-- when I--
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.200]   again, I've had some experience with it.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.160]   I have nothing that amounts to having it in my home day after day after day hour.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   I did notice with a couple of pieces of music that I usually test audio with because I'm
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   so familiar with how these tracks work.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.520]   Of course, I didn't notice as many details as with my home stereo system.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.680]   But remember with the home stereo system, I have to be sitting at a certain point between
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   the speakers.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.480]   I have no doubt that would sound better if I were just anywhere in the living room as
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.880]   opposed to sitting-- actually, to get the maximum listening, I actually have to move
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.960]   a chair to get the-- really in that sweet spot where I really do appreciate the entire
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   sound field.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.280]   So just like Renee said, and just like you're saying, it's not necessarily for someone who
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.920]   would be spending even $500 on a stereo and a pair of speakers.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.960]   It's a really great choice for people who want-- who are okay with whatever uni-- you
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.600]   single sound source they've got, but they want it to sound amazing no matter where you
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.840]   are inside the house or in the room.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   And you know what's really good for?
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.000]   Voice sounds as good on it as anything.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.720]   As anything I've tried to play voice on.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.120]   So if you're listening to audio books or if you're listening-- in fact, what you'll
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.880]   hear is more defects in some of the audio book recordings.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.200]   If you're listening to podcasts, ours have no defects.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.760]   I listened to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   It sounded phenomenal.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   It's great for that.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.320]   It's great for that.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.480]   It's great for that.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   And you know what?
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.960]   To me, the best thing about all of these voice-enabled speakers is it's the best thing that ever
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   happened to podcasts.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.720]   It makes it so easy.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.160]   Not just ours, but to anybody's to listen to podcasts.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.120]   I used to listen to podcasts on my Apple TV.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.080]   I found that if the podcast is coming out of my computer, then it's distracting.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.520]   I can't work while it's on.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.240]   But if it's just ambiently in the room, then it doesn't really bother me.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.680]   So I used to do the Apple TV, but then it was coming from like the sound bar in the
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   surround system.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   And now it just comes from the HomePod.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.160]   And it's enough that I can listen when I want to, but it's never like smashing voice
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   into my face.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.320]   So let me ask, by the way, don't use this as computer speakers.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   There is some built-in latency intentionally, apparently, because of airplay.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.760]   You mentioned trying to use it with your Apple TV as a home theater speaker.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.840]   Again, latency is going to kill you.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   The lip sync.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.160]   I haven't noticed any latency with that.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   So I've like, and I've said, my mom has a Samsung cable box and we plug it into her
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.520]   Samsung television and the voice is never in sync.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.120]   And I have not been able to fix it.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.400]   I just choose the AirPlay target and it handles everything.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.760]   And the voices are perfectly in sync and I don't have to worry about it.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.960]   And it stays stuck there until I do something else.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.520]   And as far as I know, Apple's AirPlay team, Apple TV team and HomePod team work their
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.880]   but soft to make that so.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.160]   So AirPlay has some known latency.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.800]   And when we tested it, it was maybe half a second or a second.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.640]   But remember that a lot of receivers do compensation knowing that there's going to be some latency.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.200]   When Apple controls a whole widget like with Apple TV and HomePod, they can make sure
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   that they're not up.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.320]   I don't think it's ideal for that, frankly.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.000]   I think, you know, get a home theater in a box.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.760]   There's a lot of ways to do this that are probably better.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.320]   But if you want to have all your speakers.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.280]   Well, if it's all you have, if you want to have a speaker in your apartment or you're,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.440]   you know, if you have a studio or you have a kitchen and you want it to sound good no
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.120]   matter where you are in that environment, this is probably the best choice for you.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   And I want to think about it.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   And one thing that I used to do.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.160]   Well, it sounds expensive is actually not expensive for this.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.560]   I don't think for what you get.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.960]   And one of the things I always wanted to do, like I sit there looking at stuff on my iPad.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.920]   And the iPad speakers have gotten really good, but they didn't used to be good at all.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.040]   And I always wanted to airplay to the Sono speaker behind my bed.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.640]   And I would just sit there and watch the thing and they just never provided airplay.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.880]   And now I did this with the HomePod.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.080]   I just moved the audio there and I sat there and I finally had what I really wanted.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.000]   Washing on my iPad, listening to the music on a better speaker.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.440]   Now, so having said all of that, and we've just started second week covering it, but
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.080]   I've had it now for a few days, so I want to get my two cents in.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.760]   The real question I have is what are Apple's intentions?
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.640]   What are your intentions, Apple?
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.000]   And you had the briefing with them.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.040]   I know they didn't address this at all.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.520]   But will they make larger ones?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.080]   Will they incorporate this technology into other stuff?
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   Will there be a sub?
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.880]   The team that worked on this, they work on a range of products.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   So they worked on the iPads, speakers on the iPad Pro.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720]   They worked on the AirPods.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.320]   They have a bunch of little teams that do projects like this.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   I think this is them testing the waters.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.960]   And as we've seen now, we have a variety of iPhones on the market.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   We have a variety of iPads on the market.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.760]   We had a variety of iPods on the market.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.200]   And I don't know what they'll do next.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.160]   I would love a home theater bar with this technology, for example.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.040]   There's an A-Maple, Home Camelcase Theater, or Home Camelcase Bar, either one of those.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.960]   And there's a lot of other things.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.160]   A mini maybe for people who really want a small kids room, or a dorm room, or something.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.200]   They don't need the big ones.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.160]   So I think there's a lot of room to scale this technology.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.840]   The advances I really want, though, are all software-based.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.240]   It's just stuff like adding SiriKit for audio so that you can choose to listen to Spotify
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   instead of Apple music.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.640]   And making Apple-- I'll say how much does Home Camelcase cost?
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.320]   And it'll say it costs $350.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   How much does AirPods cost?
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   I don't know.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   You have to ask Apple.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.020]   Making things consistent, I think, is the biggest thing they could do to improve home
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.840]   pod experience right now.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.440]   I really think that even just finding a way to make something that's as good as this for
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.320]   a hundred bucks less in a year or two is going to really change the game.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.720]   Because I think that will put it into what the hell, why not, mode.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.240]   And it'll also mean that people might want to be eager to buy two of these or put them
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.520]   throughout the house.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.240]   The question is that whether they've got a vector for this that's similar to the Apple
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.120]   Watch or where-- the Apple Watch or the iPhone where they know that, well, we don't really--
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.760]   we don't have everything that's-- we haven't implemented everything we put on the whiteboard
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.600]   yet, but that's coming as soon as we spend some more time on it and see if people use
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   it.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.200]   Or whether it's on more of an Apple TV vector where this exists to help justify our iTunes
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   store.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.280]   It's going to be OK, decent hardware.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.280]   It's not going to be exciting.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.160]   We're going to make sure it maintains pace with whatever else is out there, but we're not
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.200]   going to be-- we're not terribly excited about it.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.280]   So if they go an Apple TV route, OK, they'll still be a nice speaker.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   But if they find a way to make a $300 version of this, if they find a way to make three
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.560]   or four of these work together in ways as yet unimagined, then, oh boy, would like to
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   see it.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   But first, please make Siri smarter.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.840]   So we're going to take a break.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.480]   When we come back, there's still lots of other things to talk about, including the biggest
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.240]   leak in Apple history.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.000]   It's like a leak, like an onion leak, Leo?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Like, you got some of the market.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Yeah, giant leak.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.160]   A giant leak.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.800]   I want to make-- makes me want to make soup for some reason or a cancer role.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   Yes.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.600]   Do they-- they must cook with leaks in Montreal a lot, right?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.160]   It's a very French thing to do.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.160]   I love leaks.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   I love leaks.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.160]   I'm not a lot of leaks.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.160]   I'm hungry.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   I'm hungry for leaks now.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.640]   If you're in the business of hiring, you-- you know, congratulations.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.240]   You have the most important job in the country and the company.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   You didn't know that, did you?
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   Actually, you knew that.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.200]   The boss doesn't know it unless you're the boss.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.720]   The person who hires the company is really building the company.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.040]   Human piece by piece.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.640]   A company is just that.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.840]   Made of people.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.640]   The best people can bring your company to the moon or Mars in the case of Elon Musk.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.120]   The worst people can bring your company to its knees, as in the case of, I don't know,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   Uber.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.800]   It's a really, really important job, is all I'm saying.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.880]   And I've got a way to do your job better.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.480]   Something better than just posting it online and praying for the right people to see it.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.520]   Zip Recruiter, a platform that finds the right job candidates for you.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.000]   Zip Recruiter, you post on Zip Recruiter.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.720]   We always mentioned this before, and it goes to 100 plus job sites.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.040]   But I think the underlying technology is even more interesting.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.080]   Zip Recruiter learns what you're looking for, identifies people with the right experience,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.440]   and then invites them to apply for your job.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.360]   Getting the right person has always been an issue of getting to where the people are and
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.160]   letting them know you have a job and saying, "Come, apply to the job."
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.000]   These invitations have revolutionized how you're going to find your next hire.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.200]   80 percent of employers who post a job on Zip Recruiter get a great quality candidate
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.440]   through Zip Recruiter in one day.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.680]   Imagine.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.000]   You find out somebody's leaving today and tomorrow you've got their replacement.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.080]   Zip Recruiter doesn't stop there.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.600]   They even spot the strongest applications you receive.

[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   Thank you so much for making Mac Break Weekly possible.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.080]   The iPhone source code, it's called the I boot source code.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.960]   That's not Canadian, don't make any jokes.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.360]   I boot.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.520]   Jonathan Levin who has written a series of book on iOS and Mac OS X internals.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:31.960]   Told the motherboards, Lorenzo Francescie Bicare, Bicare, that it is the worst leak
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.600]   in Apple history because now Apple's response is, hey look at the, it's old.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.480]   This is from 2014.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.760]   But this is important because I boot is how iOS starts.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.080]   And if you have the source code, you can look for ways to jailbreak a phone, to hack a phone,
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.200]   maybe even to get into the secure enclave.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   Is that correct?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.720]   I don't know about the secure enclave specifically, but yeah, people, everyone from jail breakers
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.640]   to security researchers, two people who are potentially interested in finding exploits
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.280]   for less notable reasons could look through this and potentially find a bug.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.520]   There's no telling if that bug has already been fixed because this is I boot from iOS
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.400]   9, which is two versions ago.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   There's no guaranteeing that that target is still in the same place.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.520]   But it is not good that this got out.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.400]   So I should have, I'm not a big believer in insecurity through obscurity.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.280]   I think that Apple, and I think Apple would echo this, that their code has to be bulletproof
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.240]   whether somebody knows what it is or not.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.280]   But in fact, a layer of security is just one more thing to go through.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.120]   Levin knew it was the real deal when it was posted on GitHub because he'd already disassembled
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.280]   the iBoot code so he could look and compare his disassembly.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.440]   But he says it may bring back jailbreaking because jailbreaking has been thwarted by
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:51.720]   Apple's fixes in the past, but now there'll be new ways to look.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.520]   And jailbreaks now are the multi-factor.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   Like it's not just, oh, here go, there's a TIFF and jailbreak, your iPhone, like in the
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.000]   glory days of the first iPhone.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.440]   Now, like you really need an exploit here, an exploit there, chain these things together,
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.720]   get access to them.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.200]   It's an ongoing rolling process and who knows.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.240]   This is not anything that anyone with an iPhone today has to worry about.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.840]   It's not like this code was put up and tomorrow someone's hacking into your iPhone.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.360]   It's very much a big information dump right now.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.000]   But the positive side of this, if there is one, it's the same thing when the obscurity
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.360]   layer was pulled off of the secure enclave.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.240]   It's that researchers can get in as well.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.040]   And Apple has a bug bounty program and people can find things in there and report them.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.800]   And that makes the code better for everybody.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.520]   So I'm always of two minds of these things.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.920]   Probably better if they never leak, but once they are leaked, at least we have a chance
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   at better security.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.640]   Yeah, this was apparently a low level employee.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.680]   I don't know why he had access to it who shared it with his friends and then his friends
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:51.840]   posted it, ended up being on post on GitHub where Apple immediately filed a takedown request.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.520]   And it's don't go looking for it.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   It's gone.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.160]   Although I imagine people saved it.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.120]   I think it's fun to look at source code.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.920]   I think that's fascinating, frankly.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   Totally.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.960]   And I don't want to say that Apple is naive, but I mean, they they are very open and embracing.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.720]   And I remember the person who went to Apple as an intern and was asked to port the OS 10
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.040]   code to ARM processors, published it as a university paper.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   Right.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   And that's how all that got out.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   Right.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   And it's not that like I'm sure Apple's secrecy is like, Oh gosh, when someone shows up there
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.640]   and they're like, there's something cool for you to work on.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.760]   They're often not sort of mean or malicious about who gets access to what security.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   Security.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.160]   It's always been said security is layers, right?
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   There's layers of security.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   Yes.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   This is better.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.120]   One of those layers can be security through obscurity.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:41.280]   You certainly don't want to just say, Hey, look at our code in general.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.800]   But it's not the end of the world.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   If it gets out to Apple didn't encrypt this code, right?
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.600]   I mean, it's not something you can easily get to.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.320]   So it's for iOS nine.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.560]   And so Apple says we don't care.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   It's iOS nine.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.240]   Although I've seen debate among the hackers about how often I boots source code would be
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.920]   changed because it's so critical to it.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.640]   You know, if it's working and it's reliable, you may not want to change it too much anyway.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   And it's interesting how it got out.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   I mean, it was an intern who then shared it with five friends who were in the intern.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.920]   Oh, we're in the intern scene and we're really curious about it.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.360]   And then they decided they were going to keep it and not share it with anybody.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.920]   But then the years went by.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.360]   They be, I'll just share it with this person and that person.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.000]   And then they quote was, we shared it with somebody we shouldn't have.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And that's interesting.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's like an on Reddit.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.880]   But why did an intern have access to if this is the thing?
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.760]   Family jewels, why did the intern have access to it?
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.240]   And again, I mean, it sounds like it's naive, but there's often somebody who's given a project
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   to work on in that part.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.160]   This is part of what they're called or they figured out how to get access to it outside
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   their product.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   Right.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.440]   A lot of times, you know, I was talking on iOS today about why people don't like source
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   code delete.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   Of course, there's a security issue.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   But a lot of times it's just embarrassing.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.400]   You know, the comments or the, or there's some little crappy go to somewhere that you
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.960]   just don't want anybody to see because you just.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.600]   There was.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.240]   There was a great story from Don Melton because he was put in charge of cleaning up the Netscape
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.960]   source code before on open source in Mozilla.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.640]   And he got that job because he knew the most curse words and they were using those as line
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   breaks.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   I love it.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.400]   There's a third reason, of course, proprietary code, but I boot probably has no proprietary
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.240]   code owned by others or whatever.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.040]   I wouldn't guess.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.160]   One in 10 notebook shipped worldwide last year was a Macbook.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   That's not bad.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   10%.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.320]   This is according to trend force.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.400]   Apple surpassed Asus to become the world's fourth largest notebook vendor.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.820]   9%, 9.6% market share.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.320]   That's where that one in 10 comes from.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   Learning double digits.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   Oh boy.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.760]   HP's number one actually HP's really been dominant for the last few years.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.440]   Followed by Lenovo also number two for three years running Dell.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.280]   Asus, which is now flip flopped with Apple.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.920]   Apple has taken over as the number four manufacturer.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.080]   It's always different.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   This is all laptops.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.160]   When you look at the premium market, then it's different numbers set for Apple.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.280]   Apple's has why they say you were computers and more money and not more computers and
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   less money.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.840]   Apple's perfectly content being number four.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.160]   They're not four.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   Number one in money.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.640]   And that's what matters kids.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   That's how you score this game.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   I think Andy's muted.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   Oh.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.760]   Thanks for waving at us.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:42.240]   I'm not my microphone wasn't muted.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.520]   Oh, it was muted.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.520]   Carson.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.240]   Maybe you didn't try to say anything.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Okay.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.080]   Well, no, I was I was starting to feel like a little bit hurt.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.440]   Oh, no, no, no, I was in accident.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   No, I know.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.040]   Carson, you should apologize to Andy.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   Now just shake his hand.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.240]   Why didn't he get a timeout?
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   That's fine.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.320]   Now, if you do want to go off and get coffee, I prepared a list of all the comments that
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.640]   I was going to make and many of them were really, really, really sweet and genuine.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.280]   I give the, I give you the talking stick.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.000]   The only thing that was the only big thing to talk about in the in the leak story was
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.720]   that I was talking to a couple of developers who were saying a it's it's they don't they
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.760]   don't just shake the extra sketch and start all over again when they go to iOS 10.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.040]   There are going to be parts of elements of code that they're going to reuse from time
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   to time.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.680]   They're also saying that part of one of them was also saying who who does a lot of forensics
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.720]   was saying that oftentimes looking at the Ross, not the disassembled source code, but actually
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.360]   from the source source code, it gives them a lot of insights into how these how this team
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.920]   thinks and what their priorities are and every piece of information you can get about a target
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.240]   is always going to be useful.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.280]   So if you're talking about it in the future, if you're if you're trying to get into somebody's
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.480]   phone for again, for forensics or because you work for the government and you have four
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.920]   different options of how the develop how the developers of this code do that.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.200]   It will probably narrow you down to one or two.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.920]   If you've seen their original source code from a previous project is, you know, that
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.280]   no, they probably wouldn't do it that way.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.520]   They would probably do it this way.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.040]   So it's that's it's I think it's more interesting from an educational point of view for people
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.360]   to see here is how here's what this code looks like and here's what here's how it gets put
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.760]   together, but it's not insignificant.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.880]   And if anything, it will mean that those love those Apple employees that you typically
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.360]   don't see the ones that have the black polo shirts are probably knocking on some doors
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.200]   figuratively and literally and some people are having a bad day.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.840]   By the by the way, Mack, I didn't realize I wish I'd seen this before I tried to pull
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.600]   out that cable Apple repair home power cables for 29 bucks, but remorse they should not
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.800]   be removed.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.280]   Oh, never mind.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.680]   The home pod includes built in power cable says Apple that should not be removed in
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.960]   the rare instance the cable is detached or damaged to not attempt to remove or plug it
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.400]   back into the home pod.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.160]   If the case, oh, which I just did, if the cables are removed or impaired damage could
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.120]   have occurred to the cable of the internal components of the home pod.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   Wow.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.600]   Which I wish I'd seen this before I tore it out.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.720]   So that's not that's not the typical unplug it to put into storage or to move it someplace
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   else.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.520]   That's the instead of ripping out the circuit board, it will detach and an easily repairable
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.200]   point sort of plug like it falls off the it hasn't gone.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.320]   It's gone back in a little bit at an angle.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.040]   I'm a little worried now that maybe I haven't heard it.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:38.840]   It is it's on, but sorry.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:56.680]   This is the I don't sometimes I wonder why it plays with a place.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.360]   You know, I'm actually impressed with how good it sounds on video and on stream.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   Right.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   It shouldn't.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   Right.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.240]   It's reading your room through the Skype connection and then it's modulating the audio
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.160]   for the first months in this collaboration.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.760]   I think it's what it is.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.840]   Is it doing is it doing something like what Samsung and VW does with knows there's a microphone
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.000]   president's being tested.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.840]   It goes into a special optimized for this microphone.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   Oh, no, right.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.160]   I would turn it turns off at auto land.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   I cracked myself up.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.240]   Let's talk about iOS 12.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.160]   It's coming in the fall.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   We've mentioned before that Apple has decided not to make it a big feature update and focus
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   more on rooting out bugs, but we are starting to see some some tips.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.160]   For instance, Animoji in in more places.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   Right.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.080]   Because of lining up for that Leo in FaceTime.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.440]   Everybody wants to Animoji in FaceTime.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.400]   We've had I had that.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.880]   I'm pretty sure I had that with one of my first Logitech cameras had some software that would
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.680]   make my face out that doggy.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.280]   It's just for when Harry McCracken calls.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.240]   Where's new is old again.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.960]   Deeper Siri integration into the iPhone search view.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.120]   Do not disturb improvements.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.760]   We'll give you more options to automatically reject phone calls or silence notifications
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:29.520]   redesigned version of it's this is much demanded stocks app and a multiplayer mode for augmented
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.600]   reality games.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.240]   This is Mark Gurman coming up with all of this stuff.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.320]   Definitely lowering the chest.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.840]   I'm wondering if they're going to do something if they're going to make Animoji as a service
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.680]   to use a buzzword.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.920]   After finding out how many people were just using it as just to do lip sync videos.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.960]   I know that something that's available to third party developers already, but to make
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.360]   it easier to essentially make that a mode of the FaceTime camera to make that a mode of
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.720]   the standard camera app.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.200]   I think that would be something that would be wonderfully silly, wonderfully stupid and
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.360]   a good project to put someone on if you don't trust them with the boot code source code.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.080]   Take this intern internally code named piece.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.000]   It will likely be called iOS 12.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Those are the resorts.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.360]   I don't know why it wouldn't be called iOS 12.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.520]   This could be some nice little surprises there.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:30.080]   Historically, Apple always has, they always have that list of things in the back of the
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.960]   drawer that they didn't get to the last time because there was something huge that they
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.200]   had to push that was going to be killing the entire project if they did not get facial
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.960]   recognition working.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   This is the time where they go to the back of the drawer, which is a term that I've heard
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.320]   once or twice before.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.760]   They say, "Well, remember how we thought that we could increase the performance of this
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.880]   if we just had a few weeks in which we could tear apart this code and rebuild it, but we've
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   never had that time."
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.320]   So, iOS 12 could be one of the more interesting releases in a long time.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.720]   And as often as the case, you've got to read with a fine-tooth comb when you got german
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.640]   because he's got lots of tidbits.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.440]   For instance, the animated emojis will also come to the iPad.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:17.080]   The company is working on a new model that will have the required face ID camera.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   Is that new news?
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.680]   I don't think I'd read that before.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.240]   Well, I mean, it's like touch ID came to...
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   We thought it would.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.640]   Yeah, but where do you put the notch in the iPad?
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:33.280]   Oh, you've got nothing but bezels there.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   Nothing but bezels.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.720]   The question is, can they source enough of those cameras to serve the iPad market?
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   It is much smaller than the iPhone market, but we'll figure it out.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.160]   Do you guys agree that iOS 11 is buggy?
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.560]   I hear people say this all the time.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.480]   It seems very stable to me of late.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.600]   It is better for me than iOS 7, iOS 8 and iOS 10.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.160]   No, iOS 9.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.760]   iOS 7 and 8, absolutely better than iOS 7 or 8.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.800]   I don't know if it's better than iOS 10.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.520]   The thing that's hard about this is every time this bug story comes up and it comes
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.280]   up every year, I go back and I look at my Twitter feed and I look at the iMore forums
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   and the Mac rumor forums and the Apple discussion groups.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.480]   And I try to get a sense of how upset we were with the previous year's bugs.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.120]   And with humans, you have this thing where past pain, we forget it really quickly because
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.200]   otherwise we would never do anything again.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.080]   But stuff that's bothering us now is the absolute most, like a fly around our head right now
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.880]   is the absolute worst thing in the world.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.600]   Doesn't matter if you broke your leg three years ago, that fly is just destroying your
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   life.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.680]   And we're like, because Twitter and social are such instant feedback now, I don't know
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.480]   if you saw it Leo, but there was this brilliant thread by Steven Sinofsky on Twitter yesterday.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   We were talking about that.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.640]   It was a, because he is one of the few people who was responsible for shipping software
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.920]   at scale.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   Many people aren't familiar with it.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   He did it off as much windows.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   Much.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   Windows 8.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   He also did SkyDrive.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.280]   He did Outlook.com.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.240]   So he has experienced shipping software and services at a massive scale.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.840]   And that tweet storm, bless him, it was super long.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   And Jason Snell pointed out only he could really write it.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.840]   And I'm glad he did, but he sort of laid out what it takes for a company to ship software
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.640]   at scale and going all the way back to incorporating next and then rolling out the iPhone and
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.040]   updating them every 12 to 18 months over and over again and adding new devices.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.480]   And he said, it's absolutely unprecedented in the history of modern technology.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.680]   And while we think there's a lot of bugs now, like he heard the same thing at Windows and
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.360]   every metric they said, you know, our crashes are down.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.080]   This is all down.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.200]   And he's sure that Apple has really good numbers on this stuff, but this is what happens when
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   you scale.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.360]   And he sort of defines the problem space of scaling a company really, really well.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.240]   And he was responding to the other part of Mark, Mark's news, which is that Apple is
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.800]   going to be emphasizing sort of these fixes.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   And they have this entire culture that has grown around radars.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.160]   You have someone files a bug.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.320]   It gets assigned a ranking from P1, P2, P3 to P4.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.760]   P1 is a showstopper that absolutely has to be fixed.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.160]   P2s are major bugs.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.520]   And maybe the P3s or P4s, nobody has time for it.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.200]   And everything gets assigned a radar and everyone is driven to fix those.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.400]   And if you hate, like, you're an artist, you're a craftsman, you want to fix this bug, but
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.280]   it's not assigned a high enough priority and you don't get to fix it.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.240]   And over the last few years, they've been changing that.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.600]   Famously, last year, Craig Federico said that they were allowing the teams and the individual
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   contributors.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.520]   That's what a single engineer is called at Apple to sort of have some time to fix the
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.760]   things that really bug them or work on the features that they really like.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.160]   And that's continuing to roll now.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.360]   So I think sort of what the survival mode they went into to ship iPhone, ship iPad and
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.800]   ship Apple Watch and get all this stuff out and get it all working together is sort of
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.600]   that cycle is ending or getting into a cycle now where we'll keep adding features, but
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.360]   either mature products and it really behooves us now to spend time smoothing them out as
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.240]   much as possible.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.720]   He actually compares the iPhone to iPhone iOS development cycle.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:45:00.360]   He said to the IBM system 360 said Apple's done kind of an amazing thing, which is release
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.040]   every 12 to 18 months for the entire.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.280]   He says 20 years, but I think, oh, I guess, is he talking about from next?
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.680]   Oh, for since next.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.520]   Okay.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.880]   Well, somewhere larger and smaller that there wasn't much comparable anywhere.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   And so I think nothing without some big gaps or some massive architectural bets playing
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.280]   out over years.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:28.680]   Apple was disrupting the PC market with a unique point of view, but no one knew.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.720]   He talks about the nuance between features, schedule and quality says you can't have all
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   three.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.280]   You try to have all of them, but in practice, you know, you're going to have to pick, you
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   know, one or two.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.400]   Yeah, be pragmatic.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   This is really good.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.640]   I just, I wish he hadn't put it on Twitter.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   It seems like.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   Number 16 is good too.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   Number 16.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.640]   Okay.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.560]   When you look at a feature like Face ID and trace it backward all the way to keychain,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.560]   see how much long term thought can go into a feature and how much good work and good
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:04.160]   go unnoticed or even fail for years before it was worth surfacing as a big advantage.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.120]   That's long term POV and focus.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.120]   We do know that about Apple.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.520]   Apple often releases stuff.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:15.000]   That, yeah, that just sits there and you go, well, you know, like passbook.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Remember passbook?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.040]   Apple pay cash now, but look at passbook like us is useless.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   Right.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.400]   For a long time, but they, but it's a piece to a larger puzzle.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Even quick time.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.880]   If you remember the first demos of it, the all they can show was, Hey, look, there's
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.880]   a picture.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.280]   There's a, there's a, there's a Microsoft Word document with a video of an Apollo rocket
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.680]   launching.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.080]   And even I didn't really get it at the, at the beginning, but when you until I was talking
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.680]   to engineers months later about what they were putting into it and what they were building
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   around it.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.800]   And even then it took me three or four years to figure out that no quick time is really
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.960]   going to be everything about delivering content on, on the Mac for the, if there is a Mac
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.320]   in the next two years, it will be, it's going to be the root of pretty much everything.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:04.440]   It's a pretty big deal that how big Apple rolled the dice on OS 10 back before it was
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.120]   even Mac OS 10.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.560]   And now it's still not just the root of every Mac out there, but it's also the root of every
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.600]   iPhone and every, of every, every iPad up there.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.800]   So this was something that really it's, it wasn't, it was a role of the dice.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   Yes.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.080]   But I can't think of another gamble that paid off better or bigger than that.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:29.720]   Sonovski says I could say in any absolute sense, Apple has exceeded anyone else, but
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.600]   he points out something and this is kind of germane to the recent conversation about snap
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.840]   chat.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.080]   People are rebelling against the new snapchat and he says the more product is used, the
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.240]   more hypersensitive people get to how it works.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.600]   The human brain is extraordinary and how it recognizes even the slightest changes in
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.120]   responsiveness, performance and sequencing of operations.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:56.280]   He says it comes from our primordial instinct for survival, the ability to spot a tiger
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   in the grass.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.360]   The same ability to detect small change drives us nuts on computers.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.600]   That's maybe why people are complaining about iOS 11.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.800]   I mentioned it in both my iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 review in that we, as humans, we hate change,
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   but we hate boredom.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.160]   It's really hard to balance those two things.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.200]   Well, but then again, there's a reason why the design of a hammer hasn't really, as a
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.040]   manual tool hasn't really changed.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.600]   We've made different kinds of hammers, but we haven't found the need to put an extra
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   kink in the handle.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.640]   We haven't found a need to change the order of, is it a, is it a prying device or is it
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   a blunt device?
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.400]   Because the thing is when people are reacting to technologies, not as a creative expression,
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.480]   but as a tool, they just want that tool to work the way that they expect it to.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.920]   We haven't, there's so many different ways we could steer a car, but we have a wheel.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.800]   And a configuration of pedals is familiar from model to model to model.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.320]   And it's not because people keep changing cars so often.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:57.920]   It's because if you, you, people are not willing to believe your numbers that this new triangular
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.120]   steering wheel is a much better solution.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.880]   They're wondering why they have to learn something brand new that to them doesn't give them extra
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:09.560]   features or make anything any simpler and just simply makes something that they were
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.760]   so familiar with that they could use it in their sleep almost literally that why do they
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.920]   have to learn new skills for it.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.880]   So that's, there's always going to be that balance there.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.760]   I think that there's in every good production team, there are, there's that person who has
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.320]   to kind of hold the team back saying, yes, that's a great concept, this triangle, we're
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.960]   definitely going to be putting in the next concept cars that at the Detroit Auto Show,
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.440]   but we are going to only put it into production vehicles after a lot of thinking and a lot
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   of testing.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.200]   But I feel like back in the old days when we fought with war hammers, there was a lot
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.920]   more innovation in the hammer space and now that it's become a tool, we sort of, we don't
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.400]   worry about the claws or the spikes or stuff so much.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.080]   And like the phones are still new and exciting and we're working them out.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   And then a hundred years from now, it'll be like, ah, here's your slab, here's your smart
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   user mother box, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   go.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   It won't be as much fun then, will it?
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.440]   No, it happens, but they will have something new.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   Well, our transporters are scattering our atoms across the galaxy.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   Can't we have one that just works, Leo?
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   And nobody's going to, nobody's going to catch up.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   There's always going to be that device that keeps getting improved, but at some point,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.400]   you can't, there's only, you can only go so fast with a car, you're going to have to,
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.840]   it doesn't matter how efficient that car is, you're not going to get an ocean, over an
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.240]   ocean with a car.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.320]   So that's, that's the other, that's the other edge of that quote.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.560]   At what point do you kill your own product or do you simply realize that's getting spun
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.160]   up on a new way of doing something is going to be so hard for us internally that we're
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.960]   just going to have to be the last company that makes really great cars?
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   Yes.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:47.400]   The Apple original content juggernaut continues to march.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   They've just signed.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.760]   Oh, I'm really happy to see this actually.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.520]   Kamal Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, the creators of The Big Sick.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.920]   And of course, you know, Kamal from Silicon Valley.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   They're, they're, and Smilf executive producer Lee Eisenberg and master of non co-creator
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:09.160]   Alan Yang to make a new series called Little America, a half hour anthology series based
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.440]   on true stories about immigrants in the US.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.920]   Another scripted series to his line.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.120]   They got a ton of stuff.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.480]   There was a great speaking of great insightful blog posts.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.920]   It was a really good one from the Rajam report.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.520]   I never read this before, but I, I, I, I linked it in the show notes.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.640]   I don't know if you earned the, I don't know if you guys got a chance to read it, but he's
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.800]   talking about Apple and the video market and he's, he's great.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.600]   Have you read his stuff before?
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   I've met.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.800]   Oh, we've had coffee at the outside Cupertino on the satellite.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.360]   He's really, really smart paying a lot more attention to him.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.520]   And he's just started a podcast called Rajam radio.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:54.440]   So he sets out in the beginning just to talk about what's going on, the two trends in the
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.680]   US video and TV market.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.480]   Traditional pay TV is in decline.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   And I had, when I see, when you see the numbers, it's kind of dramatic as more and more people
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:14.400]   are cutting the cord, Comcast and dish and direct TV dropped 872,000 subscribers in the
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.680]   in Q3 2017.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.840]   That's a 3.1% year over year decline.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:25.400]   You can't sustain a 3% decline for very long without going out of business.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:30.560]   And then of course in the same time, a subscription streaming services like network Netflix are
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.560]   huge.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:38.080]   But I didn't know is how big Hulu is Netflix has 8 million new streaming subscribers around
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.640]   the world.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.840]   So it's growing very fast.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.440]   Hulu has 17 million US subscribers.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.720]   That's a growth of 40% year over year.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.680]   Disney's about to start streaming.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.440]   So in that environment, now he talks about what Apple is up to.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:53:00.320]   And Apple has this real challenge because right up till the moment, it's all based on
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.520]   buying or renting stuff from iTunes, right?
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.680]   They're really not in there.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.720]   They're not in this market.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.000]   And that is also a bad market to be in.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.960]   Apple's market share for renting and selling movies has been falling for several years.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:22.840]   He's quoting Trip, Michael and Ben Fritz in the journal, tumbling to between 20 and 35%
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.080]   used to be as much as half.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.520]   So now it's one fifth to one third of the market.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.320]   And more and more people are streaming, obviously fewer people are renting and more and more
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.240]   people are streaming.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.520]   So with this in this environment, you kind of understand what Apple's seeing as a problem
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:46.000]   and why they're going to go to this original content model that's doing so well for Hulu
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   and Netflix.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.840]   He also talks about the TV app and quotes Neil I Patel from the Verge saying the TV app
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.920]   really is the beginning of an entirely new TV home experience.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.360]   And just added news by the way, the TV app, they have a sports tab, they've have Amazon
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.720]   Prime, the only major service.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.720]   The Olympics.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.920]   Yeah, the only thing is, yeah, I've been watching Olympics in it.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.280]   The only major service is missing is Netflix.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   The app is holding out.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.160]   They don't want to surrender control of the air face to Apple just yet.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   The Apple TV is struggling.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.920]   It's seeing year on year declines.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.000]   It's not doing well.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.880]   So that's an, in fact, if you look at it compared to its competition, it's really
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:36.400]   the weakest of the big four, the Chromecast Roku Amazon Fire TV, 21.3 million users in
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:41.160]   July 2017, according to estimates, of course Apple doesn't say.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:47.400]   Didn't mention Apple TV at all in their earnings release in this most recent quarter, did they?
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.120]   The only ever mentioned it when someone asked about it, otherwise it gets bundled under
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.920]   other, it's in categories.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.880]   And it's way, part of this is its price.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.440]   And this is one category where people are very, for some reason, I don't know why.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:05.000]   Things like video game consoles and set top boxes are very price sensitive.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   The Roku.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Message is vacillated.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.520]   Like they announced it's all about the apps.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   The future of TV is apps.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.000]   And then the next year it's all about HDR, which is not apps.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   That's TV content.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.600]   And you've got to go to pick one of those and double down on it.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.400]   And my wish list is still, I love the fact that you can get the Chromecast and you can
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.760]   get the Amazon Fire Stick.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.320]   And it would be great if you had embedded Apple TV software on your iPhone.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.920]   And then when you're in the hotel, you just throw the Apple TV Express into the back of
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   the HDMI port.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.440]   And it's not the same as having a dedicated box, but it helps build out that ecosystem
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:38.520]   way faster and are much more easily digestible point of entry for people who are used to
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.680]   really cheap set top box.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.920]   You quote John Gruber saying, what does Apple TV offer to justify costing over twice as
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.520]   much as the other guys?
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.120]   Silicon, but people don't care.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.280]   Well, but it's they're not delivering, that's all it can is in delivering features, at
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.120]   least not any, any features that actually relate to people.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.720]   And really it is, it really is going to be about apps.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.840]   If more and more and more as the time goes by, the FCC just approved a new plan for the
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:07.000]   next generation of digital television in which essentially every right now you right
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.080]   now you have a digital video stream that is behaving kind of like broadcast television,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   old fashioned broadcast television, where you tune into a channel, the new system is
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:25.520]   going to be more like wireless broadband where the they're broadcasting a sort of like a
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.920]   an IP signal where it's a real data to a data connection between the receiver, the
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:35.520]   person is watching and the transmitter so that this thing you can you'll be able to
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.280]   watch on a regular TV, but you can also watch on your phone just as easily without having
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.320]   a special tuner box or tuner chip built into it.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:50.200]   And part of that is that it drives advertisers to now be able to scrape data from people who
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.600]   are watching the tonight show just as easily as a cable company can or just as easily as
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.840]   Netflix can.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:02.400]   So it's if maybe part of Apple's game is realizing that the that the box is going to
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.760]   be irrelevant and that the more important game is to make sure you put development into
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:11.520]   the TV app so that no matter where that app lands, if it becomes if you integrate it,
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.160]   for instance, into Apple music so that you can run it on any platform or if they make
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.720]   it an app, God forbid, that can even run on Android TV or Roku, then that's still a
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.960]   win so long as you get people going there.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.280]   And the third problem is that with media consolidation, there are more and more there's
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:32.160]   more and more rumblings that this idea of Disney selling their movie licensing their
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.080]   movies to multiple platforms.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.800]   That's probably entering its sunset phase is going to be a locked in channel where if you
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.960]   want Disney, if you want Pixar, you've got to go to Disney's own streaming service.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.680]   If you want to get certain sports, you have to go to this locked in streaming service.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.760]   I think that's where we're going to be in three or four years.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.680]   And although I'm with Gruber, I'm with pretty much everybody else.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.920]   I'm struggling for reasons to recommend the Apple TV box to anybody.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.120]   It's possible that they're putting as much effort into it as it needs to get before it
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.960]   becomes an obsolete category, not just an obsolete product.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:14.040]   So Rajam's argument is that Apple, the future of TV for Apple is content, is TV.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.760]   Apple TV, the notion that the future is apps just didn't make sense.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.560]   He says the reality of the TV, TV's aren't computers.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.640]   There are only two use cases that have brought appeal video consumption, watching TV and
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.480]   console gaming.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.840]   And Apple's failed in the console gaming arena.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.280]   I think we can agree with that.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.000]   So it's really going to come down to.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.960]   And what it is is really a detailed analysis of what has ended up being Apple's, clearly
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.400]   Apple's strategy, which is to create exclusive content.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:52.920]   So that's a great, I think a really great analysis that maybe even the skinny bundle,
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   which Apple had talked about for years and never has been able to happen, the locals
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.120]   and some cable stuff on Apple TV.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.160]   He says it's for the best this didn't pan out, the decline of the traditional pay TV is not
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.880]   simply about cost.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.600]   It's the market rejecting the paradigm of linear television.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.200]   It's an on demand world.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.960]   I think I agree with him.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.840]   I mean, Microsoft for decades was trying to get the Xbox into the living room and they're
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   working on IPTV.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.680]   This is like, this is a Steve Jobs, that famous interview.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.080]   With Wall Street Journal with all Mossberg along time ago saying just if you think cell companies
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.920]   are tough to get into dealing with the individual lifetimes that are TV companies, it is a
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]   huge problem.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.880]   That's why I think this decoupling and these change of sources, who would have foreseen
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:38.240]   Netflix even when Steve Jobs had that conversation about Mossberg and Hulu and the advent of
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.520]   all of these channels.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.520]   And now where is Apple going to put all this television that there?
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.240]   We just talked about another new show.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.280]   Is that going to go in the Apple Music app or is to Andy's point, is that going to be
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   in the TV app?
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.800]   And is a TV app going to take on the life of its own where it's not just an agglomeration
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.080]   of existing services, but as its own services content, it as well.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:59.520]   The same way Apple TV, sorry, Apple Music has been displacing iTunes is whatever the TV
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.120]   app going to be displacing the iTunes movies and TV show stuff.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.200]   I mean, it's super interesting where this is all going.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.240]   Here are the challenges according to Rajam.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.640]   One content development and production of not things Apple's done before will these shows
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   even be good.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   We've seen a couple that aren't.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.400]   Even if the shows are good, will it be enough to support Apple TV's 100% pricing premium
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.560]   over its competitors?
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.840]   If growing services revenue is a high priority, and I think Apple has shown that it is, will
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.520]   then do they put this original content on non-Apple platforms?
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.880]   Which is what you were saying, Renee.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.440]   And how does differentiation between iOS and TVOS factor here?
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   In other words, with their Apple TV is kind of a big question.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.280]   Apple ultimately has to decide what is more important.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.400]   Apple TV is a premium hardware product line, Apple's traditional business, or a streaming
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.600]   video service that runs across all of its platforms.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   What atoms does Apple need in order to get its services onto your television?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   It's a fundamental question.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.680]   If that's where they want to be, but I think that's where the services are important, that's
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   where they need to be.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.360]   The great thing about creating original content is that you actually get profits both ways.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:22.640]   You get it as an exclusive towards your streaming channel, but also when it comes time to the
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   second run, when it becomes time for to put it in the iTunes Store as a purchasable $2.99
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.520]   per episode download, and also the Google Play Store and also the Amazon video store,
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   I would assume that Apple owns a percentage of the show, and they will get those revenues.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.200]   And then everyone who buys those shows are now more inclined to get hooked on it, and
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.840]   then want to sign up for Apple Music just because they don't want to wait for the year
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.880]   for the next season of one day at a time or Game of Thrones or whatever it is that they
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.120]   can't get for free on whatever service they're already subscribing to.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.400]   Bad news if you're one of those people who bought Verizon's iPhones because they were
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.920]   unlocked as of today, they're going to be locked.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.040]   Now I always thought that they had to sell them unlocked because of a consent decree with
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.760]   the FCC, so maybe that consent decree is run out.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.640]   Verizon says, "No, no, it's because we want to prevent criminals from stealing unlocked
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.320]   phones that could be resold or used overseas.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.920]   It's to combat theft and fraud," says Verizon.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.680]   You know, you're not needing that new trial, do you?
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.280]   They can sell it like a late Leo.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.040]   It's clear that Verizon wants the locky and the Verizon.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.640]   That's why they're doing it.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.520]   I was going to say something definitely must have expired because if they would not have
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.240]   used the, it's for the good of the consumer that we're doing this unless they were guilty
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   of something.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.520]   I don't even mean that as a joke.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.040]   That is such a textbook thing.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:53.600]   So, Verizon hasn't yet said how it will unlock, although it's presumed that like AT&T, they'll
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.200]   offer to unlock a smartphone after a certain period.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   Once your phones pay, obviously.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.720]   The locking only made sense in the days, I think, in the days when carrier locking was
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.320]   only because the carrier was subsidizing the phone.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]   And they-
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   They also for a while, I've said that they-
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   They've also for a while, I've said that people travel.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.880]   Well, and I think a lot of companies, if you say I'm going overseas, will do a temporary
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.040]   unlock.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.360]   But really, if you buy a phone outright, as more and more people do today, you really
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.680]   should be able to put it on any carrier you want to.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.040]   It's your damn phone.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   Locking is anti-coilutive.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.000]   I only ever buy it from Apple directly and I only ever buy it on the phones.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Well see, in the US, Apple doesn't always sell unlocked phones, right?
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   In Canada.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   They don't.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   I don't understand.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.160]   Yeah, almost every country in the world, day and day, you get the unlocked version of
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.840]   phones except in the US where then like a month or two later, like, yay, the phones
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.000]   are finally unlocked.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.320]   Well, the Verizon used to be the one we'd say, everybody get Verizon.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.720]   It's got the complete reset of radio, CDMA, GSM, and it's unlocked.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.120]   Yeah, and that's not true anymore.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120]   Well, if anything else-
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.280]   If anything else, this is such a different market than it was 10 years ago.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.200]   Now, not only is it very, very easy to switch carriers, but now carriers are actively fighting
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.320]   to get your business.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.160]   This is why, yes, the unlimited data is largely phony, baloney stuff, but at least they care
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.800]   enough about getting your business to at least give you a phony baloney version of unlimited
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   data.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   At least they care enough about me to lie.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:25.040]   No, I mean, at least there's the principle of you won't necessarily get charged an extra
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   10 bucks for one more gigabyte of data.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.960]   You'll just get like haze, dial up modem speeds, which for a lot of people at the end of the
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.320]   month is perfectly fine.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   But that's what I'm talking about.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:39.640]   It would have been the idea that AT&T at the time was so desperate to get a hit phone
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.680]   in their hands that they offered unlimited data to everybody who bought an iPhone at
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.920]   that first year.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.240]   That in itself will tell you how desperate these carriers are to get new subscribers,
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.000]   to get people to pay month after month.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.480]   They could practically give away these phones for free.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.400]   Actually, at a point point, they practically did.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.400]   If it meant that you get a new subscriber, paying them 60, 80, $100, $200 a month.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.720]   I'm surprised locking is still even allowed.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.880]   I know the FCC in the past has kind of said you have to offer an unlocking, but they've
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.200]   never really seemed to have forced it.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.880]   It's amazing when I show somebody, I have a second phone that is, that my international
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.520]   travel phone has two sims on it.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.440]   But when I explain to them that when they usually they have a little conversation about
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.760]   how do you test phones?
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.600]   I say, "Oh, I'll just pop the sim out of my user's daily driver popping into this."
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   You can do that.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.280]   What happens when you send the phone back?
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.880]   Then I take the sim out and it ceases to be, but what happens?
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.240]   No, you're still here.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.200]   I usually have a sim extractor in my wallet.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.960]   Look, the thing that identifies your phone as yours, if you put this in any phone you
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.120]   like that's unlocked, it will work.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.560]   People don't understand the technology.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   People don't understand the freedom they have.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.760]   It's one thing to have freedom, but freedom is useless without knowledge.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.320]   I just, what I really worry about is now that Apple's selling unlocked iPhones, you want
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.080]   to get one unlocked, obviously.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.680]   What I worry about is that you will then register it with a carrier and they will somehow lock
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   it.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.080]   They were doing that right for a while with that weird unified sim that was in the iPad.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.320]   AT&T would lock it that way.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:26.480]   Also, if you plug that into iTunes, it could be sim unlocked based on an EMEI.i.a. database.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480]   It was a vexing.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:33.520]   Yeah, well, we'll watch with interest as this story develops.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.480]   Florida man's in the news again.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.680]   This time, Florida man says his AirPods blew up while they were in his ears.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.880]   Jason Colon was working out his local gym when he noticed his right AirPod billowing
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.040]   smoke when he realized it was billowing out of his ear.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.240]   He took him out, sat him on the gym machine, went to seek help when he returned the right
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.640]   AirPod at burst open and showed flame damage.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   It was already like this.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   It was already popped.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.040]   They didn't see it happen, but I mean, it was already fried.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.360]   You can see flame damage, Colon said.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.400]   Fortunately, he removed them before he took it out of his ear.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.840]   Apple says we're investigating.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.840]   You think this is, I mean, that's a small battery in that AirPod, but I guess any lithium
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   ion battery.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840]   Any lithium ion battery.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.280]   Any time a lithium ion product ships, there will be a very small number of devices that
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.440]   suffer catastrophic failure.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.840]   Sometimes it's due to damage.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.880]   Sometimes it's damaged before it's going to rise.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.640]   Customer oftentimes, the moisture, they drop it, heat, something happens to it.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.280]   It's the same thing that with the, with the, we made the Galaxy Note 7 unusual that it
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.560]   had an incredibly high rate of catastrophic failure, an unacceptably high rate, but you
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.440]   will always find any popular device that shipped in the tens of millions or five million of
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   them.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.920]   You'll find a few that go off is when that number exceeds a few that you have to start
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   worrying.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.120]   So nothing to see here.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.200]   Well, probably not.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   I think if they were, if they were a catastrophic problem, I think that that's, that's the sort
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.880]   of thing that happens the first two months, it becomes absolutely clear.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.840]   This isn't just isolated incidents.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.560]   Although I will say that I did have to return my first pair after a couple of weeks because
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.520]   the, the, I don't know that it was a, it was battery swelling, but the case had started
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.560]   to come apart a little bit on one of the earbuds.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.960]   And I don't think there are many things that could have done that outside of a battery
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.460]   swelling.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:35.680]   But again, the numbers don't lie if it's, if it's, if it's news that one of these air,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:41.680]   air pods exploded or caught on fire, then that doesn't, that just means, okay, law of
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   average is catching up to you.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.400]   If it's, if the news story is another pair of air pods caught fire and exploded, then
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   you have a problem.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.440]   So we'll watch with interest.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.880]   And that would have, that would have been distressing.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.480]   I will, let's not acknowledge that.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.880]   I think use insert in your ear catching fire and popping.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   That is distressing.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.680]   And I think we should, I hope, I hope they give them a replacement pair, even if it's
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.680]   out of warranty.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:12.040]   I think we should probably say, if your air pods feel warm in your ear or you do smell
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.400]   smoke, you might want to remove them as quickly as possible.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.160]   If smoke is shooting out of your ear, that might, it might not be because you've, you've
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.920]   hit your maximum zone from the treadmill.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.200]   It's possible that it's, I can't, something that needs to be a threat room and saying,
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.800]   why did he go seek help?
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.320]   Was, is the, is the gym manager a trained bomb disposal expert?
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   What was he?
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.760]   My, my, my air pods are burning up.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.960]   Do you care about the, uh, our one more time?
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.520]   Let's just for old time's sake.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:46.440]   A lot of people right now, I think are leaving Apple's, uh, Steve Jobs Theater, because today
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.680]   was the day, right?
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.120]   For the shareholders meeting scooter X, our chat mod is there.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.760]   I also met somebody else who went.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.960]   So we'll, we'll ask anybody who went to give us a report, uh, what, what the theater looked
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.880]   like and how the apple park, it's, this is the last, I've got to be one of the last drone
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.120]   flyovers, the February drone flyover.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.760]   Before the missile batteries are, are, are you an autonomous?
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.720]   It's pretty much done, although some landscaping still going in and cause it's winter in California,
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.600]   some of the trees a little bear and I'm sure over time this will get more lush and, and
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   beautiful.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.760]   There's the Steve Jobs theater in all its glory.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   I'm really jealous of the show.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   It's hard to go there.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   How big is it?
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   It's a Renee.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   How many people can sit in there?
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   Oh, a few thousand.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   I mean, it can be that big.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   Oh, it can be that big.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   Well, yeah.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.080]   So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like the, the cube Apple store.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.360]   I mean, you thought the cube was the Apple store, then you go in and you go down the
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.640]   stairs and know that's the Apple store.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   Right.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.320]   That bar on the top is just like a reception area and you walk in and then there's these
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.920]   huge stairs and saw the blueprints a while ago, but there's a massive structure underneath
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.800]   there, including pod bay doors that close.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.680]   So it could be bigger for the shareholder meeting that would be for say the iPhone launch.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.680]   I think it's the same.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.080]   Like, I don't, I don't know if they look like a, like there's not a stadium as far as
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.280]   they don't just go all the way around.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   Right.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.080]   It's front facing and they have those beautiful leather seats and all of that.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.800]   I think it's probably the same capacity, but town hall was like a hundred fifty, two hundred
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.040]   fifty people.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.120]   This is in the thousands.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.560]   There are a lot of shareholders.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.900]   Not everybody could get in.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   There was a lottery.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.600]   And one of the shareholders asked for a tour and Steve Tim Cook set up, you know, you know,
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.840]   can't show you what's inside.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840]   That's sad.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   It's beautiful.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.200]   You're getting as close as anybody from the outside's going to get.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.320]   Well, they have visit center set up.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   Now that's open to anybody.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   You can go there.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.200]   Very, very small cafe max.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.400]   It just does coffees and teas and power bars and some like matcha, chocolate and stuff like
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   that.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.000]   And then there's the apple park apple store, which has a traditional apple store stuff
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.920]   plus the top bags and some t-shirts.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.840]   Was your briefing at the apple park?
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.880]   I think it normally would be, but this was so specific to HomePod that they did it at
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   the sound lab.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   Then they did it.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.600]   They Apple has got the Apple sort of puts together these little for home kit briefings.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.120]   They put together these little houses or not houses.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.640]   They're sort of like, I can't tell because I don't know real estate, but you go into
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.280]   a building and Apple has like a condo or something in the building and they have everything
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   set up in there.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.400]   Like in a kitchen, here's the HomePod in the living room.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   Here's the HomePod.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.320]   And then you can, they're not just sitting across from a table talking to you, but they're
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.320]   giving you demos and showing how it works and discussing how you could use it in different
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   places.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.280]   Well, it's a beautiful campus.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.520]   And if you get to see it, you're getting a special treat and I'd love to hear from any
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.440]   shareholders who went this morning to see it.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.600]   We'll hear from Scooter X.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.200]   I'm sure when he gets back.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   Let's take a break.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.120]   When we come back, you're picks of the week in the mood.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   Yes, sir.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120]   Do some homework.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.120]   Indeed.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.360]   Figure out something to talk about besides the HomePod.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.400]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.000]   If you're getting a new home, you know, very few people can actually bring a briefcase
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.160]   full of cash and buy a new home.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.360]   Most of us have to get a loan.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.760]   And of course, the first thing you say is, well, I'll go to the bank, right?
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.800]   That's where loans come from.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800]   Maybe not.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.040]   Maybe the bank isn't the best place to get the loan.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.640]   Certainly, it's not the best home loan experience.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.800]   Now, for that, you've got to go to Quick and Loans.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.120]   Number one in customer satisfaction, according to JD Power, eight years running, including
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.360]   this most recent year.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.880]   And rightly so.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.840]   I mean, these guys really know what they're doing.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.680]   The number, a big lender, $92 billion in loans, they do a great job.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.000]   And now they've got this Rocket Mortgage that is perfectly designed for people like us who
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.160]   don't frankly want to go to a bank, don't want to talk to a lender, just want to get
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.480]   the loan out of the way.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.040]   We don't want to go up into our attic to get paperwork.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040]   Facts.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.920]   I don't even, facts, facts it over.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   You kidding me?
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.000]   No, with Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans, you can do the whole thing on your phone in
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.160]   just a matter of minutes.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.200]   You know, you owe it to yourself to go there and check and see what kind of rate you can
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200]   get.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.040]   And then you'll answer a few simple questions.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.440]   Do it online so you can do it on your phone, the tablet, the PC.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.120]   Stuff you already know in your head, you don't have to go get any paperwork.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.120]   They'll do all that for you.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.160]   Their trusted partners allow you to share your financial information with Rocket Mortgage
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.000]   at the touch of a button.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.920]   And then based on your income assets and credit, Rocket Mortgage can analyze all the options
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.560]   for which you qualify and find the one that's right for you.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.080]   You pick the down payment, you pick the term, the length of the loan.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.520]   You pick the rate.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.920]   This is great for refies too.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.320]   There is no better way to apply for a loan than Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.760]   You apply simply, you'll understand fully and you will mortgage confidently.

[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.840]   That was a good time to refie.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.520]   Rates are going up.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.080]   If you're looking at a house, there's no better way to do this than Rocket Mortgage.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.520]   Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520]   It's rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.640]   We thank them so much for making Mac Break Weekly possible.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.680]   Andy and I co, let's get a pick from you, Andy.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.600]   Let's talk about options for spending $300 to $400 on a smart speaker in case it's good
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.000]   time to think about the larger thing.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.880]   One such option is my pick of the week, it's the blue satellite headphones.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880]   Oh, I have those.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880]   I love those.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.880]   It's now they're not cheap.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.480]   They're $400 and I only really started seriously looking at them after thinking, "Okay, well,
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.720]   let's just say that I wanted to have a superior audio experience.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   I've got a budget between $300 or $400."
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.280]   So these are the first really, really, really, really good headphones that I've tried.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.880]   And boy, do they deliver.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.840]   These are the first, I re-listened to a whole bunch of old audio that I'm very familiar
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.160]   with and I was hearing details that I'd never heard before on my home stereo or any of the
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.000]   other speakers or things of things I've tried.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.880]   I'm not an audio file, so obviously this is a brand new experience for me.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:09.160]   And so maybe it's not, maybe your needs for audio are not necessarily have one speaker
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.680]   or a set of speakers in the house.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:16.720]   Maybe it is having that listening experience wherever you are in the world.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.720]   They are noise can't.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:23.640]   They have their, one of the, I'm not qualified to talk about the technical aspects of this
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.560]   except for, again, I was in really, really good recordings particularly.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.520]   I was hearing so much more details, so many layers.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:35.440]   You can actually, the difference between really good audio and great audio, I think, is can
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.240]   I actually feel what the room was like when it was being recorded as opposed to faithfully
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.640]   hearing the notes and hearing the performance?
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.920]   And that's what this is delivering.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.880]   This is why I think it's something you should definitely look at if you're thinking about
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.440]   putting three or $400 into a consumer device that gives you better audio.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.160]   It has its own, one of the things that says that it has its own built in headphone amplifier.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.840]   Oftentimes you see people who really, really like music, having a separate headphone amplifier
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.600]   plugged into whatever they're doing.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.800]   Okay, all I'm saying is that it really does sound really, really good.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.920]   They're also noise canceling, they're not as, I was comparing them also directly to the
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.320]   Bose noise canceling headphones across about 250 bucks.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.080]   I would say that the sound on these blues is way, way better.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.440]   Although the noise cancellation on the Bose is better, but not way, way better.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.960]   This is, this will, on a commuter train, this will knock down ambient noise so that you don't
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.000]   really notice it with the Bose.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.920]   I can have somebody talking on the phone three seats away and not even be aware that they're
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.000]   even talking.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.160]   But, so if that's the big deal for you then, okay, these are Bluetooth headphones so that
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.440]   you, you can plug them into analog audio.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.680]   You can run them off of Bluetooth for about a day if you're just using it as Bluetooth,
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.480]   about eight hours if you're using them on, if you're using the built in headphone app.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.920]   So it's something to think about.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.680]   It's once you start thinking that the music that you're listening to is worth a better
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:09.120]   listening experience, one of those solutions might be something as cool and modern as the
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   HomePod.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.080]   It might be something as out of left field as having lots of cheaper speakers throughout
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:18.040]   the house so that your room is being filled.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.440]   And maybe it will be actually finally for the first time in 15 years having an actual
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.200]   stereo system in your house with decent separate speakers.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.000]   All these things are possible in a budget like that.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.680]   And having a set of headphones, not something I would have immediately thought of, but now
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.200]   I think it was silly not to think of this originally.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.040]   400 bucks, definitely not cheap.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.680]   But again, if you have the ability to test these out, you might be surprised at how it
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.400]   will change your thinking about where your money should be going.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.800]   Yeah, I have to say, we don't mention headphones enough.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.320]   And good headphones will sound.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.440]   Everybody's good as a great stereo system and are less finicky as to placement and the
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.520]   kind of room you have.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.120]   And it's a great way to get work done.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.920]   And listen, I have a very nice pair of high-five man headphones.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.920]   And there is nothing better.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.400]   I mean, it really immerses you in the sound.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.880]   Plus, remember, when you have headphones, you can crank these up as loud as you want at
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.280]   one or two in the morning.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.800]   Okay, maybe don't for health reasons, but I've done it.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800]   But there's nothing there.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.200]   Now that I move from a separate house where nobody cares, there's at least a 10 to 20
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:31.320]   yard air gap between my speakers and the next living person in America to a beautiful
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.320]   old building.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320]   But there are neighbors.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:39.400]   It's like maybe it's 2 a.m., maybe not the time to play the Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.600]   this loud.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.760]   That's another factor to consider.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.880]   This will allow you to not even care what other people are doing at this time of day
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.480]   when you're enjoying your music.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   Mr. Renee Richie.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.320]   You're a pick of the way.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.640]   All right, so my favorite thing about the MacBray Weekly audience is that they're really
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.800]   forgiving when people like me are super late to realizing how good a product is and get
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800]   around to picking it.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.880]   So even if it's like a year or two after the product, everyone else knew it was a great
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.800]   product, I can still make it a pick without being too judgy judged on the interwebspot.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   That's the case here.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.360]   I appreciate that, Leo.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.800]   But I'm so all into home kit now and I keep picking home kit stuff because it works great.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.400]   And now that I have my ambient little Siri friend back there, I can just ask for all
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.920]   this different stuff and it just automatically happens.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.240]   So I'm going to steal Andy's Crane Cam 3000 bit for a second.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.480]   I'm going to move this over so that we can see the wall over here.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.920]   Hey, Siri, turn while you got them.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   Yay.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.920]   You don't have.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.480]   So you can hear it.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.280]   So there we can.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.280]   You can sort of see it.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   So I have a few right now.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.400]   I'm going to add a few more, but it's really cool.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.640]   You can set them to be lights, to be any color.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.120]   There's patterns you can do.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.360]   And I know everyone knows this already on the last person to do this, but you can make
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.200]   them look like a fireplace or running water or forests.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.320]   And it just it really lets you make cool.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.160]   I'm using it because it's a cool set and I'm using it when I do videos so I can do
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.200]   like different logos and things on the wall.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.760]   But it's really useful for a variety of situations.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.040]   I have no lighting in that corner and I could have put a traditional, like I have lights
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.040]   behind me.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.360]   I could have done those sort of lights there, but this is really different.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.880]   It's really exciting and they've got a little music attachment so that when I play music,
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.200]   it'll dance along with whatever music I'm playing.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.880]   So now that HomePod's in the area and I'll say, you know, whatever, play EPMD, it'll
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.280]   start rocking out with the music.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.600]   And it's just it's so much fun.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.240]   I think I want to make the Legend of Zelda the symbol next, but we'll see.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.520]   And there's bendy ones.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.320]   You can put them up walls and onto the ceiling.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.720]   And there's a new one that's a square that aren't out yet, but are even smaller and you
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.760]   could actually tile your wall in them.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   But it's just so creative and so much fun and I'm really enjoying sort of the fun that
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.160]   you can have with them.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.600]   How much was that set up that you've got there?
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.160]   So I bought in phases of stupidity.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   I bought like a one that was full retail just to get started and that had nine panels.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.480]   That was a starter kit.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:12.560]   And then Best Buy had a sale over the holidays that was down from 300 to $200 for 15 panels
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.360]   and the music kit.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.440]   And you can buy three panels for like, and this is all Canadian prices.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.760]   It's probably like half this US, but you can buy like three panels for 40 or 50 bucks
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.320]   and then nine panels in the starter kit for like a hundred, 150 bucks.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:29.280]   And then that's 15 pound ones, I think was like $250.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.160]   So you can really get as many as you want.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.800]   And you think that nine is a lot, but after you start playing with them, you start scrounging
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.800]   your pennies thing.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:39.240]   If I just had one more row, I completely did that with you.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.840]   I'll go with my wall and keep ordering more hue lights.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   It's like I can't stop.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.880]   Those are a few lights behind me, Leo.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.240]   Yeah, I love you too.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240]   I got it.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.840]   I love stuff like this where and it's true the home pods true true of other speakers too,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:23:00.280]   where if you love it, you can keep putting money into it and make it even better.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.040]   And so yeah, it's like I've been so tempted by these panels, especially now them in a
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.040]   new place.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.280]   And I'm thinking that I don't know.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.640]   I don't have any art that fits that corner.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.880]   It's an awkward corner.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:17.720]   And I'm thinking I should buy at least 12 nano leafs in a line and just have that be
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.200]   like my Babylon five reception area.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:31.800]   I probably shouldn't mention this, but if anybody wanted to buy me a gift because there's
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.800]   no way I'm buying it.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.200]   Well, you made me think of this Andy because we're talking about headphones and I have
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.360]   a very nice pair.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:43.840]   I think they were eight or $900 of high-five man electrostatic planar headphones and it
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.440]   sounded really fabulous.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   But then I was looking at the high-five man site and boy, I really, this is the, they
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.720]   call it the Shangri-La.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.120]   It is electrostatic headphones with a tube headphone amp.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:02.720]   Now I should point out that high-five man is very high-end and they already sell a headphone
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.240]   amp headphone set for $18,000.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:13.600]   I'm thinking this one, it's going to cost upwards of $20,000.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.520]   But you know, you like the home pod?
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.200]   This might even sound better.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.640]   This might, this might even, even sound better.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:29.560]   They claim that it goes all the way up to 120 kilohertz, 7 hertz to 120 kilohertz.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:36.080]   And I just like the fact that it's got a tube amp because, you know, the fact that somebody's
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:42.640]   selling this brand new as a product is for headphones, it's not just a tube amp, it looks
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.640]   like there's at least eight tubes in there.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.360]   Talk about a fire hazard on the treadmill, that's it right there.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.480]   Do not wear this in the gym, my friends.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:55.040]   But it might give a new meaning to feel the burn, right?
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.280]   Yeah, they're so suzvara and EF 1000 is a $18,000.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.920]   So I can only imagine what they're going to charge for that new one.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.720]   You can literally, someone told me that a while ago that if you have millions of dollars,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.240]   you can spend millions of dollars in audio.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.840]   They will take as much money as you have.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.120]   They'll take it all.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.960]   They will take it all.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.440]   Every penny you've got the Shangri-La High-Fi Man.com.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.640]   Fortunately, my ears are not good enough to distinguish between that and, you know, a
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.800]   $50 parrot earbuds.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.280]   So I'm happy.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.280]   Oh God.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.800]   Wouldn't that bring people right down to earth if every high-end stereo store had like an
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.120]   audiologist saying, okay, guess what?
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.120]   No point.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120]   You are not.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.000]   Here's a vintage radio shack pair of speakers that would that in itself exceeds your ability
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   to listen to music.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   $18 used to be my lance.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   Go ahead.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.400]   It would only be fair.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   You may have millions, but your ears, they're worth a nickel.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.280]   Andy and I goes to the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.880]   You can read his blog, cwob.com and follow him on the Twitter at ihn, a TKO.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.360]   We love having you on every Tuesday.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.480]   You also have a bunch of other podcasts, including an Android podcast called Material.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.520]   Stuff that's about Google, not just the Android.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   So it's okay.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.120]   It's also about how Google ruins your life.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.200]   If you're an Apple user, not just a user of other things.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.440]   Listen and let Google ruin your life at replay.fm.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440]   Thank you.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.440]   Cool, but evil.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.840]   Yeah, we really appreciate it.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.600]   Also Renee Ritchie, who does such a great job, read his unreview of the HomePod for every
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]   detail.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.600]   That's how I find out how I use this stuff at imore.com.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:43.480]   His vector podcast is also a must listen at imore.com/vector.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.040]   Who are you talking to these days?
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.040]   Anybody interesting?
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.600]   So today, Georgia Dow, a mutual friend of mine, and myself, she's on to talk about parental
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.560]   controls and the dangers of green addiction.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.560]   She blew my mind.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.040]   She's a therapist and an educator and a mother.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.760]   And then in two days, we have Clayton Morrison talking about when I've had only with his new
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   business.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.880]   He's left Fox and he's high on life.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.840]   Clayton had a tie on the other day and he said, "I haven't put one of these on a long
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840]   time."
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.840]   I know.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840]   He's so great.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.840]   He's just so enthusiastic about technology.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.560]   We do Mac Break Weekly right after iOS today.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.320]   Usually we're a little late today, but we made up the time.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320]   Usually around 11 a.m.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320]   Pacific 2 p.m.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   Eastern Time, 1900 UTC.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.480]   If you'd like to watch live, go to twit.tv/live.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.520]   If you're live watching the stream, you might as well go in the chat room where there are
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.240]   live people talking about what's going on, IRC.twit.tv.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.920]   You can also join us live in studio as the three guys from New York who just walked into
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.840]   Todd, Patrick and Dave.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.440]   Just email, there they are.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.440]   Email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.520]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.600]   I think you're really here for security now, aren't you?
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   No.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.840]   Well, you're late for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.760]   We're just wrapping it up now.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.720]   Sorry, guys.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.200]   If you can't be here live or watch the live stream, you can always go on demand.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.400]   As we learn, that's what people really want.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   They want on demand.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.320]   We've got audio and video at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.040]   You can also find your favorite pod catcher and subscribe there.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.040]   That way you'll get every episode.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.840]   The minutes it's available, pocket cast, overcast, Apple's podcast app.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:27.680]   Or I'm happy to say you can just say, "Hey Siri, listen to Mac Break Weekly and your
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.080]   home pod will gladly play."
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.320]   Same podcast, Mac Break Weekly, MP3.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.720]   Just for you, the latest Echo game.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.240]   It's not Mac Break Weekly, Andy and Uncle Steve.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240]   That's very confusing.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.240]   We got a great, great show for you.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.240]   Renee.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240]   This is Antonio.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.600]   It's Mac Break Inception.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.360]   The best thing ever happened to podcast are these voice controlled speakers.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.200]   I mean, it's just fabulous.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   It's so easy.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.160]   You could just say, "Hey, listen to vector or listen to material."
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.280]   Sometimes you have to add podcasts, depending on the device, you might have to add additional
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.240]   clauses on the Amazon Echo.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.440]   Sometimes you have to say on tune in, that kind of thing.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.400]   We are also on the flash briefing.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.480]   If you have an Amazon Echo, there's a Twitch entry for the flash briefing.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   Please do add us now, not just in the US, but also Canada.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.400]   Australian, India.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.160]   And I think in one other country, I'm forgetting.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.920]   You can listen, just go to the Echo app and add us to your flash briefing.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.200]   We do little segments of this show and all of our shows each day, something new and fresh.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.200]   We still doing the survey.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.200]   We wrap that up yet.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.520]   I think there's one or two days left to do the survey.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.720]   We would appreciate it if you go to twitter.tv/survey and take it.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.920]   It's short just a few minutes.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:40.080]   Once a year, we ask our audience to tell us a little bit about themselves to help us
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.840]   do better programming for you and help our advertisers understand why it's a great thing
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:45.840]   to advertise on Twitter.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.480]   I promise no personal information will be shared with anybody, even me.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.720]   So it's really, we take it in aggregate.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.720]   I appreciate it.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.320]   Those of you who have already done it, thank you.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.400]   It really helps us.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.880]   Once a year, that's all twit.tv/survey.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:05.120]   Thanks for watching, but now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because...
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.880]   great time is over.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.160]   (upbeat rock music)
