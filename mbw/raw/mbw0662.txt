[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   is that the whole escape key model
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   got it. Okay. Yeah.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So the touch model is that one.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   (laughter)
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So John, I should probably
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   order this through the business.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   We actually have an Apple store
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   that we can use
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   and I think we get 10 percent.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Is it 10 percent?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   It depends on the product I think.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   No, it's not. It's nothing.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So I can order it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's a couple of percent. All right.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's $1.00. It starts that up.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   (laughter)
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Just a question with all these
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   amylos you get on your credit card.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You're prepared for travel in your life.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I haven't pushed the buy button.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   That's an awful lot of money.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I have the I9 to your old I9
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   which I gave my son because he's doing video editing
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   now. He wants to be a YouTube star.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   So I gave him that in the EGPU.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   He didn't take the EGPU.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He said, I don't want that.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   He left it here.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   He needs it here.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   He needs it here.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Oh, okay. So he needs it.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He is it here, I guess.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   All right. Well, I'm just going to hover my finger
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   over that buy button for the rest of the show.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   (laughter)
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   So they didn't.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So this throws out any rumor
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   that they might have fixed the keyboard
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   for WWDs.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   There is. I'm not the only one hearing it
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   but a lot of people are hearing that there is a fixed keyboard
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and a 16-inch
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   war on bezel machine in the future.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I'd be furious if I bought this in the EVDC.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Like at the end of the year, I'm not going to be
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   pissed off if I buy this because that's what I would want.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Well, but some people don't want Reve.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Like they're like, I'm not buying the first version
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   of a new Mac book. I never do that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   You know, for them they'll get the last version
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   because they figure that's the best of the of the previous
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and then they'll wait until the second or third generation
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   of the new one.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Like you buy the S here and you buy the new year.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I bought the Model X when it was one year old
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   one month old. I'm not. I'm Kuku.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   That way.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   You would consider this not a redesign.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   This is a slipstream of three.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's not a redesign. Yeah.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   They don't even call it a fourth generation butterfly.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   It's still the third generation butterfly keyboard.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   It just has a new material for the mechanism.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Emoryc is reminding us in the chat room
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   that if you bought a PowerBook 3400C in 1997,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   it would have cost you $6,500
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and that was when a dollar meant something.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Some of those Macs have been...
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I remember when I was a kid, it was like 10 grand.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   You know, real, my parents money back.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   The PowerBook Duo,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   which really should have been called a Duo over,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   was $37.50 in 1994 base model.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   So you know what?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It's not unusual when these things come out
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   that they're more expensive.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   The only thing to remember is that Apple only uses
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   what they consider to be the absolute best part.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So you can get, if you do part for part,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Apple's prices are usually the same,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   sometimes slightly better because they buy
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   so many of one thing that they get a little bit of price relief.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   But if you buy exactly the same components,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   the Apple pricing is almost always the same.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The difference is from other companies,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   you can buy lesser versions of almost every component
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and getting much cheaper overall computer.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But with Apple, you're getting the absolute fastest
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   MVNE drive available and that's it.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   There's no stepping down.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   You're getting the fastest RAM.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   You're getting all of these things
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   and that adds up to these prices.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I did just buy a power.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   I think Pat probably shouldn't buy it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That does sound a little foolish.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   My recommendation.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Yes, Lori Gill.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I do whatever Lori Gill says.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I bought this because of Lori Gill.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   This is that great hyper drive thing.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I bought my infinity pillow for Lori Gill.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   So what do you say Lori Gill? Whatever you say,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I will do.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I say hold off until after WWDC.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   If it turns out that Apple doesn't have anything big
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   to announce at that point,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   you can buy what they just announced today
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   and then you're good to go.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   But why would they announce this two weeks
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   before anything else at WWDC?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Sure, but they've got a new processor
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   in this MacBook Pro right now.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Maybe the upgrade that we're talking about
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   is going to be with a MacBook or a MacBook Air.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Maybe it's not going to be with a MacBook Pro.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   No, I see.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I definitely think that because of Apple's history
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and I know that they changed things around a lot.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But if we're going to see something at WWDC,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   we're going to see something at WWDC.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I've got to listen to Lori.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I say wait until after that.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It's only two weeks away.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You can hold off.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   All right, Renee, what do you say?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I'm going to double on my right shoulder.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   The angel on my left.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   My guess is that they announced this way today
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   to clear the deck for WWDC.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So there'd be no questions about a new MacBook Pro.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And they wouldn't have to go up there
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and talk about a butterfly keyboard at all.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And if they do have something else ready,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   like if they want to show off the new Mac Pro,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   for example, like they've done with the iMac Pro
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   and the previous Mac Pro,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   that gets the focus entirely on that and not at all.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So you're both in agreement.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I think you're right.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   If it's time to say something about the Mac Pro,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   which certainly won't be available today,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   but if they say something about the Mac Pro,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   they don't want to have to mention anything else.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   They've cleared the deck.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You said that's exactly right.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   It means we won't see a new MacBook Pro come June 3rd,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   but we might see something else.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   That makes sense.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Agreed, Andy?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Absolutely agreed.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   This is definitely the sort of,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   the timing of this also is this,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   they know that the people who are interested in this,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   this style of computer, this size of computer,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   this powerful computer,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   are the people who are probably going to build it to clients.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They are buying tools that they need right now
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   and waiting until the fall is probably not an option.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   So Apple is pretty much telling all these people,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   those of you who need the best CPU
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and a less fail like keyboard,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   we have something for you immediately.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Those of you who can maybe wait,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   you can wait, but that's going to take us several months.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I'd be surprised if at WWDC,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   they even pre-announce a new laptop
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   that has a major form rebuild.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Although I think Lori and Henry,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   and Renee will check me on this.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I think that we're roughly at the age of body style and types
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   where we're about ready to see Apple create a new chassis
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and basically a new hardware platform designed for the laptops.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I think we normally see throughout the old design,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   old tool, create a new design,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   a new tooling about every three or four years, don't we?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I think so, yeah.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   All right.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And of course, the arm would be--
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I would be--
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Well, that actually is a really good point.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   They're not going to do arm this year,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   but they are, in fact, we just saw a report,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   remember that Apple settled with Qualcomm
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and said we're going to be buying Qualcomm chips for a while.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   We just saw Intel say we're not going to do 5G modems.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Apple has also kind of implied we aren't going to have
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   our own radios for the iPhone for five years,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I think is the number that I heard.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   So we're going to continue to buy Qualcomm modems.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That, to me, now I know that's not really connected
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   with the idea of an ARM-based CPU from Echo S,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   but to me it's related.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   It shows you the timeframes for these developments.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And so I have a feeling, what do you think,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Renee, three years off from an ARM, two years?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Do you think it'll be next year?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   So the thing that we're always reminded of is silicon is hard.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   It's a completely separate topic, but we just saw Google
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   lost the two silicon engineers they stole from Apple
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and their other silicon engineer, and it sounds like
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   that whole division has melted down.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The Pixel core is gone, and they're going to be very good
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   for friends with Qualcomm CPUs for the foreseeable future,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   because it is so hard, so unforgiving,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   and so expensive to make your own silicon
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   that very few companies are crazy enough to do it.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   But Apple is literally the company that says we'd rather
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   have that block on the left, and we'd also say,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   but why? Because we'd really rather have it on the left,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   and we have $200 billion in the bank.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So my guess is that Apple, again, there's no ninth-generation
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Intel chip in the 13-inch, because Intel wasn't ready.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And it's far from the first time that Apple's had delays
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   because of those chips, and that probably is aggravating
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   them to no end.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   So I wouldn't be surprised if we keep seeing little things
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   in WWDC this year.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I'd be surprised if we got a 12-inch MacBook running arm,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   like a WWDC, but I wouldn't be surprised if we got it
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   over the course of the next couple of years, and we keep
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   seeing those little hints piling up that we're getting it sooner
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and sooner.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Interesting.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Also, Apple's-- I think the way that Apple definitely
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   wants to run their own silicon on Mac OS for at least the low-end
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   consumer-grade stuff.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   But I think that they really want to make it part of a very
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   deliberate and very strategic next step for Mac OS.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   So it's not just that they're going to be doing--
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I think they could have practically shipped an A10
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   processor-backed Mac a couple of years ago.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   But I think that what they really want to do is create the
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   sort of equity in the App Store with the transition with the
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Mars-a-Pan and the ability to sort of blur the lines of software
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   development between iOS and Mac OS.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   That sort of stuff will allow Apple to optimize the holy hell
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   out of Mac OS apps where applicable.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So it's not just that-- it's not going to be like, for
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   instance, the first MacBook Air where they built it.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   They built the hardware they're able to build without the software
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   support and as a result, they created a machine that would
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   fan up and slow down so much that it was almost like doing
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   work on a 1988 spreadsheet.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   It was so slow.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   When they released these new R-Mac books, it's going to be
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   the version of Photoshop that you're using on your desktop.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Of course, it runs more slowly because it's not a $5,000 laptop,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   but it works appreciably well.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   iMovie, you'll be able to edit in 4K just like you can edit
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   in 4K on an iPad because the hardware and the software and the
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   OS have been all optimized that way.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   So I think it's inevitable.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I think it's going to be something quite amazing when they do
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   release it.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I would guess within two years because I do think they want to
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   have at least a year and a half worth of Mars-Up and experience
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   for developers before they pull the trigger, but that's just a
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   guess.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   That sounds about right.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   In other words, it's not imminent.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I think it feels so inevitable, but not imminent.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Inevitable, but not imminent.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   But Seth, like when Steve Jobs took the stage and said,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   "It's been living a double life and it's running right now."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   That's the thing about Apple is they could always surprise you.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Well, almost certainly there is an ARM-based Mac inside Apple.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   For years.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And there has been a long time.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   For years.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   But I think you're right, Andy.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   They're waiting until they can deliver a reasonable user experience.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   We kind of know this already from Windows.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Microsoft has been offering Windows on ARM for some time.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And the early versions, even Microsoft's own versions,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   are woefully slow.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And as a result, not very desirable.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   What you get is long battery life, like all day battery life.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And you also get built in things like LTE, but you don't get
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   as performance in any reasonable fashion.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   That's why even though I often will at least mention how it is
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   to be using a Chromebook versus a MacBook using a Windows notebook
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   versus a MacBook.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You can't do that kind of direct one-to-one comparison between,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   you can't say that Apple should be doing this thing that is omnipresent
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   on Windows machines because the Mac universe is so much different
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   than the Windows universe.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   They really don't have the ability to put one super, super slow machine
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   into the lineup because that's going to suck so much attention
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and so much bad support as tickets away from their main
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   line of Macs.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Whereas in Windows, there are people that desperately need a $200 notebook
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   that they can buy 40 copies of.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   But that's not something that Apple has a need to do or an interest in doing.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   So we shouldn't really complain that certain things in the Windows world
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   is not going to happen on the Mac end.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   It's easy to hope that Apple takes inspiration and takes notice
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   of how popular certain features might be, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   it's appropriate for Apple to do that at least at a certain point in time.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   All right, so the new MacBook is here.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   It's pretty good looking.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's very expensive.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   If you have a need for speed, it seems like a good choice.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Don't worry about something newer and better coming out in two weeks.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   On the other hand, it does bode well, I think,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   for other announcements on June 3rd at WWE.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And I think Apple is really making a concerted effort to show,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   not just tell, but to show that they're going to be updating Pro stuff
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   not just a normal, but at a well-considered clip from now on
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   because they went years with slow updates.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   That was no good for anybody.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   All right, let's take a little time out.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   There's still lots more to talk about.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Andy Inako, Renee Ritchie, Lori Gill, Mac Break Weekly is on
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   the air brought to you today by FreshBooks,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   the number one accounting software that makes your billing easy and painless.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I know that because I used it for years and voided.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   It saved my cookies.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I hate making invoices.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   I hate it with a passion because I didn't get into podcasting and broadcasting
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   because I loved sending out bills.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I bet you if you're a business owner,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   you didn't get into business to send out bills either,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   but you got to do it to get paid.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   FreshBooks makes it easy.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And what's really cool about FreshBooks is it starts with invoices.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   FreshBooks lets you create and send invoices except credit card payments
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   within the invoice, which means it's easy for clients to pay, in fact, on average.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   FreshBooks users get paid twice as fast.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   But it does a lot more and ultimately it is accounting software.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I hate to use the A word because that scares people.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   But no, this thing makes it all painless.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   You can log every expense.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   In fact, there's a FreshBooks app for iOS and Android that means you can snap a
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   picture of a receipt, log it, get it into the invoice if you bill for time and hours
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and expenses.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And by the way, speaking of hours, you can time yourself with the app or the website.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   You can even have different rates for different projects from the same company.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   You'll stay on budget for every project because you'll know exactly what you've spent
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   at every point.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And let's see, if you've got your invoices, that's accounts receivable.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   You know when the invoices get paid, that's income.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   You know what your expenses are because you're tracking that.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   In fact, you can even automatically have FreshBooks log into your bank and get
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   expenses every day.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I think if you have all that, you have, yes, you have your balance sheet.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   You know if you made money.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   It's one thing I never knew as a freelancer until tax time.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Did I make a profit this year?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   You'll know every day.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   You could just look at your FreshBooks dashboard.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   You'll know exactly what your budget is, where your stand, track your productivity.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   The reports are great too.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   So easy to understand, and yet it has all the full accounting reports you might
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   need a tax time.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I liked it because I was billing Rogers in Canada, so I needed to bill it in
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Canadian dollars.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   That was always a pain for me.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   FreshBooks does the currency calculations automatically for currencies
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   everywhere in the world.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Tax calculations too.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And because it's a web app with a web based dashboard, it's changing.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   They're adding new features all the time.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Look, you're constantly evolving to keep up with your customer demands,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   the demands of your business.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   FreshBooks does the same.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   To ensure you have all the information and tools you need to understand and
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   grow your business.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And that FreshBooks mobile app has revolutionized the software accounting
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   world.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Imagine being able to communicate with clients, get paid, organize your expenses,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   all in the palm of your hand.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   It's that easy.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   FreshBooks, no wonder FreshBooks is used and trusted by small business owners in
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   over 120 countries.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   24 million people now have used FreshBooks.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I'm one of them.

[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   I love Asymco.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   I love him.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Yes.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Who is his horse?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   -Aress?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   -The first idea.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   -Aress?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   -Did you?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   -He has a podcast.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   -No, he's finished.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   He's Swedish.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   I forget where he's from.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   He's from Scandinavia.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   -Oh.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   -So I've always pronounced it.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   -You used to work at Nokia.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   He really knows what he's talking about.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Great post couple of days ago called The Pivot.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And The Pivot, of course, is Apple's Pivot from selling hardware to selling
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   services.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   We've talked about this kind of ad infinitum, but he really breaks it down.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   He says, "No business is a good business if it's static."
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   So while the iPhone has been a great business, the iPhone's story is not
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   static.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   The Pivot's or changes in direction are several.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   The store was the first.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Accessories.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   That became...
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Remember when Mac Break, I'm sorry, Mac World Expo became the iPhone
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   accessories expo, right?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   The whole thing.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Distribution through multiple channels.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   They started with AT&T, but they slowly expanded not just in the US,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   but all over the world.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Integration with other Apple products, most notably the Apple Watch.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   The marketing of older products alongside new ones, it reduced prices.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Expanded product portfolio with a broader range of prices, traded in
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   financing options.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   That was a big boost to iPhone sales when you could bring your old iPhone
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   to the Apple store and get a discount on the new iPhone.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   And those financing options made it basically interest free.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   You just pay over time.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And a lot of people, I think, have taken it knowing that you're always going
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   to want the new iPhone.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Well, that's fine.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   You pay a monthly fee.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   In fact, it worked so well.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It was copied by most of the carriers.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Each of these initiatives or OS rights or Horace or Horace rights,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   whose contributed to the iPhone growth story.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   But the biggest change in the business model was, as we've pointed out many
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   times, addition of services.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Apple services grew out of the iTunes business that predates the iPhone.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   It was originally designed to provide content for the iPod, as you might
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   remember.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   In 2006, the year before the iPhone launched, Apple customers spent $3.3
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   billion on iTunes software and services.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   That's actually quite a bit.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   But by last year, 80 and a half billion, it's possible this year spending
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   rate will reach $100 billion.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   In other words, a 30 times greater than back in the past.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   The businesses that Apple gets yelled at for being the worst part of Apple's
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   business are still bigger than almost all other businesses.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Some would argue that-
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   That was also 80 billion per year.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And I don't know if that was intentionally unclear about the 3.3
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   billion on iTunes in 2006.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   That could have been 3.3 billion to date.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Right.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Whereas the 80 billion is per year and possibly up to 100 billion per year.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   So yeah, those numbers are huge.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I mean, just phenomenal.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   One of my favorite things about Apple as a company, just speaking with someone who
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   used to work in marketing and have to deal with a ton of different companies,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   is that, I'll go so far and say they've never mistaken their product for their
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   business.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Apple was never the Mac company, never the iPod company, never the iPhone
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   company.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   They've always been, we provide this product, like the shiny product to
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   consumers' company.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And you look at a lot of other companies, they have one hit product and they, yes,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   you can maximize profit by writing that thing into the ground and preventing
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   anything else internally from ever trying to like, hurt it.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   But that thing will eventually be driven into the ground and then you'll have
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   nothing left.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   And Apple's always, you know, you have the iPod and then the iPhone is coming and
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   you have the iPod, but it'll get even bigger and we have the Mac, but the iPad,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   but the iPod's not doing what the Mac is doing.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Well, and they've been very good at balancing sort of just ongoing product
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   cycles and never getting too attached to any of them.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   His, Horace's point, which I think is really insightful, is Apple is not a
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   product company.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Apple, since this is a deception, he writes, has always been oriented.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   It's customers, not its product.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   The questions asked by management are, what can the company do to deliver
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   experiences and satisfaction to our customers rather than what most
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   companies wonder what products can the company build?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And I think that explains these multiple pivots because it isn't really a pivot.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   It's just saying, what else can we do for our customers?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Not what other products can we offer?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Tim Cook will often say we're a differentiated experience company.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   They want to go to a market and find something that they can do that nobody
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   else is doing in a way that makes their customers happy.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And that's sort of how they determine all these things.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And it's especially interesting because the prices have gone up, but
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   their hardware margins have gone down and down and down.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   If you look at them over the years, they maxed out shortly after Tim Cook took
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   over and then went down.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   By the way, the software goes up and up.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I should point out that as true as that is for Apple.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Much more true in other PC businesses that margins are now razor thin.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Apple, even despite decreasing margins, still has very, very strong margins.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   But the services margins, Leo, that those tasty services are.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   It costs you nothing.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Right?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   What is the market?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   80%?
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Zero incremental cost or something.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   So long as there's electrons and copper, Apple still makes money.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   The way this is kind of laid out, the way this is laid out to me, it reminds me
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   sort of music and bands.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And I kind of liken it to the rolling stones over their entire lifespan of
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   music have always mostly been exactly the same, but kind of asked
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   themselves musically how they were going to sort of stay relevant without
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   you.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   They still play brown sugar at every show.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Right.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   No, and that's what I'm saying though, is that they're trying to stay
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   relevant without changing too much.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   But look at somebody like Madonna or Lady Gaga who is constantly
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   reinventing herself.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   I was actually thinking of, so my analogy here is that, you know,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   a band like Rolling Stones who has managed to be one of the most popular
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   bands in the world for their entire existence versus a band like
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Metallica who quickly, completely changed what they sound like and they
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   failed and I know that they're still very popular.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   But they, they.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   It was quite a collapse.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   So, so it's like Apple is being the rolling stones or in your analogy,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   the Madonna of changing while staying relevant all at the same time and not
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   changing yourself so much that you don't keep the core that you have.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   You know, your, your user experience in this case for Apple being the most
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   important thing instead of like other companies are, they are changing their
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   products based on technology instead of keeping their products in line with
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   what, what consumer experiences.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Right.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   And as bad as it's been for Metallica, I have to point out they're still doing
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   better than men without hats.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I'm not on the.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   See that's, that's, that's the, that's the problem of a non-forward looking
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   business plan because they don't wear hats.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   It's, that's their brand.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   People can see how gray and bald they are.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Exactly.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   People really live their youth.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   But yep, it's, it's Apple.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   The one of the Apple's greatest assets really has been its culture, which is,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I think an Apple realizes that and that's why so much, once you get above a
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   certain level in the company, they really want to make sure they really
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   send you to Apple University in which you learn about the Apple culture.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   This is, this is how they can have plans that change according to the
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   market, but still make sense for what Apple wants to do.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   So they are, my perspective has always been that Apple's a design company that
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   expresses its love for design chiefly through hardware, which makes the pivot to
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   services a little bit different because there's something about a tactile object
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   that is, that you can do that you can't, it's a, a sort of primitive caveman,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   cave woman sort of joy when you're holding a beautifully sculpted object
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   where the buttons are in the right place and things light up in the right way that
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   you can't get by creating a new way of recommending music and apps to people.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   So that's kind of a shift, but it does mean that they can bring that philosophy
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   at least to a market where they're, let's face it, they have a lot of challenges
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   because you're not, when you, when Apple showed off the iPod, they were showing
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   off something that people really hadn't seen before.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Dido for the iPhone, dido for the iPad, dido for the, dido for the first Macintosh,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   whereas now it's like, hi, you know how you've been using Spotify for several years
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   now? Well, now we have one of those and know how you've been using Amazon
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   music and Hulu for a while. Well, now we have one of those. So there's a bigger
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   challenge to them to make sure that even in an area where they can't really
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   revolutionize, they can still create that environment where human beings are still
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   going to be very, very pleased to use their, their, their services.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Renee, I wanted to make sure they, I, I pointed this out, Renee made a brilliant
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   comment. I think it was a few days ago about maybe how, I don't want to put words
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   in Renee's mouth and Renee will definitely correct me if I'm wrong, but that
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Apple might have missed a really big opportunity by getting out of the home
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   networking hardware business because if one company has the ability to,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   networking is still a, it's, it's still a ball of her. Now it's like a ping pong ball
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   instead of a bowling ball, but it's still a ball of her. And if you can take,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   take that problem of why am I not getting onto the internet and exactly
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   tell me where the point of failure with. And I want to make sure that my kids are
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   safe on the internet all the way down to one of the highlights of Apple's
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   app, Apple's portfolio, just privacy, safety and security and saying we have put
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   into the hardware, making sure that you are not going, no one is going to be able
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   to send you information or pull information through your web browser or
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   track you in ways that you don't approve of. It's a yes, this is why this is a $200
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   box on your network instead of an $80 box on your network, but you're going to be
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   much happier with your whole internet experience because of the Apple logo on
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   this box that you never even really interact with directly.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   I do, I would add one being Mr. Negative.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I would add one little bit, which is, I completely agree with Apple
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   has succeeded because they say, what can we do to make our customers happy, not
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   what products can we build. But there is a back end to that.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Once you get people into the fold with Apple's been also very good about doing
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   is locking people in. And I don't think you can downplay
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   the power of the ecosystem play, of the walled garden play that Apple's made.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Once you're in the Apple walled garden, once you're an iPhone user or a Mac user,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I think there's a considerable speed bump to moving out of that
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   universe. And that's something clearly Apple has done
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   intentionally. And they can make lots of excuses for how it benefits
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   the consumer, but ultimately benefits Apple.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   We get back into the base of the broad concept of the transaction
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   between the company manufacturing the product or service and the consumers.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   I think that with Google again, you're making a transaction, meaning that you'll have
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   freedom to use other services. It won't cost you anything, but realize
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   that we are making these services and making them so cheap and so well
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   because we are collecting data about you. And we might try to
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   work very, very hard to make that as transparent as possible and give you control, but
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   our business is observing what you do and figuring out ways to improve
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   the products that we sell to other people. Apple's transaction is
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   we don't care about your personal information.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   We care about other people not having access to your personal information
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   even if it's us getting access to your personal information.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   We will give you reliability, we will give you a fit and finish that
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   when you walk into an Apple store and you buy a laptop with an Apple logo on it,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   there is no possibility that you're going to be buying something with a keyboard
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   that flexes in half with a processor that really can basically do
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   maths, longs you force it to a long division. But the
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   transaction is that it's going to be hard when you switch from
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Apple services to another service or from Apple hardware
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   to a lesser extent to another piece of hardware. So I think it's legitimate.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   I don't think it's a cynical ploy to keep people locked in. I think that just like Google's
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   relationship with its users, it kind of Apple appreciates that
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   airdrop is the easiest way to move a file from the device in your hand to the device in your
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   desktop and that's because Apple can control absolutely everything
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   about their transaction. When you try to get a phone, I try to get something
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   just even from my Android phone made by Google to my
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Chromebook made by Google, it's nowhere near as easy. So you're getting
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   something to return. So long as the user and the customer is aware of what their
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   transaction is, I think it's okay.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Yeah, it's a pain in the butt too.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   I prefer open to be honest.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's definitely a win for Apple and
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I just wanted to point that out. Guy had to add the negative. I'm just saying.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   He finally... Well balanced. Well balanced. Well balanced.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   He always says at the end, a priorities driven company which
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Apple has habitually redesigned its processes and resources.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   A resources or process driven company redesigns its priorities
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   as its capabilities change. And that seems a recipe for
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   a disaster. Keep your priorities and
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   make everything follow that rather than, oh, I guess we can't make
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   laptops anymore. Let's figure out what other priorities we might have.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Waffle irons. Yeah, that's what you get. Moving as it does between
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   computers, devices, software services, retail logistics and manufacturing
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   means Apple's not classifiable as a particular
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   industry sector company. Rather, the company should be classified by the set
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   of problems it seeks to solve. Communications, community productivity, creativity
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   well-being. I think that is a very positive
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   gloss on Apple's business model but it certainly would explain Apple's
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   great success. I thought it was a well done article
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   and makes an excellent point. Let's see
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   what else has been going on in the world of Apple.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   They had a big... I think this is interesting. They did not yet
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   have the opening ceremony for Apple Park, not until
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   yesterday. The stage wasn't ready Leo.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   They have a big ring. You gotta get Gaga. You gotta wait
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   to see what Gaga's not always available. But can we talk for a minute?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Don't pass up that opportunity, man. Apple's approving a vertical video in that picture
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   they like to. I thought they were posters at first but then when you see the actual
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Instagram stories, they're the world's biggest Snapchat windows.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Oh, God. That's, you know, that's ten. I'm going to be completely
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   honest. As soon as I saw that picture, I knew, oh, God, there's going to be
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   so many people everywhere complaining about vertical video.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   So last week and I... I wish I'd seen this. Last week
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Drone footage showed this mysterious rainbow stage appearing and I wish I'd seen that so we could
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   speculate on it last week but this week on April... I'm sorry, May 17th, Apple held
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   a formal opening including a concert on that rainbow stage
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   by Lady Gaga. Wow. Yay.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Yeah. And it was a tribute...
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   It was a tribute to Steve. Tim Cook thanked
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Lady Gaga for a performance in a separate tweet. "We came together today in the home you
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   imagined for us and celebrated your spirit. We love you,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Steve." And it is true. This was kind of Steve's last great creation
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   was Apple Park. So pretty nice. I guess it was Zane Lowe
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   of Apple Music who got
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   Gaga to come to Apple Park. She thanked him in her
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   tweet. Here's Tim's tweet for Steve Jobs. There's
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Gaga. Tim also tweeted, "Thanks to the incomparable Lady Gaga for helping
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   make our celebration unforgettable." And that is by the way,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   at one of the outfits she wears in her fine performance in
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Nigma in her Las Vegas residency. I know because I saw it.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   And that's her Nigma haircut
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   as well. Apple really...
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   That is part of its corporate culture. They really have kind of a fan-boy
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   relationship to people in the arts and that goes all the way back to the people
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   that Steve Jobs and the rest of the Macintosh team chose to give the first
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Macintosh's to. Like there's this list named someone who was really, really
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   important from 1983, 1984 and earlier. And they have
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   one of the original Macs out there. And I was just...
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   I was on another forum someplace talk about this with other people.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   And I just had to list all of the amazing live musical acts
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   that I got to see just because I attend Apple Keynote's and Apple
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Press Functions. And just the ability to see Foo Fighters
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   doing a four or five numbers set in a venue that holds maybe
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   750 people.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Oh my God. Seeing you two in a room of 150 people,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   none of whom are standing up with their phones or yelling woo
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   right over the quiet parts of anything. It's quite...
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   This is a real touchstone. This is...
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   This actually looks like a big part of Lady Gaga's Enigma Show. It looks very similar to the Enigma Show.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   She does fly in on a wire in that show. And I doubt she did that in Apple Park.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   But this is... The wind alone would produce.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   I mean this is not a five song set. This is a big,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   big show, an hour and a half show I think. So very nice.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Very nice. And... I have a question. Thank you Apple for putting
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   that on YouTube. 54 minutes. All 54 minutes if you want to watch it.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Shot by somebody in the audience in vertical video.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   I don't know how long before this gets pulled down.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   You might want to run and get it.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   If you're a Gaga fan. Okay. Just a warning to the producers.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Because I've been in it at home, my bandwidth might go down for an understanding.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   And by the way, in her set,
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   she did a moment of silence for Steve Jobs. Which is...
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Which is pretty cool.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   It's class. Very nice.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   So congratulations. There was a rainbow staircase
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   put in at Apple Park. I think that's kind of cool.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   He paused his redesign of the pearly gates to look down and smile.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I bet he was pretty darn happy. That is what a tribute to Steve Jobs.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   His final great product.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   And again, that is a really beautiful structure to do a live performance from.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   I'm sure that his designs could be broken down and put back up.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   But I think that in all the drone videos we've seen
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   of Apple Park, it's a beautiful simple ring.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   And with greenery inside it. But when you put that pop of color right in there,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   it really does start to look like a park and the meeting place
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   and hang out place where people can use their devices.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   They're not allowed to use off campus. Like real people will.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   It shows you that they're not that the design team at Apple.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   They're not one trick ponies. When they want to make a stage, it's like,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   "You know what? Let's not make it out of undifferentiated aluminum.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Let's make a big rainbow." And we're not even going to have reinterpret the original apple colors.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   We're not going to say, "Oh, this is sort of a buff orange and sort of a tangerine green."
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Like no, Apple was founded on those colors just as bright as that.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   And that's a celebration of everything that Apple is. It's really gorgeous.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   They've been there. They might have taken them a little longer to get those colors just
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   with just right.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Now, here comes Mr. Darkseid once again.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   The composer of... Please, Mr. Darkseid is my father. Call me Lyle.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   No, you're stepping wolf.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   The composer of Somewhere Over the Rainbow is suing Apple
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   and Google Music. Not because of that stage.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Apple Music and Pandora and Amazon and Microsoft.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Because apparently Harold Arlen's songs, actually Harold Arlen's son,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   because Harold's no longer with us.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   But his songs are being sold by a variety of different unauthorized versions
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   being sold by a variety of different companies on those music systems.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   And really isn't Apple's fault or Pandora's fault. I mean, blame RCA Victor.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Don't tell the EU that, Lyle. We have no idea how they're going to react to this.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Yeah. Arlen's attorney said it's hard to imagine that a person walking in a tower records,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   we better tell him they're gone.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Off the street with an arm full of CDs and vinyl records claiming to be the record label
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   for Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and LFS Gerald could have succeeded in having that store sell their copies
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   directly next to the same albums released by the real labels, but at a lower price.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   That's actually not a good analogy because pirated music is often sold in record stores.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   And I visit record stores regularly, like weekly.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   So I do have some experience with it.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   So that's a bad analogy because pirated music is actually available in record stores very, very often.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   But it's still a good one.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   What, how are these determined as being pirated songs versus licensed songs by other companies?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Because you can license music from RCA in Columbia, for example,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   and put out your own version of an album or a compilation or something like that.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   And I'm not exactly sure.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   There's just not enough information, this article for me to understand how the consumer is making this claim
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   that it's actually pirated music and not licensed music.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Yeah, they're saying unauthorized and you're right.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   And I don't know.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   It doesn't, pirated is probably not the right term.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   Unlicensed, probably.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I'm going to guess is you have to pay a license fee to the publisher, whoever owns the public.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Whoever owns the publishing rights of a song to re-record it.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   They say one online retailer selling a song from the Jamaica cast album.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   The record label is soundtrack classics.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   It's 99 cents alongside the licensed copy of the song from RCA Victor for a buck 29.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   The cover art of, oh, it's pirated.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   The cover art of the soundtrack classics version has been doctored to remove RCA Victor's logo.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   So it is in fact a copy of the cast album with the trademark stuff removed.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   So that sounds like definitely sounds like piracy.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   And that might be a reasonable lawsuit to say, well, these companies, Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Pandora need to pay better attention.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   They need to do better policing about the songs they put in their store.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   That makes sense.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Absolutely.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   They're not eBay.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   They can't just say that we don't sell things to people.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   We are a marketplace where people come in and we're not responsible for screening every single purchase.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   But no, this is like an actual functional, not dead version of the tower records in the sense that at some point somebody at Apple looks at every single product and decides whether it goes into the store or not.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   And that gives Apple a certain amount of responsibility.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   So yeah, I don't know how far it's going to go.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   But remember that part of what made the Supreme Court decision that the class action suit of those four iPhone owners about the Apple store monopoly.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   One of the interesting things about it was that the Supreme Court at least made the position that look, you're not big tech companies.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   You're not going to be able to get away with defining your relationship with your customers in a way that relieves you of all the burdens that you would traditionally have if you were a more traditional company.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   If you are selling apps to consumers and you get sued for how you do that, you don't get to say that, oh, no, no, no, we are an app store service that we sell to developers because of the merits of that particular case aside.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   They pretty much said that selling whether you sell it in, whether you sell it through the gears that turn to turn the thing that you are selling to go to the users and the users might go into your pockets is kind of irrelevant so long as that's the relationship you have with these people.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   So it could be an interesting look at how this is going to work.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   There's also a precedent already set for this. I think Napster is a great example of it. It was a site that was hosting pirated music and therefore was claiming no responsibility for the pirated music that was being provided, but then they were sued for it and successfully lost the case on that.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Actually Napster, that was the point of Napster, which was that they did not host it. They provided links to the songs hosted on somebody else's computer. So that they said, well, that lets us off the hook.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Apple is not in that. It didn't. An Apple is not in that case because they do host those pirated albums.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   So they're asking for not a huge amount of damages and this is spread out over those five companies. It's the maximum statutory amount, but it's only four and a half million dollars.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   More importantly, I imagine to the Ireland estate is that they stopped doing it. And I think that if there is widespread piracy, I didn't even aware of this widespread piracy on these music stores, they ought to knock it off. That isn't OK.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   >> Yeah. It's also really bad for the consumers, particularly if you're looking for, oftentimes I'm looking for like a showbiz recordings and jazz recordings and from the 40s and the 50s.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   And a lot of times you say, great, well, here's exactly the performer and exactly the song I'm looking for. And there are 18 hits of which one might be the legitimate one and you get a digitally remastered, beautiful recording.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   And then there are ones where it looked like it was recorded off the radio somewhere.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   >> I completely agree. And that happens to me all the time. If you want Ella and Louie, you want the real thing from the record company.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   So I guess we can all do our part two when you buy music on these digital music stores, try to get it from the original company, the recording company, because that's going to benefit the artist better than some pirated version.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   >> So I feel like my awareness has been raised. I think that's good.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   >> You do know when you search for stuff on any of these stores, you get a ton of crap.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   >> The weird stuff too is you get an international version. I was listening to some music that Georgia was playing it and it was songless that I knew, but I was certain it was not the right people.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   And it turned out it was like the Italian cover of this old brand.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   >> I knew it. >> You saw it. >> But she didn't know it. She just pressed the buy button and got it.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   >> That's a real thing because it's less than it used to be. But for the longest time, if you wanted to get Gene Wilder singing the imagination song from really walking in the chocolate factory, for whatever reason, the people who owned the rice to that had not put it into the iTunes store.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   >> But you would hear clearly somebody, a professional modern recording of someone clearly trying to sound like Gene Wilder using the exact same sort of orchestration where it's an uncanny valley sort of thing where it's, you don't much rather have a different cover version because your brain is telling you this is Gene Wilder, but it isn't.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   And so whenever there's a vacuum, people will try to fill that vacuum commercially if they can get away with it.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   >> People are awful. So I heard it on. >> Preaching to the choir, man.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   >> That's why you and I Andy wander the streets alone.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   >> I don't know why we let this what let this planet live, but you know what? We got big hearts is what we got.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   >> I heard it on three NBC crager when senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners around 2013 Apple bid for Tesla through $240 a share, which kind of interestingly is more than the current Tesla shares are worth.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   The analyst didn't disclose his sources, but he added this is something we did multiple checks on.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   I have complete confidence. This is accurate Apple bid for Tesla. I don't know if it got to the formal paperwork stage, but I know from multiple different sources, this was very credible.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   That's an interesting point and especially now that Tesla is valued at less than $240.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   >> Just let Elon keep tweeting and they can get it for a steal.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   >> In fact, I remember I interviewed Ashley Vance about his biography of Musk and right about that same time,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   March of 2013 Vance writes that Musk reached out to Page, Larry Page of Google saying, maybe you'd like to buy Tesla.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   He proposed Google buy Tesla outright. Would have cost about $6 billion plus $5 billion in capital for factory expansions.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   Remember Tesla and Apple both now have autonomous vehicle divisions. Not quite the same as Tesla.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Tesla is making cars with some autonomy.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   >> Can you imagine YouTube and AdSense on that big Tesla screen wheel?
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   That's a blank camera.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   >> I am really, I am driving a Tesla disclaimer Model X, but I'm very tempted because in July my Tesla lease runs out.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   I'll have to buy a new car and I'm trying to decide is it worth investing in this company?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   I can't tell Elon Musk about a week ago at an event said, we estimate that next year there will be, what did he say?
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   I can't remember some huge number of Tesla's self-driving Tesla taxis out in the world.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   It just sounded nuts. He said, we know from our stats that about 80% of the time Tesla's are not being driven.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   We're going to build in a switch that would let the driver say, okay, turn on autonomy, let somebody rent me out until I need it again.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   That's going to put millions of Tesla's on the road.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   >> Is he a special version of autonomy? It's better than I'm looking for.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   >> This is a full economy. This was an event called the Tesla Autonomy Day.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   >> And he and I have snow storms that would disagree with him.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   >> This is John Louis Gasei writing about it.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   So John Louis knows a little bit something about this stuff.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   He says, I'm listening to this and the song played in my head. They're coming to take me away.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   On the other hand, you don't know with Elon.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   >> He said there will be a million Tesla robo taxis on the road next year.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   Next year he tweeted Tesla did a Tesla musk did.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   Model 3 drive unit and body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life current battery module.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   So you'd last three to 500,000 miles.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   Basically he's saying Tesla owners will make money.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   The average Tesla's currently parked for 22 hours a day starting next year.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Owners will be able to flip next year.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   Owners will be able to flip a switch inside the Tesla app, send out their car to pick up and drop off passengers
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   autonomously earning an estimated 65 cents per mile in fares.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   You could make as much as $30,000 from your car a year.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   So now I want to buy a Model 3.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   >> I believe that's rubbish.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   I don't know.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   If he follows through on that, it's going to be that the software is there, the switch is available,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   but for legal reasons they are not allowed to activate it in your community.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   Obviously, like most of us fascinated by level five self-driving technology,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   I have not spoken to anybody who works in that industry who's actually designing and building this stuff,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   who thinks that level five, the way that we would responsibly expect it to work,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   is not going to be here for at least another six years.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   And most of them say about 10 years is roughly when they think that it's going to be as,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   it's kind of, I suppose the best analogy to make is there was a time when electricity wasn't homeless,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   but it was killing lots and lots of people because it took a while for everybody to understand that
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   you can't just have bare copper wiring inside of walls.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   You have to actually shield stuff.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   And that's basically where self-driving technology is right now.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   It'll demonstrate well, it'll work well, and you can actually have it up and running.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   But when it comes to, I'm going to be counting on autonomously driven vehicles for my mode of transportation,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   and I'm not going to expect it to be any more dangerous than stepping into a regular car,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   that is so far off that you just have to wonder if Elon was sipping his magic thinking juice
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   when he made that announcement.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   He's a good marketer here.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   But I have to say there is on my car in most Tesla's, something called "Summon",
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   which you could press a button and the car will back out of the garage and come and...
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   Acseo Tesla.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   Yeah, it's like Acseo Tesla.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   Pull up to your front door and be ready for you.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   Open the door and say, "Come on, let's go."
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   I have never...
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   I have never...
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   No! Are you kidding?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   I don't trust that thing.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   I was at CES with Lori, and I don't know if she was with me at this time though,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   but they offered us either a self-driving or a person-driving demo.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   And as much as I wanted the self-driving one, I chose the person-driving one
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   and the computer got everything wrong.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   The driver is like, "I know you're going right there, but it's telling me to loop around the city again."
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   And I'm like, "And this is a person driving if they're not in that...
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   I'm sure they'll be a safety person, but that system just did not work."
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Does that sound...
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Yeah, there's...
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   In Providence, there's a lot of...
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   There are now some self-driving buses and self-driving cars,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   and as it almost always happens, like it happened in Boston when there was a similar sort of thing going on,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   like, "Wow! What's it like to be in a car and no one's driving?"
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   Well, I don't know because there's a safety driver there, and that's what we talked to him.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   And then when we talk to him, he says that he only uses the self-driving mode about 15% of the time.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   It's like, "Yeah, we're really on the cusp of the breakthrough now."
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   Yeah. So, Night 201 in the Charum says Elon's dead and everything he's promised,
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   but maybe not on schedule, but he's getting it done.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   It'll happen sooner than later.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   You know, I'm not going to bet against Elon. I'm very happy with my model.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   Yeah, this isn't like an Indiegogo program. I'm not saying that he's fraudulent,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   but sometimes like many of us, we get really excited about this project.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   We're working on something that we think is going to take on a year to do,
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   because we're just going to solve these problems and stick to it.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   It's going to take five or six years, and that's why we have nice people
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   and nice suits who translate things from the CEO to tell to the press
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   to say that we are so far along.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Elon said that we are so very far along and wait until a year from now,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   we'll be able to show you something really interesting.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   But I think Andy nailed it though, that the hardware will be there
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   and possibly even the software just not enabled will be there in a year.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   Like Elon Musk says, it's just regulation alone.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   So I mean, he might be right. He might deliver on it that next year,
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   it will be in your car. It's just that not next year will it actually be able to be used in your car?
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   Yeah. And that's to say nothing of what Congress,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   what letter are you going to get from your insurance company when they're informed that,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   by the way, I'm letting a self-durali- my car be operated by total strangers
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   and operated in total self-driving mode.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   So someone who has absolutely no regard for this piece of property
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   and is going to be inside the car and it's going to be driven by a entity
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   that has absolutely no sense of how valuable its life is
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   because it can simply be downloaded and rebooted.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   So that's probably going to, that's going to be $35,000 in profits
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   and $38,000 a year increase in your insurance premiums for sure.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   We should mention that one of the things Elon is always talking about
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   is how we want to colonize Mars. That's like his next big thing.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   On Friday, I had a great interview on triangulation with Daniel Suarez,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   who's the author, what you love, Daniel is the author of "Demon and Freedom TM"
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   and so many great books. His most recent one is Delta V,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   and there's a very coherent argument in there about why we cannot,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   it would be insane to try to live on Mars,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   but he does offer an alternative and gives the scientific basis for it.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   I think it's quite compelling. Daniel has become a big advocate for space exploration.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   The book is about asteroid mining, Delta V, highly recommended,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   and if you want to know more about it, listen to triangulation,
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   because what number was that episode? I can't remember,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   but just go to twit.tv/tri, you'll see it right there.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Daniel's a great interview.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   Let's take a break more to talk about, including Tim Cook and his apology
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   to the class of 2019, but first a word from the fresh air.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Fresh air, I'm breathing right now, made by molecule.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   Man, if we do ever live on an asteroid, I want a molecule air freshener in the spacehab.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   Molecule is the state of the art in air purification.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   It is not a help of HEPA filter. You might say,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   if you do research on this stuff as I did, because poor Lisa was really suffering from allergies,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   we moved to the country, we have lots of pollen,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   petalamus terrible for allergies to begin with,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   we moved to like ground zero of allergies.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   She was waking up with stuffed up sinuses and a splitting headache every morning,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   did research on HEPA filters, and what I found out was HEPA filters were,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   that technology was created during World War II, and hasn't really been innovated on since.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   It's a filter, it captures particles, but they have to be big enough to be captured,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   traps them, and they're sitting there in the air filter.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   The molecule is the first breakthrough in this science,
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   and it does such a better job, because it doesn't trap pollutants, it destroys them,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   and it doesn't just trap pollutants of a certain size,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   it can trap and destroy pollutants 1000 times smaller than those a HEPA filter can catch.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   We put one in the bedroom, Lisa's headaches went away.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   In fact, I know if the molecule isn't working or has been turned off,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   because sometimes we have people come in the house and turn it off, I don't know why.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   Her nephew, just like any time he's house sitting, turns off the molecule,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   and she'll come home and she'll say, "It's off, I've got a headache."
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Then we'll go check and yep, you're right.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   The technology is absolutely effective, and created by scientists, tested by real people,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   it's a fantastic relief if you're an allergy sufferer or an asthma sufferer.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   One customer, maybe it was Lisa, said that if using a molecule she's able to breathe through her nose
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   for the first time in 15 years, funded by the EPA,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   molecule was verified by third parties in university laboratories,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   It has a PICO filter, a photoelectrochemical oxidation filter.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   It has a pre-filter that's kind of like a HEPA filter,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   but then the PICO traps tiny things like mold, allergens, bacteria, even viruses,
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   even volatile organic compounds like fumes from paint and formaldehyde from your carpet,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   and destroys it.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   It's incredible.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   A beautiful design, a lot of people say it's the apple of air purifiers,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   it's got a solid aluminum shell.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   You can pair it to your phone using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   I do that because it will automatically notify you when the filters get low.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   In fact, you can even have it automatically order new filters,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   you never have to worry, I've always got them.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   It lasts a long time.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   We change the filters maybe every 90 to 120 days.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   It really lasts a long time, but you don't ever have to run it without a refill.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   The refills are automatic.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   You can control it, but you don't have to from your smartphone.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   It does have a controller right on the top so you can turn it on and off.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   I always said it to silent mode.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   Lately, they said though, because the pollen has really been bad,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   she's turned it to auto mode, and so it automatically ramps up or down to match it.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   It worked so well.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   We got one for Michael, our son.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   We have one in the studio now, which I imagine is on silent mode,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   but it's doing a great job.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   Molecule.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   All right, I've sold it enough.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Go to Molecule.

[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   I think you will too.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   This is not snake oil.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   This really, really works.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   I know because Lisa tells me what it's not.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   Molecule.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   I hear about it.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   Headache.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   Check the Molecule.

[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.720]   Tim Cook, it's graduation time.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.000]   I went to my daughter's college graduation on Saturday.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   I know I'm so proud of her.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   You know who spoke?
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   It was awesome.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   She got an honorary degree.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   Joanna Hoffman.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Oh, wow.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   She's the Russian emigre who yells at Steve Jobs in the Steve Jobs movie.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   The "Denny Boy" one.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   Remember?
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   I think she played by Kate Winslet.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   I think she was.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   She comes in and she's the only person who could say boo to Steve.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   Joanna Hoffman worked at Apple.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.840]   She was on the original Macintosh team, wrote the business plan and the first marketing
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840]   plan for Macintosh.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.160]   Later went with Steve to next.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.480]   Later went to General Magic where she was instrumental in creating the first smartphone.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.640]   Amazing woman.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   Great story.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   She told her life story.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:51.800]   She came from Russia at the age of seven, spoke no English, and talked about how she
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.720]   integrated.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.320]   Her major was archeology.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.040]   She was fascinated by physics and archeology.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.480]   It was just very lucky Steve Jobs loved her, hired her, and the rest is history.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.920]   She was a great commencement speaker.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:13.840]   Tim Cook spoke to the class at Tulane University, the class of 2019.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.600]   That's in New Orleans.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.600]   It's a big school.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.360]   They had the entire super dome.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:24.840]   The Mercedes-Benz super dome where the Saints play for their graduation.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.240]   He said a few interesting things, including apologizing for our generation.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.120]   He said, "We really screwed it up."
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   Is that Gen X?
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.120]   What generation is that?
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.120]   The greatest generation?
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120]   He's younger than me.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   I'm a baby boomer.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.760]   I don't think he's a boomer.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   He's a boomer.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   He's a boomer.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.560]   He's apologizing for the boomers.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.920]   Yeah, we did kind of screw things up.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.320]   I apologize for the boomers as well.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.360]   He didn't teach us what suffering was Leo.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.680]   He took everything for granted.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.600]   Yeah, there's a lot of things.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.760]   He says, "In some important ways," I wish we have the video because I'd like to, in
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.200]   some important ways, much generation has failed.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.600]   When I do it, it ends up sounding like Bill Clinton.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.040]   By generation has failed you.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.120]   We've spent too much time debating and have been too focused on the fight, not focused
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   enough on progress.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.920]   I guess he is a boomer because he's only four years younger than me.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.080]   He says, "You don't need to look far to find an example of that failure."
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:26.480]   Of course, he's in New Orleans where Katrina in 2005 just destroyed the place.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.240]   Here today in this very place with thousands, once found desperate shelter from a hundred-year
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.720]   disaster, remember the superdumb was home to a lot of people flooded out.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.920]   The kind that seemed to be happening more and more frequently, nudge, nudge.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.200]   I don't think we can talk about who we are as a people and what we owe to one another
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.720]   without talking about climate change.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.880]   The problem doesn't get any easier based on whose side wins or loses an election.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   True.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.120]   It's about whose one's life's lottery and has the luxury of ignoring this issue and who
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120]   stands to lose everything.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.320]   Of course, when you're talking about the class of 2019, including my kids, they're going
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.040]   to be a bear in the brunt of climate change in their adulthood and later.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.440]   The coastal communities, he goes on to say, including some right here in Louisiana that
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.680]   are also making plans to leave behind the places they've called home for generations
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.480]   and head for higher ground.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.680]   The fishermen whose nets come up empty.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.200]   The wildlife preserves with less wildlife to preserve the marginalized for whom a natural
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:30.320]   disaster can mean enduring poverty.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.840]   He goes on and talks more about climate change.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.960]   I won't go through the whole thing.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.680]   The final coda, though, I think is very apt.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.720]   Whatever you do, don't make the mistake of being too cautious.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.520]   Don't assume that by staying put the ground, this is apple.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.000]   Don't assume by staying put the ground won't move beneath your feet.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.800]   The status quo simply won't last.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.440]   People aren't going to buy the iPhone forever.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.480]   So get to work on building something better.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.000]   I added the iPhone part.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.680]   Tulane tweeted, "You may succeed.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.780]   You may fail, but make it your life's work to remake the world because there's nothing
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:14.480]   more beautiful or worthwhile than working to leave something better for humanity."
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.720]   That's very true and that's a message all of us.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.040]   Baby boomers should take to heart.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.880]   But if you went to more, you got your student loans paid off.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   Wow, I know.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   Morehouse University.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.040]   How many invitations is that CEO going to get for a keynote address?
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.120]   It's probably right of Smith.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.040]   So one of, I think, 19 black billionaires speaking to a traditionally black college,
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.760]   Morehouse University says, "Your student loans are forgiven."
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.600]   By the way, they interviewed a number of people.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:48.840]   People had, and this was what depressed and shocked me, had loans of $70,000, $90,000.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   $200,000.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   Isn't someone that worse than you?
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.840]   Can you imagine, anyway?
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.680]   Yeah, if you paid all four years, if you borrowed to pay for all four years, that's
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680]   $200,000.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.680]   One of the people said you'd have to pay half his salary for the next 25 years to pay off.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.280]   I just didn't want to think that that college degree is worth that, to be honest.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   You know what?
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   I feel the same way.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:16.160]   I had a really sobering, I won't say conversation because I overheard two teenage checkout clerks
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.000]   at my local market talking to each other because they are high school seniors and they're
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.200]   trying to figure out what schools they want to get accepted to and what they'll do.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.600]   That was really all they were talking about.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.400]   The only college that I and my parents can afford is community college.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.160]   She said, "Community college, as far as she's concerned, is like four more years of high
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   school."
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.120]   She's not as affordable as community college is.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.480]   It's not worth her spending all that money for a degree that's not going to be, that's
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.320]   not going to translate into more opportunities and more earnings in the future.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.880]   I just remember thinking about how I went to Rinsular Polytechnic, not a cheap school.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.880]   I got scholarships and I got aid and all kinds of stuff.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.000]   Between me taking out loans and my parents taking out loans, I paid off my student loans
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.080]   within like five years, eight years, maybe something like that.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080]   That's working as a freelancer.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:17.320]   I just have so much respect for the kids today trying to figure out this problem of assuming
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.320]   hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and entering the bottom of the workforce and knowing
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:25.520]   that they're going to be spending five, six, seven years before they even start to pay
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.680]   down one dollar of the principal.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.120]   This system is so screwed up.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:38.080]   It's really is if I see teenagers and people in their 20s coming over the hill towards me
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.720]   waving the red banner of revolution, I'll run towards them and pick up a flag for them
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.520]   because I feel as though A, I should be on their side and B, they've got a legitimate
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:51.120]   beef and they will desperately hurt anybody who do argues with them that the system needs
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.120]   changing.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:58.960]   Yeah, when I was a kid, the story that was always told to me is that getting a college
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.160]   degree will improve your life.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.480]   The numbers showed it.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.240]   The year that I graduated from college, I think might have been the last year that that actually
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:16.800]   was true because the market dropped, the economy dropped, and people who had college degrees
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:24.160]   and well paying jobs were losing all of those jobs and then taking jobs beneath their experience
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   because they needed work, which pushes all of us college kids back further and further.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.120]   Now, you can't really say to a teenager, to a person that's just out of high school,
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:39.560]   you can't really say to them that your college degree is going to get you a better experience
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.600]   on life because right now, that's just not the case.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.840]   I agree with you, Andy, so much that my heart goes out to these young people, especially
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.480]   people who have gone through college and are now trying to join the workforce and it's
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:30:00.920]   not as easy as it was when I graduated from college even, which isn't even that long ago.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.920]   There's nothing that you can hand to them that says congratulations from graduating from
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:05.920]   college.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.040]   Now you have to move back in with your parents because you can't find work because you're
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.840]   just graduated from college.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.800]   The knock on effects are, I was ashamed of myself for not appreciating this until I'd
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:25.840]   read about this in a really good piece, I think, of the New York Times that if most of your
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.920]   time and income has to go towards paying down your college, but that here are things that
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.000]   you don't wind up buying, you don't wind up buying a house and you certainly don't wind
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.400]   up starting a business and maybe you decide that I can't afford to have kids.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.680]   And so we're the risk of having an entire generation that did not have the ability to
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.840]   build wealth, that to have a piece of property that they own and then can leave to their
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:53.160]   kids or sell or growing a business that they can use to hire other people and generate
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.400]   wealth that they can put back into the community.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.560]   Or again, you're 48 years old and you finally feel as though you're kind of on top of your
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:06.200]   finances, but now do I want to be a parent at age in my 40s and early 50s and not send
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.360]   them off to college that I can't afford until 70.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.480]   It really is going to be a huge generational problem and it's like it's as depressing
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.720]   as Tim Cook's speech about how global warming will probably kill your great-grained kids.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.200]   And gosh, I'm sorry about that.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:27.080]   Now I'm going back into my suite at this brand-new $80 billion office complex.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.680]   It's going to be far worse than debt.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:35.720]   This is going to be a really big scar on our society that we will never be able to rub
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.720]   away.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.000]   Wow, and I thought I was sorry.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   Please, please.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.760]   You can talk about something fun now like the whole while I've asked me.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   Also, you can congratulations on your daughter graduating.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   If there's one-
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:56.680]   If there's one accomplishment, I don't say this to rub it anybody's face, but it's one
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:00.600]   accomplishment I feel like I've made in my life is that both my kids are graduated from
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.600]   college without any debt.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   That's great.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.080]   That's more than I did as a kid.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:11.400]   It's more obviously you guys same thing, but I think it's really, yeah, I feel very fortunate
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.480]   that I was able to do that.
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.440]   And it's thanks to you, podcast listener.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440]   Thank you.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:21.720]   It's a word for you.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720]   I don't know what I do.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.240]   Yeah, we got some bad news this week.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:30.800]   Oh, this is kind of inside baseball, but there is a I've I've invaded against them in
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800]   the past.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:38.240]   The interactive advertising bureau are IAB, which is a group that essentially represents
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:43.880]   advertisers, as you could probably tell by the name, but they represent advertisers in
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.400]   mass and they're sticking it to podcasters.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.960]   Who does your metrics for vector Renee?
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   Who do you know?
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.040]   The download metrics download numbers.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.240]   I use Libsyn for the hosting and they provide numbers.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.720]   Yeah, most and a lot of people do.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:03.640]   We've always used a company called Podtrack.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.240]   Advertisers are increasingly required that you use an IAB certified download.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:14.840]   I don't understand why they want that because there needs to be a standard, right?
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.360]   So that because some companies claim millions of downloads when in fact all they're telling
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.920]   you is their number of server hits.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.920]   So it's important that there be a standard.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:29.640]   The unfortunately, the standard that IAB has created is a significant.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.800]   They know lower number.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:35.680]   We've just been informed by our by Podtrack, who does our measurements.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:41.280]   IAB says they're compliant, but they are not certified, which was a kind of a shock to
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:47.640]   us and they told us that starting June 1st, they will be fully compliant, adherent to
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.960]   IAB numbers.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.960]   They said expect a 20% drop in your numbers, which is 20%.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:34:01.080]   In fact, it's a significant cost, millions of dollars, because we will have to make goods
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.520]   and all sorts of things.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.200]   I don't know how this is the upshot of this is going to be, but we feel it's unfair.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.400]   We use Podtrack's numbers, but we've done our own counting.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.760]   I think we come up with a number that's very, very accurate as to number of people downloading,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.800]   but it is a higher number than the IAB number will end up being as far as I can tell.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:24.320]   So if you're a podcaster, be aware of this.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:29.920]   If your sponsors require IAB certification for your download numbers, which I expect
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:36.320]   everybody, every advertiser, every agency will eventually ask for, be prepared because those
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:42.680]   numbers in our opinion, I don't know what we can do about this, in our opinion, are artificially
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.280]   lowered, which is of course what advertisers prefer.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.720]   Yeah, it's curious that it goes naturally.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.040]   The chief issue seems to be, and I'm going to have a technical call after the show today,
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.040]   so I'm going to find out more.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.000]   The chief issue seems to be something called deduplication.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.040]   When you use a podcast client, say overcast to download, sometimes these clients will
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:08.360]   open multiple streams to the down loader to speed up the download, which is fine.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.040]   But that then looks like you're downloading, let's say overcast opens five streams to download
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.240]   Macbreak Weekly.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.120]   If you were only counting downloads, you would get five times the downloads from that one
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.160]   person.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.560]   So we do something called dedupping.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:29.360]   We look at the IP address and we do not count it more than once per hour.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.560]   If so, any hits we get from that IP address in one hour count as one person downloading
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560]   it.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560]   That seems fair.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.840]   It does under count because if you're an Apple employer, Microsoft employee, all Microsoft
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.560]   employees appear as a single IP address.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.920]   So even if 10,000 Microsoft employees download a show, we get one download.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.040]   So we understand that.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.200]   That's we kind of built that in fine.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.600]   But we want to make sure the deduplication number is accurate.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.080]   The IAB apparently dedups over a week.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:06.520]   So if anybody from that same address downloads a show more than once a week, it counts as
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.280]   one download.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:14.040]   And that is, I think the primary reason there's a 20% depreciation in the numbers.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:19.440]   It makes sense if you're a weekly show, I guess, but Vector is going to get hit by that because
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.440]   you do how many shows a week?
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.040]   Yeah, four to five.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.880]   So you're going to count on an 80% drop in numbers.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.000]   So that's not good.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.280]   Could we ask people at Microsoft and elsewhere to like always download our podcast via a VPN?
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.280]   So they'll get like an in-pit.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.080]   They'll get their own IP address.
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.440]   So it won't count as just one number.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.280]   I don't know what the answer is going to be.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   By the way, I'm being corrected.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.720]   Patrick says it's not one week.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   It's one day.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   So that would be okay for Renee.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.720]   Okay.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.880]   I kind of make, I think I understand their reasoning behind this, but it's been our experience
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.840]   that different family members might download it and still appears that we feel like if
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:04.160]   you download it after, if you, we get another hit from that person after an hour, most of
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.280]   the time that's a new download that should be counted as a new download in any event.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.360]   There are other reasons, but we're expecting a big depreciation.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:17.440]   And the only reason I bring this up, it's not about Twit or Mac break weekly, but I think
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:22.400]   for people who listen to podcasts, and I know that's you, because you're listening to this,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.840]   you should be aware that this is going to be an advertiser-enforced big hit on every
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.120]   podcaster you know.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:36.760]   And you know, if you wonder why podcasts go out of business over the next year, you wonder
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.760]   no longer.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:40.600]   We've been kind of waiting for this to happen.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.440]   And now has the other shoe.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.960]   Thanks, jerks jerks jerks jerky jerks.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   We love our advertisers.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.160]   Yeah, the advertisers are amazing.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160]   It's never the advertisers.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.600]   And it's reasonable that they would want some sensible way to do it.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.720]   I don't know if Libson is IAB or not.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   You should check.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   I don't see anything.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.720]   I'm looking.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.800]   I think they're not as I remember.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.920]   So it's going to be interesting to see what the shakeout is on that.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.360]   It's going to hurt us by if all of this is the case.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.800]   Like even on event days, while like upload three, four at a time, you know, that'll just
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800]   be disaster.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.800]   So we'll see.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.640]   We'll see what happens.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.160]   Interesting story about WhatsApp.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.000]   We have reported did we report last week about the WhatsApp hack?
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.560]   This was fixed by WhatsApp almost immediately.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.720]   So it was last Monday.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.760]   So I'm expecting we mentioned it the next day.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.400]   But it did bring up an interesting issue.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.480]   First of all, you might have the most beautiful and pervious iPhone ever made.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:51.120]   But if you've got a third party app on there with an exploit like WhatsApp had, those iPhones
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:57.720]   were completely compromised to the point that so the way this zero day happened and
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:04.680]   it was we believe it was a nation state that was calling dissidents and journalists, they
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.600]   would make one phone call, even if you didn't pick up on WhatsApp to your WhatsApp number.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.440]   That's why it's a targeted attack.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.800]   And the WhatsApp would in effect give them full access to the system to the point where
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.240]   they could erase the fact that that phone call even happened.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.240]   Now that seems odd.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.360]   It seems like Apple would prevent WhatsApp from impacting the rest of the phone.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.080]   But as far as we know, it did.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.000]   But this raises a more important issue.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.400]   And this is Lorenzo Franceschi Biket, writing in motherboard.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:40.200]   This has shown us it's almost impossible to tell if your iPhone has been hacked.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:46.000]   The iPhone is so locked down, security researchers are complaining that even if you had this
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.760]   flaw, we can't tell if the zero day happened because we can't get into the phone.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:57.000]   Only Apple could really tell you your thoughts.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.360]   >> I wonder about packet and we've seen no matter what the system we've seen stuff
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.600]   successfully hidden for years.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.520]   So there's no cure for this.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.000]   And you could probably pack it and expect it.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.600]   I'm guessing anybody who's terribly concerned about this is doing the ultimate thing and
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.880]   that is burning new phones on a daily, if not weekly basis.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.440]   And that's about all you can do is just burn it down restart it or have a dispenser roll.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.680]   If your job requires absolute security, have a dispenser roll of burner phones just constantly
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.880]   available to you.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.120]   >> I was just the same thing with this is.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120]   >> Go ahead.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.000]   >> I was just saying the important thing with this is that you always, it's the same thing
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.520]   with the zombulan things.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:46.560]   You have to factor in your threat model into the threats and to figure out what is the
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.120]   likelihood this will happen to me and what precautions I need to take.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.000]   Because what will affect somebody who is a dissident being targeted by this country,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.120]   by a nation state is different than somebody who's just out fishing all day with their
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.560]   flip phone.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:06.040]   >> The issue also is it makes it hard to know how many zero days impact the iPhone.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.040]   They quote Zuck Abraham who is at Zimpyrium, which is one of the big good guy, White Hat
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.240]   Zero Day companies.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.880]   They don't make them.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.320]   They reward people for finding them.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.240]   They act as a marketplace for companies that want to know about zero days.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.440]   >> Zuck Abraham said in the last few months he's seen a lot of targeted attacks against
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.120]   iPhone users.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:31.000]   So many that it is quote mind blowing, but he declined to provide more evidence or details
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.560]   about the attack.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:38.800]   Jonathan Levin, who's a security researcher who's written books about iOS and macOS security
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.960]   says in his opinion, so few iOS zero days have been caught, not because they don't exist,
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.240]   but because they're worth a lot of money and are likely to be used in targeted attacks.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.680]   He also said to exacerbate the situation.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.320]   Payloads are often tested and perfected for weeks or more before deployment, thus ensuring
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.320]   a high chance of exploitation and inversely a low chance of detection, especially in the
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.840]   case of zero-click attacks, which this was requiring no user interaction.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.920]   Unless Apple makes fundamental changes, this is zero, but another security researcher,
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.320]   in how iOS is architected, there's no practical way to tell that an iPhone got infected.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320]   Yikes.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.320]   >> So what would they change as being?
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:25.880]   >> What I'm hearing from this, what I'm hearing from this is that the iPhone is so secure
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.680]   that you can't tell if it's been hacked.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.880]   >> I wouldn't use the word secure.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.720]   I'd use the word locked down.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.880]   So don't conflate them because, well, in fact, another security researcher says that Apple's
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:46.200]   strategy, this lockdown strategy, this quote security strategy works against hobbyist attackers,
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.440]   but it is quite counter-productive against professional attackers.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:55.800]   >> So then what's the solution though, in this case, is make it less locked down, which
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.800]   therefore means make it less secure?
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.600]   >> No, I think this, I will submit, my guess is the way to make it more secure is to give
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:09.080]   security researchers access to this in some form or fashion.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:15.840]   This is one of the complaints against the DMCA and the restrictions against reverse engineering
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.600]   is that it's very important that security researchers can bang on this stuff to find
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:21.720]   this stuff.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.480]   If a system is so locked down or protected legally from this kind of--
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.360]   >> If it's obfuscated.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:35.080]   >> Or you can't legally attack it, then you're going to become less secure as a result.
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.400]   It's kind of an oddly contrarian result.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.040]   That's why you hardly ever hear about these things happening to Linux distros, not only
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:52.240]   because there's practically no one using them numerically speaking, but also because
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.000]   if you go for a completely open source operating system and running completely open source
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.800]   software, at some point, somebody has banged on it.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.880]   People will even bang on complain about things that are working perfectly fine in the open
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.080]   source community, let alone things that are security problems.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.520]   But it's an interesting point of view.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.440]   It also points out that there are so many exploits that will always be in the wild but
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:19.520]   will never be heard of because they're way too valuable to disclose and also because
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:22.880]   sometimes governments and law enforcement basically says that this is our secret, this
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:28.640]   allows us to snoop into phones of people that we need to check, suspects and criminals.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.800]   And so the last thing we want to do is for Apple to patch this thing.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.560]   >> And it's prawn in our chat remade a point.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:40.280]   For instance, if you could just even show what processes are running on an iPhone, you could
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.600]   at least see if some of the processes are unauthorized.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.840]   I mean, there would be ways without making it less secure to make it easier to inspect.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:50.200]   >> It's hard because a lot of them are really good at hiding too.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.160]   And I was thinking about packet inspection, but they're very good at bundling that kind
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:56.400]   of stuff up too.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.960]   It's an interesting problem to solve, just architecturally speaking.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.760]   I think their goal is just to keep hardening it.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.520]   And there was this thing going around saying that the iPhone, that iOS 13 is going to be
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.680]   practically un-jailbreakable.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.280]   They've gotten it to a point where it's locked down enough that you can't even jailbreak
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.000]   anymore, which is both good.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.720]   Again, it's good and bad.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:21.560]   That takes a year, two years to break through each time.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.360]   But I agree with you that I think there should be, Apple has these bug bounty programs.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.520]   I think there should be some provision for people who are white hat hackers or security
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.680]   researchers to be able to get in.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:36.720]   Because no internal amount of testing ever equals a million people pounding away on your
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720]   code.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.720]   It's just impossible.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.120]   >> And the open source thing is great too.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.120]   But if it's not popular, we've seen open source exploits, even in popular systems last
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.280]   for years, because nobody looks at that particular hunk of code.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.200]   >> Yeah, just because because the more people doing it, the better.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.200]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.200]   >> Yeah, right.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:57.840]   >> And would it be possible for Apple to release an official Apple iOS utility that does nothing,
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.560]   but take a look at all the processes that are running on this phone.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:09.080]   And at least say that here there are 92 processes working, we know of 89 of them.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.400]   And we know that they're not bad processes.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.160]   But here are three processes that if you've got on the phone to somebody who's a security
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:22.000]   researcher and they tell you that XX skull skull skull death to all kamakomers might
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.320]   be a bad thing.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.560]   >> Apple really has a responsibility to make sure that we have the ability to at least
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.400]   to know what's going on inside our own devices.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   And if they can't necessarily make them open enough that we can do it ourselves, I think
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.640]   that that's a big opportunity and responsibility for Apple to provide us with those tools that
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.480]   can give us at least the information we need without compromising what they feel to be
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.480]   the integrity of the device.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:47.920]   >> It'd be my guess if Apple takes it seriously that there will be.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.000]   I mean, I think it's possible to keep the phone absolutely as secure as it is, but give
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.240]   some sort of window into what its operation is.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.920]   >> What are the configurator or the enterprise tools have way better clarity into what's exactly
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920]   running on the device?
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:01.920]   >> MDM, yeah.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.160]   >> Yeah, MDM or just the iPhone configurator that you can download.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:07.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.240]   >> It is a wake up, a little bit of a wake up call that this WhatsApp thing was able to
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:15.160]   give you complete access to the iPhone and complete control of the iPhone.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.440]   That's a scary thought.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:23.520]   Online though, to reassure everybody, iPhone is very secure.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:29.640]   And as always, if you are the target of an attack by a nation state, you're in trouble.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.800]   It's going to be, that's a challenge.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.120]   These guys have resources far beyond those of the average bad guy.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.720]   And it's very hard to keep the nation state from compromising.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   >> This is the stuff.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:47.000]   >> This is why journalism continues to be a very high risk job for so many people, in
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.600]   so much of the world.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.160]   >> That's absolutely right.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.520]   We shouldn't ignore that.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.760]   All right, let's take a little break and we'll give you one last chance to commit journalism
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.560]   with your picks of the week.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.560]   >> To hit.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.560]   >> Oh, wash my hands afterwards.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.560]   >> Yes, yes.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.320]   "Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.040]   Now that you know how dangerous the world is, maybe you want to think about protecting yourself
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.360]   when you're on an open Wi-Fi network or even your Wi-Fi at home, a virtual private network
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.920]   encrypts your data from your computer to the outside world so that no one can snoop
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:26.360]   on you, your ISP can't see what you're doing or where you're going, the hacker at the coffee
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.200]   shop can't attempt to get into your system.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.760]   And it gives you some other benefits, including the elimination of geographic limits because
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.360]   with ExpressVPN, they have servers all over the world.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.440]   And you can emerge on the public internet in the country, practically any country, the
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.440]   country of your choice.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:48.560]   ExpressVPN secures and anonymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data and hiding
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.560]   your public IP address.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:55.400]   Of course, with any VPN, it's important to check the VPN because you're going to now
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:58.600]   rely on the VPN company to protect your privacy.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:04.480]   And I can tell you from personal experience and news stories, ExpressVPN does exactly
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.480]   that.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:06.480]   No tracking.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.120]   They have no way of knowing who you are and they do not share.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.680]   They have no information they can share with anybody else.
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.760]   And boy, is it easy to use.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.400]   They've got apps that run seamlessly in the background of every device you're using, whether
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.720]   it's a computer, a phone, a tablet, one click, you turn it on, one click, you turn it off.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.960]   And it means you don't have to worry about snooping or hacking less than $7 a month.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.600]   I know people always tell me, but yeah, I can get VPN XYZ for free.

[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.760]   You believe in it too.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.720]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.840]   Oh, I know how dangerous it is to recommend something on Kickstarter.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.840]   Oh, but you know what?
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.920]   I know what we're going to recommend.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.440]   I bought it too.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.680]   Yeah, I know this is so this is a travel tripod, which doesn't sound really exciting until
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:43.840]   you take a look at it and take a look at the video and realize that my God, some someone
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.560]   who has been annoyed by tribe tripods for 30 years finally applied some engineering to
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.560]   the problem.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.080]   And by the way, we should say peak design has worked with some of the best photographers
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.080]   in the world.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.280]   They are a superb company.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:01.040]   I use their peak bags, peak straps.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.440]   They're fantastic.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.120]   So these guys are photographers.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120]   They know photographers.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120]   Right.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:11.040]   As far as design goes and as far as delivering on Kickstarter's, this isn't just some dude
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.480]   ordering stuff off of China.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:18.040]   So the big deal is that they've made like a full size travel tripod that is so super
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.520]   compact because as they say in the videos, the one thing that will get people to buy
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.120]   this that they realize that the biggest problem with tripods is that most of it in your bag
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:32.000]   is negative space because they're the tripod legs are like round cylinders.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.560]   So they basically created their wedge sort of like the shape of them are like a arc tube.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:47.120]   And so it all collapses down together and fits together into one solid cylinder of aluminum
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.880]   or carbon fiber.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:57.840]   So it is actually about the size of Pringles can scaled up just a little bit and not only
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:04.480]   that, but they created a tripod head where instead of having three knobs like on my travel
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:11.080]   tripod for up down left, right, you basically twist one knob, which remember where you want.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.760]   They have and just look at this part of the video.
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:19.200]   They say, well, you know what, there is the hollow tube for the central support is hollow.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.200]   We can put something in there.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:26.600]   I know less design a phone, a tripod mount that just will handle any phone and you can
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:30.480]   just simply store it inside that central leg.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:36.080]   And again, if I wrote down a list of everything that annoys me about tripods, I have four
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:40.680]   or five because I choose one based on which problems I don't want to deal with in this
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.040]   situation.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:47.120]   And this one is nope, this has all the best features of every single tripod I own, including
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:51.200]   the most important one being small enough and light enough that I will throw it in the
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.200]   bag.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:56.200]   Even if I don't necessarily know I'm going to get a tripod because that's the problem
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:01.800]   you have these great, oh wow, wouldn't it be great to just set up a slow motion video
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.600]   or slide up a time lapse or do lots of bracketed exposures.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.960]   Oh, well too bad I didn't bring my tripod, but hey, I did.
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:11.400]   So it's not super cheap.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:20.440]   It's about $280 I think for the $289 for the aluminum one and $479 for the carbon fiber
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440]   one.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.600]   Unfortunately, it's running for 60 days.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:31.000]   So I already spent my mad money for the month already for May.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.560]   So but next month I kind of really have to buy this one because it really is.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.400]   My mantra when people ask me about buying the new version of whatever is always that
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.120]   anytime you buy something particularly tech or photo related, if it doesn't solve a problem
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:48.320]   or create an opportunity, you probably can do without it.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.000]   This one solves a problem and creates opportunities for me.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.400]   So I don't like spending $290 willy nilly, but oh my god, do I ever have $290 for this
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:58.400]   thing?
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.400]   I don't want to wait.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400]   I don't want to pay full price later on.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.560]   I want to get it as soon as possible.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:06.360]   Yeah, I immediately I saw it on petapixel this morning and I immediately ordered it.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.080]   Because a tripod is an important thing.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.960]   And I always pack it, but it takes up a lot of space and this is brilliantly thought out
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.520]   and I have peaks bags.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.280]   I have peaks straps.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:19.360]   Trey Radcliffe worked with peak early on to create great bags.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.840]   And so I don't know if Trey worked on this tripod, but it looks like he'd be a pretty
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:23.920]   approved for sure.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:26.760]   I found out about him from this from Trey's Instagram.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:33.440]   So this was as this also made me feel funny because oh my god, I'm just like the Kardashian
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:38.920]   fans who like he saw someone on on either fan of somebody on Instagram or they recommended
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.240]   something and now you're buying one.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.240]   But no, no, no, this is right.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.240]   Right.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   Cliff is awesome.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.800]   He's not just pushing something against his face and taking a selfie and clicking a
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.800]   check.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.160]   I'm sure this is something he believes in.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.840]   He's the kindly genner of nerds.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.840]   He's okay.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.800]   We can follow him into the darkness.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:00.320]   No, good pick.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.840]   Would have absolutely been mine.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.200]   I ordered it immediately and I'm glad you're going to be able to get it next month because
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.880]   it is considerably cheaper.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.880]   Like 100.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.000]   The expensive was a hundred twenty one bucks cheaper than it will be.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.880]   So you know, you do get a pretty good discount.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.880]   61 bucks for the aluminum.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.400]   If you order it now, kickstarter.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.320]   I have really sworn off kickstarter.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.440]   This is different because it's peak.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.920]   Great stuff.
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:26.920]   Laurie Gill, your pick of the week.
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.040]   So this week I'm not choosing a product.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.000]   I'm going to have some good things like in the week after.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.520]   Well, you save up because there's some good ones coming up that I can't tell you about
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.480]   yet because they're not ready.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:46.240]   But this week I just wanted to pick the new pride watch face on Apple Watch because it
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.520]   brings joy to my life.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:51.200]   Not just in that it looks really good.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.400]   But one of my favorite things about the way they designed the new pride watch faces is
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:03.680]   the when you tap them, they ripple and the more you tap them, the more they animate.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:10.120]   So I just love tapping on my watch face just to watch them sort of jiggle and wiggle around
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.160]   all the time.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:15.400]   They're beautifully designed and pride month is and it starts in June.
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:22.640]   So get ready for a pride month with your watch face for a pride this month.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:28.920]   And if you happen to have a pride watch band to go along with it, that's great too.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.920]   I just, they're beautifully designed.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.920]   They're just gorgeous.
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.720]   I hope they make more like this, not just for pride but for anything because to me this
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:37.880]   is one of the best.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:44.040]   It's better to me than the liquid Apple Watch face and the other motion related ones.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.440]   It's just so, I don't know, it's a really wonderful, beautiful, lovely looking watch face that
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.440]   I think everybody should have.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:53.400]   I look at it right here on my wrist.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.200]   You can see I'll do the ripple.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:02.040]   And just like tap it a couple of times and watch it get bigger.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.640]   Yeah, the more you tap it, the more it is.
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:07.640]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640]   That's nice.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.640]   This is the analog one.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.040]   This is why as an Android user, I still want an Apple Watch.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:17.400]   And I like the analog because it has four complications on it, which I am a big fan of
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.400]   the complications.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.320]   So it's got to have those.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:21.480]   That's really pretty.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.960]   Love that.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:23.960]   Thank you, Laurie.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.960]   Good pick.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.480]   And that's free if you got watch OS, what is it, five, the newest or is it four?
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:35.080]   Watch OS 5.2.1, which it came out, I think, on the 13th.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.880]   So it's been over a week now.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.440]   I think that it's been very nice.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.920]   I guess that leaves you, Renee.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.080]   Your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.560]   So I'm making up for Laurie and again, pulling an Alex because I'm recommending the only
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.280]   cast of the Oculus Quest.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:51.280]   Just came out today.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.600]   Yes, this is owned by Facebook and that does give me the Wiggins because I still find them
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.920]   to be a toxic organization.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:05.160]   But Oculus, I had the Oculus Go and what I really liked about it was that it was essentially
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:09.880]   air pods for your face and that it had everything built into it that you really needed for a
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:15.600]   VR experience, which is really different than at the time, especially the tether to a PC,
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.440]   to a hardcore gaming PC that other headsets required.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.080]   And a lot of them have Wi-Fi rigs now and things, so it's much better.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:25.880]   But this still is one light, small headset.
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.000]   It's heavier in the front because it has to carry everything and it's not the same resolution
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000]   or graphics.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.400]   It's a mobile chipset because it's in the headset.
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:41.000]   So I just, I got it and I downloaded the Darth Vader game and I got to play around with some
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:47.200]   lightsabers and they have a lightsaber version of Tap Tap Revenge as well, which is awesome.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.200]   That sounds like fun.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.400]   And it's just a lot of fun.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:55.880]   I created my own account, did not sign in with a Facebook account and that was my one
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:57.360]   allowment to do this.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.080]   I didn't have to log back into Facebook to do it.
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.080]   But I'm looking forward to trying it out.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.080]   It is my first day.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:05.160]   I only got to try it a little bit.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.360]   So I'll have more details on it soon.
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.080]   But I'm still a big fan of VR.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.840]   Like if you want to just, I watched my God kids play it.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   I watched Georgia.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.600]   She has like three or four of them in her basement now and they just all play these
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.720]   online like dungeon crawler games together.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.960]   And it's just, it's just really absolutely amazing experience.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.960]   >> That's really absolutely amazing experience.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.360]   >> It's just gonna make a video of that.
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.000]   >> Oh yeah, it's great.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.880]   Like they're all slaughtering Orcs and attacking dragons in the same, or I think they do it
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.880]   in different rooms.
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:35.760]   And each other, I think at this point now, but they're all playing together still.
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.880]   And it's just, it's an amazing thing.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.480]   It's different than AR.
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.640]   And I don't think one has to win and one has to lose.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:47.560]   I think we'll eventually have a graduated set of experiences from augmented layers of
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:51.880]   information to full AR objects to full VR environments.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.560]   And I'm super happy about that.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:59.040]   >> Don't you love how jealous we can be about kids and the toys that they have?
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.040]   It's like, oh man.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.480]   >> But the goofiest thing for that was-
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.480]   >> Go ahead.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:07.880]   >> So I guess the goofiest thing about that is you will give them full in depth cutting
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:11.240]   edge AR and they're super happy and then you will show them Pac-Man.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:15.240]   And that's just as new to them and they're just as happy.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:20.040]   >> Although there's a bunch of crawling in your basement.
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:20.960]   >> Sounds like a lot of fun.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, Andy.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:27.400]   >> No, I was gonna say there's, there is still one of the basic wonders of humanity
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:33.160]   and childhood is that there is still as much play value in an empty paper towel tube for
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.080]   an eight year old as an advanced AR system.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:44.080]   >> My pick of the week is not quite so fun or exotic or even expensive.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.160]   In fact, it's free.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.000]   If you, I like LISP, call me crazy.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]   >> Parentheses and me go together.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:58.280]   Normally if you're a LISP programmer, you're probably running e-max and slime on your, on
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:02.000]   your command line or, you know, from your terminal.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:09.120]   But there is an easy and I think very acceptable way to get into LISP on a Macintosh.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:10.720]   It has been for years.
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:16.720]   There's a free program called ClosureCL, C-L-O-Z-U-R-E, ClosureCL.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.960]   But it was sad because it didn't work on Mojave, but they fixed it and it does now.
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.840]   It also works on OS X if you want it.
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:29.640]   But the Mojave version is great because they have a REPL, a listener window and a text
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:30.800]   editor window.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:36.200]   You don't have to, all that configuration trouble with the e-max and slime makes it very easy
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.120]   and a great way to get into LISP.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:42.720]   I think LISP should be everybody's first programming language, absolutely.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.960]   Or a LISP-like language, actually my favorite is Racket, which is based on Scheme.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:51.920]   And this is a great thing you could put, you could, by the way, Dr. Racket is available
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:54.560]   on Mac as well for free.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.760]   But this is, if you're interested in LISP or you want to play with LISP, this is a great
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:01:59.760]   way to do it.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:02.440]   ClosureCL is a very good LISP, C-C-L.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:09.120]   And it's available once again on Mac OS on Mojave, highly recommended.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.880]   And I know I'm spitting it in the wind with this one, but still, that's my pick.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:14.880]   Now.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.840]   It's time to say goodbye to all our family.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.440]   I hate that when that happens.
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.320]   He's got to go rift.
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.640]   Mr. Renee Riff-Ritchie.
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:26.640]   I'm more.com.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:27.640]   Catch him on Vector.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:32.160]   You're going to do a thing on your Oculus on Vector?
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:33.160]   I will.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.360]   I just, just right before the show uploaded the MacBook Pro video, so now I'm going to
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.760]   work on this.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.720]   And I have a Huawei thing with Ben Behar.
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:43.200]   I needed a big brain to talk about all the Huawei stuff.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.480]   If it will impact Apple and Google and Microsoft and how.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.720]   And so I got Ben Beharan on, so that'll be up tomorrow.
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:49.720]   Super cool.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.720]   Super califragilistic.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.720]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.720]   Andy Anaco.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:53.720]   Thank you.
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.480]   We'll see you on WBA, GBH in Boston, when?
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.680]   Actually, I was just on yesterday.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:04.000]   And that's a great show to watch, not for me, but because John Waters has a great interview
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.640]   on the show for half an hour.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.880]   I did get to meet him.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.800]   I did get a picture with him and I did get him to sign my laser disc of serial mom.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:12.800]   Wow.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.000]   He is just amazing.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:21.720]   At 72, he is just still the same John Waters that made movies with Divine in the 70s.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.720]   I'm just...
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.680]   Did you go and drag auditioning to replace Divine?
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:28.360]   Because I think you could perhaps pull that off.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:29.360]   I could...
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:35.280]   Well, no one could fill out a MooMoo like a let alone his shoes.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:42.600]   But I will say that that morning I was like, we have to look nice for John Waters because
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:43.600]   of this.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:44.600]   But not...
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:45.600]   So how about this tie?
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:46.600]   Like, "Chaibu, we're tied."
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.880]   No, I should be out.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:48.880]   So yeah.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.960]   I'm sure he appreciated the sideburns.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.400]   He still has the pencil mustache.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.800]   And it's epic.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:56.800]   If you...
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:01.480]   When you get to see it like from one foot away, it's like, my God, it's not like makeup pencil.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.200]   It really is just a dense line of mustache.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.200]   And it's like...
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.640]   I would not dare touch it because I'm unworthy.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.440]   But I felt as though like, if I could touch it, I would get some sort of magical mystical
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.240]   vision that would improve my life.
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.040]   Now you make me want to do a new show called This Week in Facial Hair.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:22.440]   Actually, he's touring with...
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.840]   Proning a new book, you might be able to get him for triangulation.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   That'd be fun.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:27.200]   And he would be incredible.
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:29.040]   That would be awesome.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.040]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.040]   Lori Gill.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.040]   Thanks.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:35.960]   Heart and Soul of the Fine Band, Sickburn.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.200]   So yeah, side gig managing editor at imore.com.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.000]   This is the other thing I do.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.680]   Yes, this is the other thing I do.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.040]   Anything else you want to plug this other thing you do?
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:46.040]   No, that's it.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.040]   Those are my plugs for the day.
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:49.040]   That's my plugs.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:52.680]   Go to iMore right now because we're covering everything about the MacBook Pro right now.
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:59.040]   I am literally two best friends away from level 40 on Pokemon Go.
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.560]   Oh, so close.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.640]   Two best friends away.
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.080]   I will do it today or tomorrow.
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:05.000]   I'm pretty sure because I've got...
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.400]   By the way, Karsten, we're one day off from best friendage and then suddenly you fall
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.400]   off the map.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.840]   Dude, open my gift.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:13.840]   He goes to you.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.840]   He goes to you.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:15.840]   I'm doing it right now.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:16.840]   There's several people.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:18.880]   If they open my gift, I'll be level 40.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:19.880]   Now, I'll...
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.880]   Victoria puts his egg on.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.400]   The bad news is that means the end of Pokemon Go for me, I'm going to unfriend everybody because
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:32.240]   I don't want to leave them hanging and delete the app because Harry Potter Wizards Unite
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:34.040]   is slowly approaching.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.640]   You're going to get your sign in the app for us this weekend.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:41.360]   I was trying to wait so that my wife would be best friends with me before you.
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.960]   Oh, I was wondering what was the holdup.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:44.960]   No, I'll do it.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.320]   Let me put down an egg.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:48.160]   We could do it on the air.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.160]   Hold on.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:50.160]   Wait a minute.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.160]   Wait a minute.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.800]   Show title Leo lays an egg.
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:58.240]   You got to put down a lucky egg and usually you get a chance to do that if you do it really
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:05:59.240]   quickly before...
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:00.240]   Okay.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.000]   Let me lay down the lucky egg.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.240]   The lucky egg is laid.
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:06.760]   Okay.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:08.960]   And that means I have 30 minutes for you.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.280]   Let me just quickly...
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:14.120]   Let me just quickly go over here because these are all my best friends including a guy named
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:15.880]   Renee Richie.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:16.880]   Love the old...
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:19.360]   Love the old Renee but he can't do anything for me anymore.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:21.400]   That's why I haven't opened any of these gifts.
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.400]   There's...
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.400]   Get done.
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:26.040]   There's Alsakx and Anthony GT40.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.040]   What about you?
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:28.040]   You're a day off.
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:32.720]   Davoff Pallet has been a day off for years, it seems like.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:34.880]   Be Fred Hill will get to be a best friend too.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.880]   That would put me...
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:39.360]   I would love to get to level 40 on the air right here.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.360]   Alright.
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.360]   Essentially a gift.
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.360]   I got your gift.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.880]   You opened my gift?
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.640]   I think that's going to do it.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.640]   I think that's going to do it.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.160]   Won't put me to level 40.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.160]   Let's just watch.
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:50.240]   Go ahead.
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:52.040]   Let's just watch as Karsten.
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.760]   Finally, my longtime producer becomes...
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.080]   Watch my screen Karsten.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:57.080]   I'm watching.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.080]   No, you're not.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.480]   Oh, I'm watching.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.480]   Let's see.
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:02.680]   Is Karsten going to become my best friend?
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.560]   Maybe I have to open your gift.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:05.560]   Oh!
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.920]   We are best buddies.
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:09.000]   200,000 points.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.360]   Well done Karsten.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:12.160]   Look where that puts me.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:15.160]   4.893 million.
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.160]   Wow.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:24.160]   I am just a mere 107,000 points away from the level 30.
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:26.560]   By the way, don't ever evolve lickatungs.
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:28.400]   They turn into the most boring things.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.880]   Lickalick is kind of hideous.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.640]   But this is keep your lickatung.
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:32.640]   Look at that.
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:34.000]   Who doesn't love walking?
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000]   I just keep walking with him.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000]   I don't want to evolve him.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.760]   You find them next to religious statues.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:38.760]   It's particularly...
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:39.760]   Is that true?
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:40.760]   No.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:43.280]   What we do here, because almost all the stops are at churches.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:44.280]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:47.520]   Do the religious statues taste like candy?
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:48.760]   Is that why Lickatur is like...
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:49.760]   Oh, time to flip.
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:50.760]   Oh, time to flip.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.440]   You could become famous forever.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:57.080]   If during this show right now, you would just open a gift from me, Devov.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:00.000]   You're just this close, or Anthony, GT40.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.080]   You're this close.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.520]   Fred, you opened one.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.520]   Oh, God.
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:05.520]   We're so close.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.520]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:09.680]   Those are the only people who could really change my life.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.200]   It would be over.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.240]   Maybe they don't want me to stop playing Pokemon Go.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.240]   Maybe that's the plan.
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:15.880]   It's a plot.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.880]   It's a plot.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:18.920]   God, I'm this close.
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:20.160]   You know what really annoys me?
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:25.680]   Because Lisa, this morning, got 600,000 points, three best friends.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.680]   But she's level 40.
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680]   She can't use it.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.680]   I don't know.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.680]   You never know, Leo.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:31.200]   You've been released new levels one day.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.200]   That's what she's saying.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:36.600]   She says, you know, what I want to have happen is they release like level 60, and I'm there
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:37.600]   already.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:38.600]   Because she's...
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:42.640]   I think about like 70,000, 70 million experience points now, but...
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.640]   You don't know.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.640]   Is there any way to know?
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.640]   No.
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:46.640]   So you go to the...
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.920]   You scroll to the bottom of the screen and it tells you.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.920]   Oh, really?
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:50.320]   You can see how many points you have?
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:51.320]   Yes.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.480]   If you scroll all the way to the bottom.
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.560]   I have 9.8936.
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.200]   I will tell her that.
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:58.320]   So she can see what she's got.
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:01.480]   So you need 20 million to get to level 40.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:06.040]   It only took me two years to spend years.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.040]   I don't even want to think how many dollars.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:11.040]   Yep.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.040]   I don't even want to...
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.040]   You're about to do it all over again for Harry Potter.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.040]   Shut up.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:17.040]   Nobody asked.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:20.840]   Don't you want Leo to be happy?
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:22.480]   Nobody asked you.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:23.480]   All right.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:25.320]   I wasted a lot of time on that.
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.320]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.320]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:28.320]   I really wanted it.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.960]   It would be so cool to get to level 40 during the show.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.120]   I'm this close.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.120]   Thank you.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:34.120]   You know with Gibson.
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.120]   Yeah, maybe during...
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.400]   Yeah, maybe during the security now.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.200]   Oh, Steve, by the way, don't mean to break in, but...
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:41.200]   Hey!
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.080]   Look who's level 40 who has two thumbs in his level 40.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.080]   This guy!
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:49.320]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.320]   Every weekly is shot before a live studio audience.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.120]   Well, there's a couple of people here anyway.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:58.000]   On every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.560]   That would be 1,700 UTC.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:04.000]   You can watch it live either by emailing tickets@twit.tv and stopping by.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.280]   We have a visitor from El Salvador in studio today.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:08.720]   That's nice to have you as well as Elsopradi.
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:12.160]   So the elves are in the house.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:16.000]   If you want to stop by tickets@twit.tv, you don't have to come here to watch live.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.920]   We do have live audio and video streams.
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:21.480]   All of them are aggregated at twit.tv/live.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.440]   It's the easiest way to figure out which one you want to watch.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:26.440]   If you're watching live, my goodness.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.920]   So are about 20 die-hard crazy people at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:34.080]   Actually, how many people are in that chat right now, ScooterX?
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.160]   It's probably a couple hundred.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:37.160]   We appreciate that.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.560]   We love the chatroom.
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:39.800]   Great bunch of people.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:42.280]   Dave C. He says, "Check now."
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.440]   Dave, are you devil of pallet?
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.840]   Oh, my God.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:50.080]   Let me quickly check.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:52.480]   All the thoughts have gone out of my head.
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:54.880]   We'll just wait.
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:55.880]   Oh!
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:58.800]   The dev off pallet.
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:00.680]   It's Dave C. in the chatroom.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:02.800]   I was waiting for you.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:03.800]   Oh, my God.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.800]   Play some music.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:06.800]   I am now level 40.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:10.440]   Get back to work because break time is over.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.240]   Congratulations.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:19.240]   Yeah!
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.680]   [MUSIC]
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.680]   (buzzer)
