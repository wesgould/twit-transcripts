[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And it's once again time to gather the group together to talk about the latest news from Cupertino to my left Mr. Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He's got the action league in full battle.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Excuse me those are the warring factors of the Avengers during the Marvel Civil War Maxi event.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   No idea.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Was I completely wrong? Is there not Justice League involved in there anywhere?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   No, no. That's D.C.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You got your cap America. You got your Tiger. You got your man, Comma Spider.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Oh, looks like a Spider-Man.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You got your cloak. There you got your dagger. I think I've made my point.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Okay. There you go.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That's not a comic nerd.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And Iron Man.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And Iron Man.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   If not the Iron Man.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And Iron Man.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'll swim with us from the wonderful Macworld magazine.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   The last paper publication still standing in the entire world.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's great to have you. Mr. Jason Sennell.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I mean, I ask you this every time.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Any chance. I mean, you're going to stay paper for a while.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yeah, it's people have to read something in the bathroom.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And at the airport, right?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And at the airport.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And at the airport. And at the airport.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's funny. The newsstand actually is doing pretty well.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I guess putting Apple products on the cover has a lot to do with that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But it's actually very successful.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah. That's true. I guess.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Since Apple is so hugely successful.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Right. I mean, if you were covering PCs, you probably wouldn't really have what...
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I mean, Macworld stories that are the PC world.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Right. You know, the PC world is the same company.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And Macworld does better, I think, because the Apple products are just more successful.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And fans will clearly step up.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah. And there are lots of iPhone and iPad users out there too.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We'll see when iPhone on the cover of the magazine.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Speaking of which, I love Super Bowl advertising.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I immediately realized that I am no longer a fanboy.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And I bought a Samsung note because of that ad.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Because of that ad. Because it's so honking big.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Did he also buy one of those gold boost d'a's that Madonna was wearing during the half-time show?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I did. I did.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And from now on, when I come on stage, I'm going to have oiled up muscle men pull my sled into the arena.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I think you're going to have an oiled up sheet of glass because of that big stupid thing you keep pressed against your face.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's only a phobic.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   When we're talking about only a switch to a different moisturizer.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I think it's the same glass that Apple uses even though they don't say so.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Hey. It's just more of it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Hey, are you guys hurt or laughing at the Samsung ads?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's why I bring this up.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Super Bowl ad.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Mocking. In fact, there's a whole series now.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Mocking Apple fanboys waiting in line behind the metal barricades for the next big thing in Samsung says.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The next big thing is all right. There it is already here.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   In this case, a phone with a stylus. Yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   That's what we need.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I think it's very nice of them to spend so much money during super bold prime time to explain that Apple has the hot products that everybody really, really wants.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And that at best this product they've spent so much time and effort designing can only be thought as a number two alternative to the device that people are actually lining up for.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   This is like their 1984. They're kicking over the barricades. They're free.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Free. They're dancing.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   They're free. They're free and running to listen to the white version of prints.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I know why.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That was weird.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is a really odd commercial.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's a very strange commercial.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, because they've got a product here that's interesting because I don't know if there's a real use for a device that's somewhere in the middle of size between a phone and a tablet.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I could be definitely convinced that there is one for that, but that's not the message that they're making.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   The message they're making is you don't want to be like one of those iPhone.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Right.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Those hip people you see on movies and television shows. You want to be a Samsung dude.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Whoo.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Initially.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yeah, there's nobody really says I want to be a Samsung fan.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But initially, I thought this might be so insulting. See that? They have a whole page and there's a whole series of ads.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I thought this initially and by the way, I'm getting a T-shirt and I was I shouldn't say it, but I'm getting a T-shirt that says, dude, you're a barista.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But which is all from an earlier one.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But at first, I thought, oh, Apple fanboys will be upset.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But I think what it really says is that the iPhone now is so mainstream that even iPhone users and people who love the iPhone can laugh at the fanboys because they're kind of marginalized now because everybody has an iPhone.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, or at least that's what it's not like it's targeted against us.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Right. I mean, it would be stupid to say we're targeting.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We want to make fun of the people who are our potential customers, right?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Right.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   That would be done.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I think they're.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I think it's a smart campaign. I think it's way better than the droid campaign that's going on.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Which I hate, then. The monsters and the robots and the movies.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah. Yeah. We make our phones out of the dead bodies of robots that were killed by other robots.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That doesn't seem like a good.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And it's the droid max with two X's because two X's is better than one.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Yeah. Samsung's got, I mean, it's funny.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And what is more set-hirable, I guess, than people waiting in line overnight to buy a phone.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I don't think all iPhone users are not people who wait in line overnight.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Although I did.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   But that's the way we were.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   A six hours for the first one.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But I think that that's the point is that we're a thin shell now and that the vast majority of iPhone users
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   is normal. People who might consider a ginormous phone.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Like, you know what? I did. I actually paid my own money for this and I love it.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But so here's another question.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Uh-huh. If you compare this to an iPhone, you put it next to an iPhone and you see this.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It looks like a tiny...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   On a recheck.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Here's the question. Is Apple going to eventually either get a bigger screen or be hobbled by the fact
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   that they're three and a half inches in a world of five and a half inch screens?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Right. You know, do we really know what the right sizes for these devices are going to be?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Apple obviously thinks that the three and a half and the ten are the right extremes here.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But there's room for experimentation and these guys are doing it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Other companies are doing it and we'll see.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I mean, I've got a kindle fire at home. That's a seven inch.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It seems really weird. Like, it's not too... It's not big enough and it's not small enough.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Right.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And this is on the other end of that. It's kind of interesting.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I, you know, I think... It wouldn't surprise me if Apple has some different sizes at some point down the road.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You know, like an iPod touch that's bigger.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Sort of like the Galaxy Note. But I don't know. I mean...
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I...
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   We'll just have to see. It adds some complication because of fragmentation.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Right.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   The sizes are many and varied in Apple's platform.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Okay, Andy. Sorry. I interrupted you.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I'm sorry. No, I was... I was... Miss Selecting Jumping On Points and certainly when you talk.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   But it really is fragmentation, but it's also probably one of the best advantages that Android has over iOS.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That no matter what kind of phone you want, you can find it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So if you want something with a larger screen because you spend less time doing this and more time reading
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and playing games and stuff like that, that's a cool feature.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So I'm not sure that Apple would want to do that only because this is the only phone that they're going to make
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   pretty much.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Also, they're kind of limited to what their developers can support.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And I think that they... Inside... Inside Apple, I think that they see that the ability to get your entire thumb
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   across the entire screen and use the iPhone one-handed is a user feature that they don't want to abandon.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I get a whole bunch of different... I pretty much every Android phone that's made for at least a couple of weeks.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And it really is kind of clumsy when you... The difference between a four and a quarter inch screen
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and even a four and a half inch screen is the difference between being able to just take something on my pocket,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   check Twitter, then put it back to sleep and put it in my pocket, and taking it out, having to take this other thing
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   off and put my bag on my shoulder and having to tap to get to the entire acreage of the screen.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So that's why it's good that there's this flexibility, but I'm sure that if you had to put most of your stock in one screen size,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Apple would probably rather put it into something that's more portable.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah, I mean, one man's fragmentation is another man's choice.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   So, I mean, that's just two sides of the same coin.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And I freely admit that the reason I like a ginormous phone is because I'm old.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And it's easier for me to read the Taffy and Print, and it's a lot easier for me to type.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So that, you know, just for me... Go ahead.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So it seems like if they really want to go for the elder market, they should be sizing the phone so it's the same size
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   as the reader's digest in the prevention magazine.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It is.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's exactly what this is.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's exactly what this is.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's like one of those, yeah, like the sci-fi magazines I read as a kid.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's a dot convenience digest size.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But now this is swipe, so it's not really the giant keyboard.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Well, I mean, to Andrew's point, to do I call him Android?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Android's point.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Little Android's point.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Young Android, and if I go here and show the keyboard...
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Apple wants to keep it simple.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   We all know your passcode now, Leo.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I'm sorry, I didn't have anything to hide.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Apple wants to keep it simple because they don't want to ship 80 different versions of their products.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   They want to focus it, and they've got a small size and a big size.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And I'm sure that if suddenly everybody wants a 7-inch tablet, Apple will say, well, maybe there's something there.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But I'm sure that Apple's tested every single size and decided that these are the two sizes that reach the most people.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   We know that because isn't that what they do in that lab?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   The secret lab that they wrote about where they have models of all different sizes, and Steve came in and he would heft and feel and everything like that.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Somebody wrote, I thought this was interesting, that that did give Apple a bias toward the physical.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   They were so successful at that, and this might be one explanation of why they keep stumbling a little bit with cloud and stuff like that.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   They're a hardware company, very much so, and that kind of was in their DNA, but also was kind of in the nature of the way that they looked.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   They had to hold a product to feel.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Who's going to knock the fact that we have a choice?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And you do have a choice, you just don't have a choice running iOS, but you still have a choice.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And according to Apple, this is a complete rip-off of iOS anyway, so you even have a choice that way too.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It's a word Apple, the fact that it uses a stylus means it's a complete failure.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Well, that's the next question.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Okay, so it does come with a pen, and one of the things, I thought it was great when Steve introduced the iPhone,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   he said, "Styleses suck, and we're not going to make something with a stylus."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   You have to use a stylus, you failed, I think, is what he said.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And of course, on the Galaxy Note, you don't have to use it.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   You don't have to.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So what it is, is it's an additional feature, which I don't think is such a bad feature.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   They have a bunch.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Well, and I'll tell you, there is a market for it.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   We know, because look at the size of the third-party market for pens on the iPhone and tablet.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   One of the most popular stories on Mackerel.com, week in and week out.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   One of our editors, Serenity Caldwell, has reviewed every single iPad stylus.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And that's a wildly popular.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   People do like styluses for the iPad, especially artists, but some people like to take notes by hand.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And it's a successful market, so it's not unreasonable.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's quirky.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I have a friend who got his first iPhone last year upgrading from a flip phone that I don't even think I had a camera on it.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And he never uses it without a stylus because having a pen in his hand and tapping it up so much is the most powerful way to do it.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   This is one of the things they tell.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   This is a use case that seems to me very limited, but if you press the button on the stylus and tap the screen, it does a screen capture.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I said if you press the button and you tap the screen, maybe it doesn't do anything.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   There it is.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Oh, it does a screen capture.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Oh, double tap makes a note.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Okay.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Welcome to Galaxy Note Weekly.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   No, you're right.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I probably shouldn't even talk about this because Apple people probably don't want to hear about it.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But I just think that this is telling.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I think it's fascinating because it's something we haven't really seen before.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And when you think of what Apple's choices have been, it's interesting to see the choices that Apple has made to not release products in certain categories and whether, you know, in the Galaxy Note is really interesting and different.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So that's my question.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Does the Galaxy Note make iPhone users interested?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Does it mean does it put pressure on the small screen of the iPhone and as it started out with, do the Samsung ads, do you find them insulting or successful or unsuccessful?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And so if you find the Samsung ads insulting, you've got problems in personal life.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   You need to create a lifestyle in which you have more actual victories in your life so that you don't feel quite so put upon by outside sources.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I don't think it's an effective ad because I was actually the Samsung Note was one of the more interesting things I was hoping to get my hands on as soon as it made its way to the US here.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Which it will look separate 19th on AT&T.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Right.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And hopefully I'll have one very shortly.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Really interesting form factor, but I don't think it really sold that version of it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It didn't really, excuse me, the commercial didn't bother to say, here's why you'd want to get out of this line and get into this line instead.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Right.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I should run my Newton.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It's about the size of it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And in the other room, it is almost Newton-esque, isn't it?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   It has handwriting recognition.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You know, Mark.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I think it's all good.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It means there's competition.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And I just wonder if Apple will respond to stuff like that or just stay the course.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And my suspicion is they'll stay the course.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   They don't respond to that.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   My only guess would be that if Apple feels like there's a room for another screen size, then they'll do it.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It probably won't be because of the competition, but it's possible.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I mean, the thing I keep thinking is, you know, not that there's going to be a smaller iPad, but what if there's a bigger iPod touch at some point?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Something that's just a little bit room here.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   But I don't know, Apple's doing pretty well with the products they've got, so they may be happy to keep it simple.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Well, of course, I keep waiting.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think this is the month that we expect to hear about a new iPad because if they're going to release.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Maybe next month.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They're going to release it.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   In March is when they always, but will they?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Well, beginning of April, they broke that rule with the iPhone.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   It could break the rule.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I mean, there's no, it's not an unwritten rule.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But I guess that it seems likely that if they do release a more expensive or a higher res, maybe won't be more expensive, but they will offer a lower cost version of the iPad 2 still.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   You think that will happen?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I think that would be great.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I think that we've seen the model right with the iPhone.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Yeah, I really think that's how they're going to respond to all these really good seven inch tablets that are coming out, not by producing a seven inch tablet of their own, but by making it that much more difficult for someone to say, well, geez, why are you going to spend $500 on an iPad?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   When all the core features you really want are available on this $250 tablet, well, it becomes a different thing when it's a $399 iPad or even a $350 iPad.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Good game, though.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Super Bowl.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Good game.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Okay.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Well, I enjoyed it.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I'm not a Giants fan.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Tom Brady gets to leave with a supermodel at the end.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   So, you know, boo-hoo for him.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Well, he's who's the American to Giselle.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Just Elbunch and yeah.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Poor guy.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Poor guy.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Loser.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Super Bowl Loser.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   As I said, when I started to look kind of hopeless for the Patriots, at least our quarterback will still be much, much more handsome than a Giants fan.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   They're both good looking fellas now.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Come on.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   They're both good looking.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   One now has a Super Bowl ring along with the fame and the money.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   So, there's an analyst.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   The pitchers and catches report in a week and a half.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   I know.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Is that exciting?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   At least like non-sports out of the way.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I just love that.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I just love that.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Those who buy Apple products says an analyst.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Keep analysts.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   They're always right.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   They always right.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Keep buying them and show few signs of stopping.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   This guy gets big bucks for this stuff.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   His name is Tony Sakonagi of Bernstein Research.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is a good article.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   This is a good insight.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   He's trying to calculate up over the lifetime of...
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Loyalty.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   ...of somebody who's going to buy Apple products, buy an iPhone every couple years.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   How much?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And then I pad a new Mac every three years.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   How much money you end up spending in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Which, you know, I think it's a really good point.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That it's an ongoing money source for Apple.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Total lifetime customer value.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   $204 billion in revenue for Apple by the end of fiscal 2012.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   $373 by the end of fiscal 2014.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Add the cash balance.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I need a cash register, Sand.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Ching, ching, ching, ching.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   2014, $548 billion.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And that is, they say, conservative.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Of course, the analysts do all this because they're...
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Is that a boat whistle?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Wow.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   A fog is rolling in.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   That's not even close.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   That sounds like...
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Jason had some bad for breakfast.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   So...
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   But the point is actually a very good point.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And it is the kind of calculation, for instance, phone companies and cable companies make.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Which is how much is a customer worth to us over the lifetime of the customer?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And how much does churn cost us?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And churn is a big issue if you're a cable company.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   A churn is a customer who becomes a customer.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Usually at great expense because they have to pay for advertising and marketing.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Get this guy in the door or gallon the door.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   How much does it cost you when you lose?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   How much of your customers leave after a year, two years, three years?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And the churn is a big deal in almost every market.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Apparently, not in Apple's market.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   This is why lock-in exists and why it benefits customers.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Or benefits companies to lock-in customers.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So, you know, when I was...
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Customer acquisition is costly.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It's same for Macworld Magazine.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It costs you a certain amount of money to get a subscriber.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And you've got to prorate that over how long they're probably likely to stay as a customer.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And so with this, it's so true Apple's ecosystem.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I feel like, you know, iTunes, music doesn't have DRM anymore.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   You're not really locked in.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   You can buy Amazon MP3s.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But the app thing is enormous.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That so many people bought iPhone apps and then they bought iPad apps.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And even if you would start to think about buying that Galaxy Note, one of the moments
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   that has to make you pause is the realization that you have to rebuy all of your favorite
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   apps because it's a different platform.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   And that's, you know, Apple's got to go for it with that kind of app lock-in.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   I believe I have a sound if you'll turn me up.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Thanks to our chat room.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Turned up.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Massa Media.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Oh.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   That's not big enough.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I need a huge $548 billion could change.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Keep talking and I'll give you something in just a second.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   It should have money cascading from a ceiling.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   It should have balloons.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It should have...
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's like a telephone.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It's like a telephone.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I lean's working on it.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Hold on.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Okay.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   It's not the app.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Somebody's...
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Mac texting in the chat room phone apps are not that expensive, but that's not the point.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, no, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I mean, if the right device came along that fit into the way that I work better, there
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   are not a whole lot of apps on my iPad right now where it would really be painful for me
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   to buy or to replace them with something else.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Most of the apps on the thing are five bucks, ten bucks.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   The expensive one I think is actually 30 bucks.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   That's just the sling player app.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   So if it costs less than, let's say, 50 or 60 bucks to replace the core apps that I really,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   really want, not the...
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Oh, the lifetime of the product, all the stupid and dollar, $99 games and 99 cent things that
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I just bought just to sort of mess around with them for a little while.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I don't think that that would be a hindrance.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   But it really comes down to Apple has me locked in because they keep having the best software
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   or the best hardware or more to the point, the stuff that works together and it enhances
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   the way that I do go about my personal life, my business life every day.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I'm less likely.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Oh, here we go.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I was just waiting for a pause.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I leave her there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It's the message.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's basically about the economy that $40 science are now made of, was that like...
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yeah, in the computer?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yeah, it's the computer.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Yeah, it's like a computer science, not gold ones.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Wow.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   That's amazing.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   But there is...
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I mean, it's part of the lock-in.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It's all of it.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It's the hardware.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's the ease of use, the ecosystem.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And it's also the fact that you don't have...
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Because you don't have DRM anymore, you don't have the lock-in with songs.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   But because you spent maybe a few hundred dollars on apps, you're going to...
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   At least there's a little resistance to check it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Right, and if you bought movies with windows...
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   ...and it's the first time it's when you switch it, you switch it back.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It doesn't have to be a shackle.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   It just means the more inconvenient you make it, the more pause you give somebody.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And they think, "Well, if I buy this tablet, I'm going to have to buy those apps.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And if I want them on my phone too, I'm going to have to buy it separately."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Right.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And if I buy this iPad and an iPhone, they'd work on both.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And it may not be a lot of money, but it's part of that psychology, I think.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Here's the other thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So he figured out how much with the lifetime value per customer per product is based on retention
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   rates, replacement time, and margin.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And the number is interesting.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So the iPhone is worth...
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Because it's replaced every two years, seven to nine hundred dollars every two years.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   A Mac replaced every three years, about six to six hundred fifty dollars.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   An iPad replaced every three years, two hundred seventy-five to three hundred dollars.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   So the iPhone is by a factor of fifty to a hundred percent more valuable than any other
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   product Apple sells.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.200]   And that's partly because we don't see the price of the iPhone because it's subsidized by
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   the carriers.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   It's an invisible thing.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   It's in your phone bill every month.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   Right.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   But that's very...
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   I think that shows you...
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.000]   I boy am mocked Apple when they said, "Oh, we want to get in the phone business."
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I remember telling Scott Gordon, "There's no way Apple's going to get in the phone business."
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You know, a horrible business.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Like, why would they get in the TV business?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Horrible business.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And yet they've managed to make this the most successful, not only most successful phone
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   ever, but also a huge cash cow for the company more than even any other product.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   It's more than half their revenue.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And didn't somebody calculate that it's more than in the last quarter, there was more iPhone
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   revenue than there was Microsoft revenue.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Wow.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   That is kind of amazing, isn't it?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   That's a good question.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   It's kind of saying something, isn't it?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   So, kudos, props to Steve Jobs and whoever else said, "We got to do a phone," despite
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.800]   the fact that you just really don't want to get in this business with these carriers
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   who are nightmares.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.000]   Well, AT&T cracked, right?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   They did.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   They brought him to their knees.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And they still are broken as far as I'm concerned.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.800]   One of the reasons I got this unlocked note so I could run it on T-Mobile is AT&T's network
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   is terrible.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   You know, I was surprised.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   When we went to New York, I thought, "Well, it'll be better than a Bay Area."
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   No, it's just...
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.400]   3G on AT&T is horrible in New York.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.600]   Oh, New York specifically is such a sinkhole of non-con comedy.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   Is there anything better?
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.200]   Is Verizon better?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   No, New York is really just the torture chamber for getting cell coverage anywhere.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.520]   You're in the middle of a street level in the steep canyons.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.160]   It's so bad that I can tell you pretty much the exact Amtrak stop from Boston to New York
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.120]   where I know that I got to make sure that I download.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.200]   If I need a map to get somewhere, that's the stop by which I need to make sure that I'm
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   connected and I download these maps or new screen captures because I can't count on being
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:17.160]   on 33rd and 7th and still know how to get to a certain office from here if I'm trusting
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.240]   on Google Maps to get me there.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.680]   Well, it was a little bit of a revelation to me, I have to say.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   We all saw this picture of Steve Jobs as a youth.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.760]   I think Annie Hertzfeld posted this on Google+, flipping off, flipping the bird.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.920]   It's like the Super Bowl halftime show now.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.880]   To the big blue.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.680]   Well guess who IBM just knocked off the list of major brands?
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.320]   Apple knocked IBM off the list of major brands.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.120]   So Steve, you did it.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.600]   Maybe it took you 30, 40 years.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.640]   Apple is the top brand of 2011.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.080]   According to an annual list put together by Davis Brand Capital, IBM had come in first
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.280]   in 2009, 2010, Microsoft, Google and HP other tech companies on there.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:12.720]   But Apple, number one for 2011, Apple, then IBM, Microsoft, Google, HP, General Electric,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.440]   Procter & Gamble, Intel, Coke.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.160]   See, we've seen other studies that said Coke was bigger.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.640]   What kind of list is this where IBM last year was the top brand?
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   In what world are they living?
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   Who are these people?
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   What's wrong with them?
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.320]   Was this a poll taken at golf courses?
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.760]   And mixers and high society.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.200]   It evaluates companies' abilities to manage and balance the five key and tangible categories
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.840]   that comprise brand capital, brand value, competitive performance, innovation, strength,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.280]   company culture and social impact.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.640]   You see, if they put poison comportment on that list, I really think that Pepsi would
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   have been higher on that list.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.280]   Pepsi does great in these.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.520]   They have a very debut ton-tish sort of way about them.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.160]   Up yours IBM.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.120]   I just did excuse for me to show that picture again.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.960]   I just love that picture of Jobs flipping the blade to big blue.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   What do you think the value is of that sort of thing?
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   I've doing that.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.960]   I mean, no, no, I mean, I mean...
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   Cotharsus Andy.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   It's catharsus.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:24.520]   Oh, no, I've had a Chicago and I've had pictures of myself taking near the tribute building
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.240]   that I probably don't want Andy Hertz to get a hold of.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.000]   I mean, whenever it seems like, but this actual ranking, it seems like more of a metric that's
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   of value to the sort of people who would be offended by that Samsung ad, but not really
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.760]   of value to, especially a company like Apple that doesn't really care how they're perceived,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.440]   they only care about how people vote with their dollars.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   Who cares?
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   Still, I love that.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.440]   He just looks so happy.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.320]   I was just scratching the side of my face.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   The fact that I was pointing at the tribute building while I was doing it, I was holding
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.920]   my iPhone, I was a finger, I was not giving it the tribute.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   On the center's pick.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   It wasn't a pick.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   It was a scratch.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   Amazon wants to get in the big store business.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   Now see, here's...
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.680]   Okay, as long as Leo's doing the Maya Cup, I said Apple should not get into the iPhone
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   business.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.920]   I said Apple should not get into the TV business.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.840]   We'll see if I was right or wrong about that.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.720]   And I very, very clearly said, and I was, by the way, the Apple board supported me at
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.840]   the time that Apple should not get into the retail business.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   Look what happened.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.880]   Gateway had just folded its stores shortly before that.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.960]   What a terrible idea.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.240]   Now of course it's widely held.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.480]   It's probably the smartest move of any American company in the last 100 years.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   But okay.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   Okay.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.880]   I didn't think they should get into it either.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.120]   I thought Intel was a mistake.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.720]   So obviously the Apple's not listening to me.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.400]   Or they're just doing the opposite.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.720]   Oh, maybe they are listening.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   You think it was?
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   You are their...
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   You are their...
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   Do the opposite.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   Oh, what a little answer.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   Well, it's the idea.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   All right.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.320]   Amazon is thinking about opening physical brick and mortar stores.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   Now, I consider the source of this story is Jason Calicanis.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:09.320]   But the New York Times, Bitts vlog, did citing the Calicanis stories speculate the same thing.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.560]   David Strightfeld writing for the Times said this has...
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.160]   Speculation has been around for quite some time.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.720]   Did the magic that made the Apple Store so successful?
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.280]   Can that brush off on a company like Amazon?
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   Apple's got hardware.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.040]   I mean, that's the big difference.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.280]   Is this going to be a Kindle store on its own?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.640]   Is it going to be a limited selection?
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.080]   I mean, Amazon's problem is they don't have storefronts to show kindles, although they
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.440]   now have kindles in target stores and places like that.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.240]   Which part is it that they're doing?
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   Right.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.560]   That was the advantage Barnes and Noble had is they could put the nook out front in their
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   brick and mortar stores.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.360]   Amazon is doing Amazon exclusive books now.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   Right.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   So they will have some books to sell.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   But yeah, I think it's...
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.240]   I gather it's e-readers and tablets.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   They want to launch a test store in Seattle according to rumors by the end of the year.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.720]   Why not try it?
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.560]   Well, there's a good reason for tax reasons.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.720]   So you don't want to have a physical presence.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.280]   I'm starting to wonder, I mean, first off, they've got a presence in Washington.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   So they can test it there.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.080]   But if you look at what Amazon's been doing, like their settlement with the state of California,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.040]   I feel like Amazon may be realizing that the jig is in terms of paying state taxes.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   They're going to have to do it.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.200]   So the settlement with California said that they will eventually like 2014, they'll
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.800]   pay California's taxes unless the federal government does an internet tax.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.080]   That's flat in which case they'll do that instead.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.520]   But they basically agreed they will pay tax of some sort.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   Well, that would be a good topic for companies.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.040]   I really think that they've got a James Bond style threat room where they're figuring
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.080]   out that they're prevented from doing things like having more depot was a more operation
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.440]   centers in certain states because the more physical presence that they have, even if
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.040]   it's not a retail establishment, the greater their exposure is to having to pay state sales
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   taxes.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.560]   So my guess is that they already know which states where they're saying that, look, I
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.960]   know that we'll have a certain drop off if we have to start a collect state sales tax
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   here.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.720]   It actually expedite our deliveries by not having to route it through East Yahoo in order
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.560]   to deliver to our customers in the state.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.840]   And then they would say, if we're going to basically say that we're resigned to the fact
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.360]   of having a presence that's large enough to demand states sales tax, let's at least see
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.600]   what we can do about finding some good high profile space in one of these high up scale
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.720]   malls where there's at least three storefronts that have been closed out for the past six
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.120]   or eight months, put some devices there and see if we get attraction.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:41.000]   I don't see anything like the Apple store, but it might be okay to do something like
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.200]   the Mont Blanc store where you were in these malls.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:50.360]   You're wondering why is there an entire store devoted to pens and men's fragrances, but
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   it's small.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   It needs to be only staffed by two people.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   It's an ad.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.480]   It gives people sort of exact, not only that, but it's also an ad that they specifically
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   control.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.800]   It's a space where they control the vertical and the horizontal.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.280]   So I don't, I've nothing like the Apple store, but I wouldn't be surprised if they decided
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.920]   as part of a longer range strategy, it's okay for us to open up 10 stores in this state
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   and see what happens.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.760]   Apple has apparently been talking about, remember they used to do this before their
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.240]   Apple stores in Comp USA, they used to have Apple little mini stores.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   Yeah, the store within a store.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.960]   They want to do that again, apparently in big box stores they're talking to, I think,
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.880]   Costco about doing that.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.080]   I think stick with the store you control or so many computers sold in the big box stores
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.480]   that they have to.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.680]   They took the iPads out.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   Right.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.080]   Well, they didn't want to sell them.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.560]   They didn't want to give them to Costco so they could sell them cheaper.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.560]   Right.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   They didn't want to cost cutting.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   That is interesting.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.080]   Costco was, I think, the one store that they Apple actually did a clearance deal with,
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   wasn't it?
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   Oh.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.360]   Years ago when they had a hold, when they decided that the early power books were a
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   bad idea, I think Costco was the only big box store where you're able to actually swoop
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.680]   down and get like an early power book for next to nothing.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.200]   So not that that would have been like what 15, 20 years ago, so it's not quite operative,
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.120]   but it's interesting that they'd be going down to Costco.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.560]   I think the other thing is that Costco of all the big box stores is the one that usually
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.800]   scores high on the list for customer service and how well they treat their employees.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.600]   So they've got a lot of, they promote a lot from within their own ranks.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.440]   They have a long retention rate for their employees.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.520]   So if you're going to choose a big box store, you don't want disgruntled teens who wonder
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.560]   why they're accepting 75 cents an hour above minimum wage.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.600]   That's somebody saying it's Sam's Club, not Costco.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Okay.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.640]   There are parts of the country where Apple stores can't reach and even though the Apple
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.160]   store is incredibly successful, there are limits and I'm sure they do the calculations
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.720]   and figure there's some areas that they can't serve.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.840]   And if they do Sam's Club, I can Walmart before behind the same company, right?
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.280]   And then they are doing, they already do Best Buy, right?
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   And they're going to do Target, they announced last couple of weeks ago.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.880]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.720]   It's places that they don't want an open Apple store but they want to have a presence.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   Right.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:10.040]   And they have shown that people seeing their products in person has a lot of power.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.760]   And that would be to go back to Amazon.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.600]   That would be the real reason to have that mall store is to say, here's what the Kindle
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.280]   is like and look how awesome it is and dojo want one for all those people who've never
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.040]   seen any reader before and don't get it.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.440]   Well, and that's why Apple did the stores, right?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.920]   They wanted to control how their product was presented.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.120]   And I'm sure Amazon feels the same way.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:35.440]   Yeah, not only that, but it's hard to remember exactly how badly Apple products were presented
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.520]   in retail stores, like in places like Sears and other stores like that before they had
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.600]   their own stores.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.120]   It was traditional that you walked into the store and every Apple screen would be black,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   dark.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.920]   And the real things that were up and running were the Windows machines, not because the
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   Windows machines were more reliable, God no, but because the employees just, they didn't
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.840]   use Macs that didn't care about Macs and it was easier for them to upsell Windows machines.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.800]   They're getting a better spiff on for each sale than Macs.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.720]   There's a kind of a problem like that with Walmart too, because they already have iPads
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.440]   and other devices.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.600]   They have them in these sealed in, like sort of chromatically sealed Michael Jackson,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Hyperbaric boxes.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.200]   But even so, it seems as though Euro is likely as not as to walk past there and see black
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.000]   screens instead of seeing active, nice, come and touch and fondle this device demos.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Right.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.560]   A lot of these store within a store is I believe there are Apple employees manning them, so
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.400]   it's not even the store employees.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   They're just using the store space.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   They did that.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   I was saying that was what they did.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   That's what they did.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   I think I think it was a little bit of a zone.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.560]   Yeah, it was fun because I'd run into people that copy and say, "Who works for Apple?"
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   This is their beat.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.660]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Jason Snell Editor in Chief of Mac
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.800]   World Magazine is here.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.040]   Anything you want to plug or anything?
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.120]   Are you going to do it anymore Mac World Cruises?
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   Is that over?
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.760]   Yeah, no, we're going to Australia this.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   You're going to be falling.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   Are you going?
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.760]   Yeah, we're going.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   Mac Manning of 15.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   How about Mac Manning?
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   I'm going.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.160]   I'm going to be funny for our fans down under.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   Within Eclipse.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.040]   Yeah, you won't have to fly anywhere.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.920]   We're leaving from Sydney on November 7th, 2012.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.000]   We're going to Brisbane.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I'll do meetups.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   We'll do, you should join me.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.920]   We'll do meetups in Brisbane and Sydney.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.520]   And then we're going to go to New Caledonia.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   We're going to go to the Great Barrier Reef.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.440]   Yeah, in the middle of the ocean, the sun is going to go out.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.480]   That's really nice of Captain Neil to arrange that.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.880]   We hope that it comes back.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.400]   I think he usually brings people from Scientific American for these things.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.360]   So I wonder if this is a joint with Scientific American.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.760]   It's possible because they do the clips for them too.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.240]   They do the clips cruises.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.600]   Anyway, if you want to do it, we'd love to have you.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   Insightcruises.com.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   Free plug.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   Nice.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   He's going to be there.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   Sorry, Andy, just don't cover your ears.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   Don't listen.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   That's OK.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.840]   I'd be freaked out by the toilet flushing down there.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   I know.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   It goes the other way.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.720]   Actually, we're going to investigate.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   We should have--
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   It doesn't.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   It's not true.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   Sorry.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   We're going to have an investigation.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   We have a--
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   Spoiler alert.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Spoiler.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   All right, we'll test it out.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   Scientific American.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   It'd be like Al Capone Safe.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   I'll do a whole thing.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.240]   Next week on a very special twit, does the toilet go the other way?
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.800]   Find out the truth.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.280]   We're going to investigate a reporter.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.440]   People will really want to tune in for the toilet.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   That'll be it.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   Maybe not.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.440]   Well, as we get toilets, it's coming.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.760]   The fact that we have 30% of our audience is in Australia kind of eliminates the value
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.000]   of that research.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   They already know.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Those meetups are going to be--
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Actually, they don't know.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   You know why they don't know?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Because they've never seen it go the other way.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.840]   They don't know what the other way is.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.240]   The moon's upside down there, too.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   Did you know that?
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.320]   OK, but what direction does a rat hole spin?
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   I don't know.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.520]   Look around you, because we're in it.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.680]   The show, and Andy and I go also here from the Chicago Sun Times, which is-- is that
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.680]   owned by the Tribune Corp?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   Just out of curiosity?
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   No.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   No, ex-Mayor, in fact, we have new and very, very lively owners who are reviling.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.560]   And the Sun Times has always been doing pretty well.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.080]   But now we've got new owners who are local businessmen.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.320]   And so we're finally under the thumb of the guy who basically bought the magazine, bought
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.520]   the newspaper 20 years ago just to say, ooh, how much can we get for that desk chair?
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   Oh.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.880]   You know, you're surrounded by people whose words go on dead trees.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.120]   No, you know what?
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   No, I don't mind.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   Especially--
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.520]   It's the two of us who are single-handedly keeping the soy business afloat.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   If you're a soy farmer--
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.520]   You have the ink.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.520]   --thank you.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   In Canada, we apologize for taking your trees.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   All the hardwood, all the old growth forests.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   Leveled.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.160]   You think about the light, not the light, that's how you're getting from the--
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.680]   You never used to see a sunset before in the middle of the forest.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.360]   Now you see all the way to the horizon.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.200]   Let every flower grow.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   Yes.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.600]   No, I read a newspaper the other day and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.600]   It was great.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.360]   You know, I hate to say this, but yes, this morning I was doing all my reading on my iPad.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.800]   I was at the library and it was really, wow, what a wonderful experience it is to hold
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.000]   a magazine, like a physical predator.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.280]   It's all together and the pictures of the thing that's lovely.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   They should--
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.280]   Oh wait.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   I grew up with magazines and comic books.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Oops.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   Oops.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   Why is it so weird now?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   It does.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   It feels archaic.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.520]   You turn it and there's something new.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   Mm.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.280]   So we're going to talk a little bit about--
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   No, it will always--
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   Don't worry, Jason.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.480]   It will always be a place for a Mackerel magazine.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.480]   Always.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.640]   And it will be on the iPad, probably, but that's OK.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   That's not so bad.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   I'm fine with that.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   You could do worse.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   You're kind of a natural for the iPad, actually.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.280]   Galaxy Note's a little small there.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   Oh.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.400]   Actually, I do read Mackerel magazine on the couch.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   No, is that weird?
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   Is that weird?
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   Yes.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Because it's just--
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   It's really weird.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   You know, there's 1280 by 800.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.840]   This is like-- this is the same resolution as my air.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.600]   Anyway, moving right along, ladies and gentlemen, I would like--
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   actually, it's not.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.320]   My air is a little bit different.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.880]   It's 1366 by 768.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.440]   So it's a little wider and a little shorter.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.920]   Pixel wise.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.640]   This show brought to you by Go To My PC.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.120]   See, not the right name for this crowd, even though it works.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.840]   It should be called Go To My Mac.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.000]   Because it works just as well on the Mac.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.160]   What's cool about it is you can go to your Mac from a PC
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.200]   and go to your PC from Mac.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.800]   You can go to your Mac from an iPad.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.600]   You can go to your Mac from an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.840]   You can access your office computer from anywhere
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.800]   you can get online.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.880]   It is so cool.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.320]   They're new iPhone app.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.240]   Awesomeness.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.840]   So here's a-- sometimes a case study, a scenario.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.000]   If you will, you're driving.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.840]   You're going to the airport.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.960]   And you only-- tight.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.520]   You're driving the traffic span.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.400]   You know, you're just going to make the plane.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.040]   And then you go, this happens to me all the time.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.720]   I forgot the PowerPoint.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.400]   I forgot the keynote.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.320]   I forgot that document that I forgot the presentation.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:49.760]   What do you do?
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.560]   You turn around, go back to the office?
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.360]   No, you're going to miss the plane.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.120]   You call somebody at the office and say, can you try that?
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   OK, it's on my computer.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.440]   Yeah, I'll give you the password.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.520]   No, what you do-- this is great.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.240]   You get to the airport.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.600]   You log in with your iPhone.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.280]   Give me your computer.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:04.600]   It works.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.240]   Can you go, OK.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.840]   You download it.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.520]   And then it's done.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.680]   You can access your office computer anytime.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.480]   It's like having it right in your pocket.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.360]   Take care of last minute requests from anywhere.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.040]   Edit your keynotes or your PowerPoint.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.120]   Update your spreadsheets.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.920]   You can work on any file.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.280]   You can send and receive email.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.160]   It's just like your work, except you're not
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.880]   you're accessing your office computer from anywhere.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.560]   Go to my PC.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.120]   They've got it for the iPad, the iPhone.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.600]   They actually have it for Android phones.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.840]   And of course, of all your desktops as well.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.720]   Sets up in minutes.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.000]   No IT help is necessary.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.680]   In fact, we're going to do a demonstration
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.080]   right now with your help.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Go to the website.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.960]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.400]   Click that Try It free button.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.680]   And enter in the code MAC BREAK 30 days free.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.920]   Unlimited use free.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.280]   So you'll see how quickly it sets up.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.120]   And then download the iPad or the iPhone app and try it.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.040]   You are going to love it.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.560]   It's fast.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.040]   It's easy.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.000]   It's effective.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.360]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.880]   Use the offer code MAC BREAK.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.960]   Secure, by the way.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.040]   Never been in the next point.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.760]   Fast.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.800]   There's nothing faster.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.840]   It's just the best from Citrix.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.480]   Go to my PC.com offer code MAC BREAK.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.240]   Do you like Ferris Bueller, the Ferris Bueller,
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   and knock off they did for the Honda?
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.640]   That was good.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.880]   His slow transformation into Don Knott's continuous.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.040]   Yes.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.800]   You're talking about Matthew Broderick.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   Matthew Broderick, yes.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   That's the--
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.560]   I just don't know.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.200]   Just in Apple stock at a new all time high,
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.680]   I'm not surprised after that amazing report, the quarterly
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.160]   report last week.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.760]   They're up $5 today.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.600]   Was there an announcement?
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.680]   No.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.360]   They're up $5 today to $4.69.29.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.960]   That is the highest they have been ever, ever, ever, ever.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.600]   Doomed.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.120]   Doomed.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.760]   Doomed, beleaguered.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   It's over?
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.360]   Doomed, oh, it's over for Apple.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.160]   Well, I'm just over it.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.040]   OK, they keep telling me, and the stock is going up.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040]   It's over?
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:10.680]   Just, yeah.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.120]   Oh, no.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.080]   This is--
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.120]   What they say is they're like, well, it's so high now.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.280]   How could it get anywhere for it to go, but down?
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.240]   Actually, there is one other place it could go.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:19.720]   Up.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.320]   Up.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.280]   Look at this.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.080]   This is over a year.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.160]   Climbing, climbing, climbing.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.080]   Wow.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   And I don't own tech stocks, and I know you don't either, Jason.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.520]   Not allowed.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.200]   We're not allowed to.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.760]   Just-- I'm the boss.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.040]   I'm allowed to, I guess.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.360]   But I just ethics preclude the idea
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.000]   that I might have an investment in any company we cover.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   But damn.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Damn.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.920]   Profits, you know, this is for all the talk of market share,
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.200]   and I know this gets beaten up a lot.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.280]   But all the talk of market share,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.120]   in the phone industry, especially, the profit share--
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.640]   there was a story today about the iPhone taking last quarter,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.800]   some ridiculous percentage of the profits.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.360]   Maybe that's it.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.080]   So we already knew, but we already knew.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.640]   It's just that shows you.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.720]   It's amazing.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.000]   And there's bad news today.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.160]   Like China might be finding Apple and banning the iPad,
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.600]   because China says Apple views the trademark.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.640]   Now that's just bizarre.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.400]   So now China decides to enforce trademark law.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.080]   Well, it had to happen.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   Apple seems to have a really good relationship with China,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.120]   with the Chinese government, and has been successful in China.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.800]   So I would imagine-- and of course, produces all of its stuff
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.300]   there.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.520]   So I would imagine it'll all work out.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.680]   So apparently in 2006, Apple-- kind of sneaky,
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.360]   because 2006, nobody thought they were going to make an iPad--
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.720]   via a subsidiary called the IP Application Development
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.440]   Corporation purchased the name in China for iPad.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.960]   I guess it's iPad from--
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.080]   I don't know.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.280]   Is that what it is in China?
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.680]   I don't know.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   They purchased whatever the name iPad is in China.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.040]   I think it's iPad.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.200]   From a company apparently, ProView International Holdings
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.120]   in Hong Kong owned it.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.600]   The Chinese market rights to use the trademark.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.440]   They only paid them $55,000.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.840]   So did-- I mean, this is what happens
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.880]   when you're buying a domain, is you don't want to go in.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.200]   You don't tell them.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.360]   And saying, hey, I'm a rich money bag.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.800]   I need your domain.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   And so instead, did they actually come up with a fake company
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   with the initials I-P-A-D just divided--
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.920]   I-pad.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.520]   Wow.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.160]   You caught it.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.200]   I didn't even catch that.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   IP application development.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   It's totally legit.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.040]   We just want the day because that's our initials.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.640]   We don't have any attention of making
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.600]   a world-beating tablet device of reinventing computing
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.880]   and creating a post-PC era.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.480]   Not us!
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.640]   Wow.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.400]   Our founder, Mr. IP, told us.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.880]   Now, to me, you snooze, you lose, right?
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.280]   But they sued.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.560]   They sued Apple, and they said, we'll settle out of court.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.520]   Just give us a little more, 55k.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.920]   Come on, dudes.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.560]   So they went to Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.360]   over the trade--
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.480]   So the Faulkner is still there, I think.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.400]   Where's my gavel?
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.720]   This doesn't sound like a joke.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.840]   Over the trade marks, IPad and IPad--
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.640]   they seem the same to me, but apparently.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.400]   They're pronounced differently.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.080]   Well, though, the eye is capitalized in one
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.080]   and lower-case in the other.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.520]   All right.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:30.120]   They wanted $10 billion yuan, which is $1.5 billion US dollars.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   You're already in trouble because--
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   $1.5 billion.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.000]   --you're going up against--
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.840]   they're already going up against a company that
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.760]   has $100 billion in cash.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Right.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.320]   In fact, you're also dealing with a government that
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.720]   is-- really does whatever the hell it wants.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.560]   And then you're trying to sue a company that's
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.320]   responsible for a great deal of Chinese income.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.520]   I'm--
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.680]   That's--
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.960]   Well, perhaps we'll get a couple of t-shirts out of the deal.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.600]   They say we sold it to IPad, not Apple.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.200]   Apple said ProView was in the wrong,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.440]   and it owns the trade mark via a transfer.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.920]   Right.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.520]   And in fact, Apple's countersued, saying
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.560]   we want $645,000 or $634,000 in legal fees.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.640]   The court is apparently, according to DailyTech.com,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:29.880]   on the verge of ordering a $38 million fine to Apple.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.000]   That's better than $1.5 billion.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.440]   And apparently, this isn't the end of it.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.120]   They're now filing lawsuits against--
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.680]   ProView's filing lawsuits against retail partners
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.360]   who sell the IPad.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.600]   All those counterfeit Apple stores are going to be sued now.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.880]   They also want a licensing--
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.180]   Why?
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.640]   You know, it's so funny.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.360]   China completely ignores intellectual property.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:52.880]   Completely.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.240]   Trade Mark Lock-up means nothing.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.880]   You go to Beijing in the basement of a major shopping mall.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.080]   Every movie ever made.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.200]   You can buy a beautiful, nicely made DVDs.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   Completely illegal.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.400]   But now, oh, now they care.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.440]   I love that they got taken by this IPad company.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.520]   And now they're like, well, we can sue, right?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.240]   Well, I guess.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.360]   But they lost.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   They played the game and they lost.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.040]   It's very clever, though.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:22.640]   I love that.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.840]   Welcome to capitalism, my friends.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.400]   Welcome.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.920]   You snooze, you lose.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.560]   Finders, keepers, losers, weepers.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   See, that's the problem.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.480]   In China, they don't have that phrase.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.800]   Finders, keepers, losers, weepers.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.440]   Otherwise, you just--
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.240]   They're not allowed to sleep.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.560]   They're supposed to work.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.400]   You could say that.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.520]   And it would win automatically in court.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.240]   Are you all head up about AT&T suddenly deciding
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.800]   that even though I have and you have,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.480]   and I'm sure we all have, grandfather
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.520]   in unlimited data plans that you're
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.280]   a bandwidth hog if you go over to gigabytes.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.480]   Are you getting email yet from readers about this?
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.360]   Yes, I've gotten emails from readers about this.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.440]   So have we.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.960]   You're on the unlimited grandfathered in plan.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.760]   And if you're in the top 5% of users,
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.880]   they say they're going to--
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   Probably you.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.840]   Which sounds like you're being choked to death,
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.160]   but actually just means your bandwidth is being choked.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.720]   Well, depends on how much internet you use.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.760]   They may send a guy to your house.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.600]   Or since it's stopping, cutting out.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.720]   It's throwing you.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.920]   But otherwise, yeah.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.000]   They want to kick everybody off already.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.680]   If you want to do tethering or anything like that,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.160]   you've got to change to a modern plan.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.520]   They want to get people off this unlimited plan
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.200]   because they figure that it's killing them.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.120]   But they did promise to have an unlimited plan.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.600]   And for most people, this is the only reason they didn't buy--
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.720]   no, I don't know.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.440]   I'll speak for myself.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.200]   It's the only reason I didn't buy Verizon iPhone.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.520]   Is that your grandfather on the mountain?
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.200]   I'm a grandfather on AT&T.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.880]   I want to keep it.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.440]   Because AT&T's bandwidth is terrible here in San Francisco
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.880]   and it's New York.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.400]   But at least--
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.240]   OK, so here's the thing.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:54.480]   If the next iPhone is an LTE phone--
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.640]   well, I guess it could be on AT&T.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.320]   But if you could get an L4G on Verizon, it's so good.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   Wouldn't they just lose customers in droves?
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:03.640]   AT&T?
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.160]   Maybe not.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:04.800]   I don't know.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.120]   Maybe not.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.960]   Depends on how quickly AT&T can roll out their 4G,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.760]   their real 4G, their LTE, 4G.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.280]   And get off this throttling thing.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.640]   So have anybody in the chatroom?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.440]   We have a fairly large chatroom.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.960]   Are some of you--
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.440]   have some of you receive those notes?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.800]   I know I've received emails.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.240]   You got it?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:25.880]   Eileen got one.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.840]   I'm still an AT&T user.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.440]   I was grandfathered in, but I've been using my SIM card
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.880]   in my Galaxy S2.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.400]   But I still--
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.920]   Oh, you're not even using it on iPhone.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.480]   I still got the text messages.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   I got one about three weeks ago.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.480]   And then I got one this week.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.040]   So Magellan Tech said received the letter last month.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.200]   Web98916 and 6915 both have friends or have received it.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:58.040]   I guess they're protecting their network, right?
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.080]   Is that the justification?
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.560]   It's unlimited, but don't use too much.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.120]   Thank you, Mummy.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.320]   Unlimited is a hell of a thing.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.480]   I mean, that is literally telling people
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.280]   that if you want to stream Netflix eight hours a day
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.200]   at work, why bother turning it off?
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   It's free.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.560]   It doesn't cost you any more money.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.520]   And that-- it's not so much a problem
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.840]   for the entire network is a problem for specific nodes
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   in the network.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:29.440]   And I do think that AT&T has been generous with unlimited users
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.080]   so long as they're not really hysterically abusive up
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.200]   to this point, because I, myself, and a lot of the people
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   I've talked to have had problems where, for one reason
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.000]   or another, they-- for instance, on the iPad,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.400]   we've been grandfathered in for unlimited data.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.000]   And for, like, we got a new credit card
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.920]   and forgot to update this one account.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.040]   It lapsed.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.080]   And we got unlimited data turned off.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.000]   Well, if you call AT&T, explain what happened,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.320]   then we'll say, well, we can't do this more than once,
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.920]   but this one time we will put you back
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.320]   on the unlimited data plan.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.440]   But thank you for using AT&T.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.840]   So I really think that this is a network load problem,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.880]   but they could definitely handle this last night.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.920]   It's not their first choice to do this, in other words,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.160]   but they have to.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.560]   I don't think so.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.760]   This is another case where I really
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.280]   think the transparency would be--
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:16.760]   Yes.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.320]   --go a long, long way to getting people live.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.280]   If all they have to do is simply say that, yes,
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.440]   I know that if you're in the middle of Delaware,
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.520]   this is not an issue.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.800]   But here are some numbers that we've
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.000]   got for certain incidents in which people just simply could
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.480]   not get the bandwidth they're supposed to get,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.640]   because there are four people out of 10,000 users accessing
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.080]   this node that were just keeping this on 24/7.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   Oh, god, I'm a four.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.920]   So on and on a glowing thing, we need to sort of at least
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.680]   have an issue for this.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.000]   I wonder how many unlimited customers are left.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.480]   And I really wonder how much--
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.040]   it may be that the ones who are left
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.800]   are the ones who are most likely to use all that time.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.360]   Of course they are.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.280]   So that's the issue.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.240]   Of course they are.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.720]   It really is like a problem where you've got--
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.840]   we've got too many 78-year-old people
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   who are hogging the best seats at the Dunkin Donuts.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840]   It's like, you know what?
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.320]   The younger people aren't doing this.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.520]   This is a problem that's going to solve itself, link, wink,
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.880]   if we simply are nice for another two or three years.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   I think that's the same reason why Jerry Lewis was allowed
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.880]   to continue to host the telethon as many years as he did.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.360]   Because I think that the organization thought,
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.400]   we could either cause this big scene by firing him,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.600]   or we could let nature take its torus and fire him for us.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.480]   I can't think of-- I'm still using my iPad 1,
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.040]   chiefly because I didn't really see a need to upgrade the iPad 2.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.000]   But at some point, I'm going to be buying a new iPad.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.360]   I'm going to be probably in some sort of a circumstance
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.320]   in which I will have to make the decision between keeping
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.440]   old hardware and unlimited data or switching
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   to new hardware or a new carrier and being data-capped.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.200]   And it won't be much of a choice outside.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.760]   Well, I'm much rather have the new servers with the new hardware
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.720]   and get rid of it.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.800]   It's still a problem for me to try to decide whether or not
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.520]   I actually want to go for tethering on my iPhone for that reason.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.840]   That I still, on a month by month basis, think that, well,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.200]   I don't really need that.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.120]   I don't really need tethering in that many places.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   So I'd much rather have the extra half a gigabyte
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.560]   that I seem to need every single month.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.320]   But there's going to be a time in which I
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.360]   need to work in a space that has no Wi-Fi.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.400]   In which case, I'll say, OK, it was nice while it lasted.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.440]   Goodbye.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.160]   So maybe ATT should just concentrate on letting the dinosaurs
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.520]   have their fun until they finally
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.000]   submerge into the tarpets and start laying more pipe for the 4G.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.560]   I think we should all start a little more pipe.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.200]   I'm a late fan.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.080]   No, I say, yeah.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.040]   I totally say, yeah.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.920]   You can't really--
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.840]   That was kind of mean.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.240]   Root for phone companies, can you?
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   No.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:40.520]   Like a--
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.040]   Not allowed.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.960]   Not allowed, no.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   No.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.360]   Dude, you're a barista.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.440]   Apple snare's top smartphone sales spot.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.680]   Say that five.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.840]   That's a tongue twister Macworld magazine.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:53.840]   Try it again.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.600]   Did your head line writer do that on purpose?
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.360]   Did Greg do that?
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.160]   Or did you have a--
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.520]   We did that to trip you up.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.480]   Apple snare's top smartphone sales spot.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.120]   Ha ha.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.620]   Wow.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.600]   It's fine as long as--
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.200]   Top smartphone sales spot.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.400]   Try it like so best with a cat.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.720]   Apple snare's top smartphone's them.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.240]   Oh, god.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.240]   I just got the mic all the way.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.280]   OK, we may have broken the equipment.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.720]   [HELICOPTER]
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   Yeah, but this is that market share stuff, right?
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.480]   Which is just what 4S came out.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.440]   And Apple sold a lot of phones.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.320]   Everybody, were you in the group that
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.480]   said, oh, the 4S is not that big a deal.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.720]   It's the iPhone 4 with a few extra little.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.520]   How could it possibly be?
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.080]   So--
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.440]   Well, there's two groups, right?
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.720]   There's the groups who are like, oh my god, the iPhone 5
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.320]   is coming out.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.720]   It's going to be like a floating--
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   Right.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.520]   --a little way.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.040]   --and a little way.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.320]   --a little way negative weight and little float and fly.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.960]   And then there are the people who are like, well,
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.120]   they'll be on the iPhone.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.680]   And if you look at Apple's past history,
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   you'll see that generally they're on a two-year cycle.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.920]   And they do an incremental upgrade
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.560]   because most people are on two-year contracts.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.600]   It's a TikTok.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   And they're four.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.040]   So this is the Tik.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.680]   And the talk is--
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.520]   And most people who buy an iPhone 4S
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   will be people who have 3GS, not four.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.080]   And so it's a big step up for them.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.400]   Right.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:54:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.400]   Because Apple knows most of their people
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.600]   are on these two-year contracts.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.920]   Well, Apple, well, for this year then
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.040]   because there'll be another whole group of people
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.440]   who bought an iPhone 4--
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.480]   Coming off their contract.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.640]   --coming off their contract.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.320]   And from all reports, the iPhone 5
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.000]   will be a significant modification.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.160]   It won't look the same, right?
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.800]   We would assume.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.680]   One would doesn't know.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.180]   Right.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.280]   I don't know.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.240]   I read a lot of this iPhone 5 reports last year.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:22.760]   I know.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.440]   Nothing.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:23.920]   Nothing.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   That knows what they mean.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.440]   So--
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.320]   But people-- yeah, some people were just freaking out
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.560]   that it was-- oh, no, it's only faster and better,
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.120]   but not revolutionary.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.920]   Oh, no.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.440]   It's just a Siri in the camera.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:36.600]   It's only faster--
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   And the due course process.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.120]   --be these to you.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.600]   And does your bidding via spoken commands?
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:40.880]   Oh, no.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.920]   Well, right.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.960]   You know, I love Siri, but I've got to admit,
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.760]   it's Siri's down a lot, right?
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.560]   Is it just me?
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.120]   Siri's often unresponsive to me.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.320]   Maybe she doesn't like you.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.280]   Maybe she doesn't.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:53.680]   There you go.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.240]   I made her call me gorgeous--
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.080]   I'm not sure if I buy this.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.360]   Go ahead.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   I'm not sure if I buy this every year, sort of thing,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.840]   though, because by now, I think that the customer base has
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.480]   become so fragmented that for the first couple of years,
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.680]   it was all the people who bought it in June
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.960]   as soon as it came out.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.640]   Now you're buying it as soon as your old contract expired,
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.320]   or maybe you're holding on for another few months
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.040]   until you decide that an iPhone is the right one for you.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.800]   And there's so many carriers internationally
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.840]   that I really think that the hardware comes out
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.560]   when Apple thinks it's ready to come out,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.680]   I think for no other reason.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.720]   It makes the thing less predictable.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.000]   I mean, I think in the long term,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.120]   the two-year contract thing is silly because--
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.560]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.960]   --so many things that are overseas that
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.880]   don't even have that now.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.440]   But I think--
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:37.720]   It's archaic.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.080]   It's from comes from a time when phones didn't evolve as fast.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.000]   I do feel like from Apple's perspective,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.200]   they had this kind of constant refinement thing
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.480]   where they don't want to overhaul the entire phone
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.880]   and make it look completely different every time.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.320]   And so whether it's primarily driven
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.680]   by the two-year contract or not, there is definitely--
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.400]   it's a trend.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.080]   Now, yeah, they may completely blow it up
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.400]   and they'll be an iPhone 4S Q, or there'll
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.120]   be a 5 and a 6 and a 7 in successive years.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.000]   But it seems like they've happened on something here
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.040]   with the big change smaller upgrade--
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.560]   It's smart.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.560]   --it's just smaller.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.640]   And if the iPhone's 4S sold that well in 2011,
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.080]   get ready because Apple's results are going to be even more
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.040]   through the roof in 2012 because I think an iPhone 5
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.280]   will be even more compelling.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.320]   Although to Andy's point, there's
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.280]   selling a lot of phones that aren't those people waiting
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.600]   in line in those Samsung commercials.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.280]   There's something I threw out.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.080]   Absolutely.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.960]   And that's the point is that now it's a huge market.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.440]   And that's why they are the top seller of smartphones
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.000]   last quarter.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.840]   Samsung's still number one for 2011.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.200]   But the last quarter was huge for Apple, obviously,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.400]   if it's other quarterly results.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.680]   And having Verizon and Sprint in the game just helps.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.160]   And I think watch out.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.280]   Do you think it'll be next September?
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.160]   They'll do it September releases now.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:54.720]   Wow.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.320]   Who knows?
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.920]   I don't know what I think anymore.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.880]   I think they're waiting for LT, the hardware,
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.920]   to become practical for the iPhone.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.480]   I think this can be the next big step up.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:04.960]   I agree.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.160]   They need to be 4G.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.000]   I agree.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.040]   The interesting thing to me though,
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.840]   is that I really think that part of the trend for the iPhone
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.560]   market is now that the first couple of generations of users
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.840]   were real, not only Apple people in terms of people
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.240]   who are fans of the logo, but people who are fans of that kind
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.480]   of style, that kind of design, people whose needs were not
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.000]   being met by any other phone that was out there at the time.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.920]   Now, the market play, the people, the community of iPhone
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.400]   users are just more civilians.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.720]   They're more normal people.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.480]   My point exactly.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.200]   It was time to get forward.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.520]   But that also means that I don't think normal people look to
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.000]   buy a phone, replace their phone every year.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.040]   They really do.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.840]   Only when their contract expires do they become dimly aware
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.000]   that they can now get a new phone without having to pay any
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.760]   sort of an extra penalty for it.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.920]   And even then they'll think, yeah, it's working fine for me.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.800]   The same ADAPs.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.280]   I only really use 8 to 10 apps.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.680]   They're working fine for me.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.240]   That's fine.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:05.040]   The one thing I would say about that is that these sales
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.360]   figures we saw for the iPhone 4S suggest that they may
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.960]   not know exactly when they're out of contract, but they know
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.040]   when there's a new phone that they want to buy.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.160]   Because clearly, even though they might not have been
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.920]   waiting in line, Apple sold a huge number.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.560]   It was a huge sales spike, the first quarter that the 4S
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.160]   was available.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   So the availability of a new phone--
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.640]   It's 30 million phones.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.240]   Within the first three months, they sold a whole lot of them.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.080]   There were people who were waiting around or checking to
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.720]   see that their contract was in or out of fashion so that they
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.040]   could just go and say, I want the new iPhone now.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.080]   And so that is--
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.800]   there's something there.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.920]   But it may not be tick, tick, tick.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.600]   Yay, now I can get any phone.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.800]   And then I'll go to the store.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.920]   It may be driven by the fact that there's a big phone
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.400]   announcement.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.960]   And that's what's selling those phones.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.120]   We spend too much time in court on this show, but we're
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.440]   going back to court.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.600]   Motorola.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.160]   Gavill news now.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.960]   Back in the Gavill news.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.680]   Motorola--
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.800]   Because betting IAS you wouldn't go for this.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.400]   I just think it's a great story.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.280]   Why did I ask--
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   Oh, no.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.760]   You don't like to talk patents or--
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.280]   I don't like to talk court cases.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.680]   I don't like to talk patents.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.960]   But you know what got me on this one?
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.280]   Motorola is suing saying they want 2.25% of the revenue
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.560]   from iPhone sales worth a billion dollars.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.960]   That's what got me is the number is so huge.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.200]   Yep.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:34.400]   I guess Motorola has a patent that iPhone fringes upon.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.160]   Microsoft is doing quite well on Android phones, $5 on many
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.360]   Android phones.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.120]   Being an interesting way for--
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.960]   And don't forget, don't forget who owns Motorola.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.480]   I do.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.720]   The G word.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.600]   Google.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.840]   It's Mr. Google owns it.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.320]   Mr. Google?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.800]   I don't know why he's German, but--
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.040]   Yeah, he sounds German.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.040]   He has Google.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   How Google?
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.720]   One billion dollars.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.800]   Boy, the patent stuff is really boring, but it's clearly
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.760]   just-- it's like high stakes poker with lawyers.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.920]   It's all there.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.720]   Lawyer's playing poker.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.400]   And normally, I wouldn't say anything about it.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.560]   But a billion dollars.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.280]   One-- just-- I love the sound of it.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.320]   We're going to take a break coming up that iMessage bug.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.000]   Apparently, Apple settled with one guy.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.800]   But now an Apple store employee says he's being spied on.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.880]   Before we do that, though, let me talk a little bit about
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.960]   gazelle.com.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.240]   We all have gadgets.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.960]   Too many gadgets these days, it seems like.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.280]   But we also have gadget lust.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   You want the next phone.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.640]   You want the iPhone 5.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.280]   What are you going to do?
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.160]   Well, you got-- I guess you could--
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.800]   and I have a drawer full of iPhones.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.600]   I'm ashamed to admit.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.640]   You forget this.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.760]   Go to gazelle and get some money for those
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.080]   to underwrite your habit.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.960]   gazelle.com.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.280]   They will give you cash for your old gadgets.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.800]   And a good amount of money, too.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.560]   Let's say you have a iPod touch.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.040]   One of the more recent ones here, let's say.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.240]   And it's no noticeable flaws working great.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.520]   So this is what you do.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.680]   It's not engraved.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.040]   The battery works.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.400]   I have the AC adapter.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.240]   And the cable is pretty straightforward.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.080]   So they're going to-- 90 bucks.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.480]   Thank you.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.760]   I'll take it.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.920]   Throw that in the box.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.520]   Now, here's a beauty of this.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.600]   It's going to go to their data specialists who will wipe
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.000]   the data so you don't have to even think about that.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.400]   Now, once I've got it in the box,
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.720]   I'm going to add some more to my box.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.640]   Let's see more stuff to sell.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.080]   How about that Samsung galaxy?
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.720]   Now, I no longer need it.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.520]   I've replaced the galaxy S2.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.880]   Let's see what that-- I have the 1777.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.520]   I think that's the one I have.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.200]   Let's say-- maybe you got the sky rocket, right?
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.680]   Or you the 4G, or you want to get the note?
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.520]   Or maybe you just want to get another iPhone
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.800]   because everybody should have more than one iPhone.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.200]   You can make a vest out of them.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.720]   Let's just see.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.200]   I'm curious how much this is worth.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.440]   Oh!
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.040]   I'll take it.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.000]   Throw that in the box.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.920]   Now, they're going to pay your shipping.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.680]   By the way, if a gadget is worth more than a dollar,
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.440]   they'll pay the shipping for it and recycle it.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.520]   And they do the recycling in a green fashion.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.720]   So if it's worthless, you can still throw it in the box.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.840]   They pay the postage.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.560]   And you recycle that sucker.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.120]   And it doesn't go in the landfill.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.280]   It doesn't go overseas.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.440]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.360]   It's a really good way to get rid of your old gadgets.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.960]   GAZELLE.com.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.360]   You can get PayPal, check an Amazon credit, a Walmart credit.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.120]   Get the Amazon credit because you get 5% bonus over and above
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:45.680]   the offer.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.440]   So I just-- what is in my--
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   I have now in my box.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.400]   I have like 300 bucks, right?
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.400]   In my box.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.760]   So I'm going to get an additional $15 just
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.200]   because I'm using Amazon.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.000]   You got to love that.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.040]   Please remember, just like a car when you drive it off the lot,
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.960]   your gadgets are losing value every single day.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.320]   Don't wait.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.360]   Go to gazelle.com to get the best offer.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.160]   Get that cash.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.960]   The sooner you do it, the more money your gadgets are going
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960]   to be worth.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.720]   You can start funding your iPhone savings account
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.600]   for the next one or your next iPad, which will be even sooner.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.840]   GAZELLE.com.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.360]   Recycle the easy way and get cash to boot from gazelle.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.720]   So as long as we're talking about Apple TV,
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.960]   we were talking about Apple TV.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.360]   Hey, how about that Apple TV?
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.240]   How about that Apple TV?
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.960]   There is a rumor on Mac rumors appropriately.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.160]   It comes from the Toronto Globe and Mail.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.000]   Canadian rumor.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.800]   Canadian rumor.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.000]   Hey.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.920]   That Rogers and BCE both have an Apple TV, the new one,
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.480]   like a real TV in their labs.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.200]   According to the Globe and Mail, these two companies
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.680]   are beta testing, such a thing.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.080]   Siri is reportedly integrated into the new television
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.640]   to help you make programming choices.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.160]   You can control the TV with your voice or hand gestures.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.120]   Even an on-screen keyboard can be invoked
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.640]   without any special hardware.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.120]   An on-screen keyboard, meanwhile,
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.480]   can be activated in a similar manner,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.880]   allowing viewers to surf the web,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.960]   conduct video chats and use social media sites,
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.320]   such as Twitter and Facebook,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.640]   all without any physical interface.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   I don't know how that would happen.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   It's magic.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   What do you want this?
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   How would that happen?
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   I don't know.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.360]   What am I typing?
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.560]   I don't get it.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.760]   Now, I have to say that this is remarkably similar
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.520]   to the Microsoft Connect on an Xbox.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.240]   And this TV Samsung showed its CES
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.960]   with a camera on top, with the gestures,
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.720]   and the speech and all of that stuff.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.200]   So it isn't anything that's not existing,
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.320]   but maybe it's an Apple TV, maybe not.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320]   I don't know.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   Globe and Mail is a very reputable newspaper.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.760]   Yeah, but also that's useless without context.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760]   I don't think that anybody's interested
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.600]   in the idea of a voice control TV.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.320]   There is a voice control TV that actually works.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.640]   Yeah, well, even more than that,
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.280]   it's got to have all the content on it.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.320]   I think ultimately, control is going to be important,
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.400]   but also the content deal that Apple's makes, right?
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.520]   Well, and what this suggests, if this story is true,
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.560]   so let's assume that it is.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.720]   What it suggests is a lot of people,
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.480]   when we're talking about these rumors,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.760]   we're saying, well, it can't happen without partners
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.480]   and we haven't heard anything about it,
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.120]   and therefore we know that it isn't real.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.960]   Because whenever there's a leak, it's not from Apple,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.120]   really, it's from the partners that Apple uses,
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.160]   well, here we are.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.840]   It's not at all unreasonable that if Apple's whole idea here
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.560]   is to go out with the support of cable companies
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.160]   and maybe satellite companies,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.320]   that they would have to work with them,
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.320]   and that would be where this would leak from.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.840]   And this is what that is.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.960]   So I think it's more realistic here,
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.000]   that they're trying to make a TV that doesn't just
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.320]   kind of come out where they try to blow
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.600]   the cable companies out of the water.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.520]   Maybe they've realized they can't do that,
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.440]   but they can work with some partners,
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.480]   sort of like what they did with AT&T and the iPhone,
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.840]   to do it, it's probably less good then, right?
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.080]   Because the cable companies will probably put
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.320]   all sorts of restrictions on it,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.880]   but they may not have any other option
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   if they want it to be functional.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.080]   Or maybe it's just for Canada.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.440]   Yeah, but that's why it's--
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.240]   Wouldn't that be fitting?
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.480]   You're writing that, this is one of the distant early warning
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   markers you want to look for, that Apple's locked down
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.960]   pretty type of you would hear it first from a partner
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.040]   that they had got access to the device.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.640]   Interesting, it would be interesting, though,
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.600]   that the first leak would come from Canada,
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.440]   not from the United States, because American cable companies
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.560]   pay their employees just as poorly as Canadian cable
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.720]   companies do.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.160]   And so they're just as disincentivized to simply be
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.800]   the first person to say, hey, guess what I played with today?
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.400]   A?
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.160]   You know, the difference is just now they're
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.520]   doing it to someone named Gord instead of someone named Dave.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:02.880]   Right.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:08.160]   Not all Canadians are named Gord.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:08.840]   Just most.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.600]   Maybe the Mar.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.840]   Nanny, my grandfather.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.080]   My middle name is Gordon.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.160]   So you can call me Gord if you would like.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.400]   In fact, I wish you would.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.760]   I've been dying for you to call me Gord.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.600]   Apple modifies its Yula for iBooks, says, it's OK.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.200]   We don't own your stuff.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.920]   Right.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.880]   Is this another one of those?
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.640]   Well, it kind of sounds like they own your stuff,
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.840]   but they don't really want to own your stuff.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.080]   This is just to protect them so they can reproduce your stuff
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:35.560]   kind of thing.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.160]   Or did they really want to own your stuff?
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.520]   No, they never wanted to be ever good.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.680]   They don't want to own your stuff.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.160]   No, the default of any lawyer is going to be to write it
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.480]   to be as broad as possible.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:44.960]   It's all ours.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.520]   And then there's screaming.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.000]   And what's funny here is they've backed out of all the things,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.360]   except the one that was the most clearly
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.880]   what people were screaming about, which
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.760]   is this idea that any output from iBooks Author
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.720]   in the iBooks format can only be sold on the iBooks store.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.600]   Can be given away anywhere, but it can only be sold through Apple.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.680]   Which, in my mind, is just dumb because it's unnecessary.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.040]   This is a custom format.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.200]   It's not going to run anywhere else.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:07.720]   It won't.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.240]   No.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.080]   But they did clarify it so that if you make a PDF out
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.520]   of what you did in iBooks Author,
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.080]   or if you just have text in there,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.920]   Apple's not asserting that they own the text,
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.120]   or they own the PDF or anything like that.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.800]   It was necessary.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.360]   People who've done books know that sometimes--
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.280]   by the time you have an agreement with a publisher,
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.440]   and now the contract is going to the lawyers,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.840]   it's the lawyers' job to make sure that, oh, wait a minute,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.520]   are you saying that it's not 100% crystal clear that we can
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.000]   have the right to publish this material?
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.920]   I'm sorry, whatever.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.360]   Can you call Apple and have them send you a sign,
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.160]   and then you say, oh, I can't call Apple and tell them
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.320]   to do that.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.560]   So if they hadn't actually clarified that document,
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.600]   it would have made it really difficult to go forward
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.080]   with a lot of different publishing projects.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.240]   And it seems silly, but we had this where we were talking
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.720]   with a print-on-demand company about some of our eBooks,
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.520]   doing a print version.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.120]   It's fairly cool.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.960]   And they had some terrible--
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.920]   lots of this fine print, this legal text, actually,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.640]   it's horrifying to hear this.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.480]   But it gets copied and pasted from other documents.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.800]   And they don't even know what's in it.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.880]   And in this case, it was a print-on-demand company that
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.440]   was asserting that they owned all the rights to the content.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   They shared the rights with you, which if you read the fine print,
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.960]   what you're saying is if we happen
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.840]   to publish self-publish the great American novel that's
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.320]   going to be cited as the greatest 21st century novel
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.600]   in 50 years, and I accidentally did a few 100 copies
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.480]   on print-on-demand, whoever owns the rights
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.560]   to that long deceased company, could go into court and say,
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.440]   look, you signed away the rights, and we own it too,
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.800]   and we're going to publish our own version of it.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.040]   So I think it's why you got to protect yourself.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.640]   It's a legitimate thing to consider, and it should be changed,
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   and I'm glad Apple changed it.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.360]   And this is the exact problem, which
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.120]   is you're going to have a lot of neophyte authors who
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.200]   don't know enough to look at these contracts.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.120]   Somebody like John C. de Voreck, you better believe he's
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.280]   got somebody, and he's not going to do it if it's not
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:56.960]   in his interest.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.000]   But most of the people who will be using iBooks
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.360]   might not have that eye for risk.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.200]   So I think it is something that needs to be changed.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.360]   I'm glad they changed it.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.040]   We had the whole story about Google and Apple making
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.240]   deals not to recruit one another's employees.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.440]   That's apparently over, because Google has just
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.600]   hired Apple's senior director of product integrity
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.920]   for a secret project.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.160]   Venture Beat said that Simon Prakash
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.840]   may even be working alongside Sergey Brin, the founder
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.920]   of Google, or under Motorola Mobility.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.440]   Prakash was at Apple for eight years
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   responsible for product quality across the entire line
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.320]   from iPhones to Max.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.000]   Interesting.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.120]   And now it's pure speculation that we'll
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.160]   be working on Google X's wearable heads up display glasses.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.200]   I wonder where they got that.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   Google X, the secret secret project.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.440]   Now remember, Apple makes up crap.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.640]   We've learned this last time that secret projects
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.840]   for new employees just to see if they're going to tell
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.800]   anybody.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.400]   And they don't let you work on a real project
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.360]   until they verify that you are not going to tell anybody.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.400]   I bet you Google's just the same thing.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.720]   Yeah, Simon, you'll be working on Project X.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.440]   The size which I thought Project X
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.880]   was like involved a robot that drives a car.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.040]   It sounds like exactly the drives would sound like you'd
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.400]   make up if you were going to tell somebody something that
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.240]   wasn't true, right?
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.040]   Project X wearable headgear.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.280]   It's a robot that wears--
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.800]   X-rays back and drives a car.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.640]   Don't tell anybody.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.880]   I think it was the New York Times that first was speculating
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.200]   about this a year ago.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.560]   And even at the time, I remember reading this and thinking
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.520]   that you can't-- do you realize that this is an industry
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.120]   that people are willing to put plastic into their eyes
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.480]   every single morning?
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.160]   People are willing to have laser beams fired
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   into their eyeballs burning away to--
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:57.680]   That's true.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   That's true.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.120]   --to avoid putting something on their face
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.520]   that looks like glasses.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.840]   And you're going to get people to voluntarily do that
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.320]   just to see more Google ads.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.920]   I'm going to wander around with a helmet.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.920]   I like it.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.840]   Apple warns of crackdown on those who would manipulate their
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.480]   Apple Store rankings.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.800]   They send a reminder out to developers.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   They said, when you promote your app--
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.080]   because apparently they're these services.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.680]   I didn't know this.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.520]   That you pay them money and they guarantee you'll get in the
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.000]   top 25 of free apps.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.600]   They use bots and stuff.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.240]   They have these botnets that will automatically--
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.080]   it only works for free apps, of course, because they have
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.560]   these botnets that end hundreds, if not thousands, of
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.160]   different iTunes accounts that will just automatically
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.640]   download these free apps and bring your rankings up.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.520]   There are some botnets that supposedly will also use stolen
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.400]   iTunes card numbers to drive up their rankings for actually
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.160]   cheap paid apps too.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.200]   And so someone was actually-- it first came to light when
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.880]   the developer was posting to a forum saying that this company
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.440]   came and approached me and promised me that for $5,000 I
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.280]   could actually get an app in the top 10.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.040]   And they said, we got eight apps in there right now.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.600]   They told them which one they were.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.440]   He did not take very nicely to that.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.160]   Five grand they wanted.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.800]   Yeah, there's a link I just pasted in the chat room, actually,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.080]   for a story that Lex Friedman wrote for us.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.440]   It's called The Towson Hack.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.560]   And it's related because I think this is the source of
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.000]   people reporting that their iTunes credit is missing.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.880]   And it seems to be buying in-app purchases that are small
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.080]   or individual apps.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.040]   And it sounds like there's this whole dark net of iTunes
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.080]   manipulation going on that seems to all be about promoting
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.840]   apps so that they go up the charts so that more people see
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.240]   them, which then drives legitimate sales.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:49.520]   It doesn't surprise me because it's a huge and great value
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.000]   to be so high on that chart.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.760]   Wherever there's this kind of money, there's going to be
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.920]   people trying to scan.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.520]   So I think it's cool that Apple basically said, if you are
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.640]   somebody who is paying to have your app promoted using these
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.520]   guys, we're going to shut you down.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.800]   We're not just going to shut down the guys running the bot
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:06.960]   net.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.560]   We're going to shut you and your apps down.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.320]   And that's good because what you end up with is really
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.240]   crappy apps.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.480]   It's like all the people making the knockoff apps.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.640]   They see a popular app.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.120]   They make a really cheap knockoff with a similar name, put
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.600]   the name of the app in their description as something similar.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.400]   And then they try to quickly make a bunch of sales from it
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.560]   and people get ripped off.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.680]   So apparently the guy who is pitching this guy--
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.040]   the post is on Touch Arcade.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.440]   The Touch Arcade forum at Walter Cayman posting, he says,
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.680]   the guy who was trying to sell me this said, it's only five
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:40.960]   grand.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.320]   We've marked it down because Apple's on our tail.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.520]   And we're going to give it to you for a special deal.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.840]   Tiny pets-- they claim--
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.380]   tiny pets, social girl, fluff friends, pet town, crime city,
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.000]   VIP poker, sweet shop and top girl, all free apps are all
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.600]   clients of theirs.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.720]   And I have to admit, I don't know.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.400]   These are not the apps that leap out at me as being the
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.360]   apps that I'm familiar with.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.280]   Anyway, I think because of this forum post, Apple, which
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.760]   was just a couple of days ago, was on February 5th, Apple
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.680]   has responded and said, don't do it.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.920]   We'll get you.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.000]   Did you download?
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.360]   There's a big 1.3 gigabytes for me update for OS 10.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.000]   Is it that big for everybody?
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.280]   Whew, it's huge.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.560]   Apparently breaking some power PC apps.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.960]   I don't know why.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.560]   Right on Stell Leopard.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.560]   Is it Kill Rosetta?
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.480]   Yeah, or it kills for some people with some apps.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.080]   It kills Rosetta.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.760]   Because you can't run quick and online anyway.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:50.960]   Right.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.720]   And he's Rosetta.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.220]   Right.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:52.960]   So it would have to be.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.120]   So it's on Snow Leopard.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.320]   Yeah, somebody was saying, where is the person in Rosetta
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.600]   quality assurance at Apple?
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.880]   And the answer is that person got laid off or something.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.240]   Because Rosetta's going on.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.160]   He's working on Project X.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.840]   I think they just didn't even pay attention to it.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.120]   I think Rosetta is so far in Apple's review mirror that
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.160]   they didn't even realize this was going to happen.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   This is a big update.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.960]   And I'm sure want to download tons of security.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.040]   Yeah, 1.34 gigabytes on this machine as well.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.360]   Operating six, some fixes.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.040]   It's so big because it's the combo update.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.680]   There was a delta update that just makes changes.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:26.880]   And it--
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.240]   What happened to that?
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:28.680]   They pulled it.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.360]   They joked.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360]   It broke stuff.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:30.880]   Right.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.380]   Right.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.240]   They said we're not--
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.320]   Get rid of that.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.160]   And now they replaced it with this combo, which is huge.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.320]   When scroll bars and push buttons get screwed up by an
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.960]   update, not good.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.920]   It's a bad sign.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.240]   And then you know that, oh, dear.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.320]   Something went very wrong.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.520]   The link that Apple provides for the security content of this
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.760]   update is apparently--
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.880]   It's because it either walks through a
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.520]   director of product integrity.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.400]   That's why this happened.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.080]   Apparently--
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.240]   He's making sunglasses to Google now.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.720]   --a non-existent page.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.560]   OK.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.440]   Maybe it's just me.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.200]   I don't know.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.800]   But that is a big update.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.400]   10.7.3.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.720]   But as always, with security updates of this kind, you got
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.160]   to do it.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.840]   And I've done it now in a number of machines.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.640]   I haven't had a problem.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.160]   You haven't heard any problems with it.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.720]   Now that everybody's got the combo update instead of the
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   delta update.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.880]   Get the full combo update.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.120]   Why do they call it the Towson Act?
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.560]   Is it because of Towson, Maryland?
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.880]   A bunch of the early charges came from Towson, Maryland.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.680]   A little nervous.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.000]   I just saw this in the chat room.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.800]   We'll do one more story.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.360]   Then we'll get your picks and your tips and so forth.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.600]   I am a big path user.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.720]   I'm sure many of you are.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.560]   Also, Path is really cool.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.720]   It is kind of Dave Moran's company.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.280]   He left Facebook to start this.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.360]   The idea of Path was you have a limited number of friends.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.920]   Unlike Facebook, you're limited 150 friends.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.600]   And it's just beautiful on the iPhone.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.880]   In fact, it won a crunchy for the best design app on the
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.240]   iPhone.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.440]   Just really nice.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.040]   According to a guy writing in Singapore, Aaron Tampi on his
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.560]   blog, which is McLovin.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.040]   I like the name.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.360]   mclov.in.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:09.080]   Path apparently uploads your entire contact list, including
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.320]   full names, emails, and phone numbers to their servers.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320]   Wasn't there some other app that did this and got in
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:15.960]   trouble too?
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.360]   I feel like I've seen this story before.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.120]   That they upload your stuff because they wanted to let you
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.960]   connect with your friends and all of that.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.680]   Yeah, it's part of that.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.760]   And obviously, they're doing a server side.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.640]   So as many apps do, they say, would you like us to find
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.480]   other people using Path in your contact list?
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.320]   And you say, yes.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.600]   And instead of doing a client side, which might take a
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.320]   while, they just upload the whole thing and go through it.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.000]   OK, just let you know.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.280]   That doesn't bother me.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.400]   I think it's disclosure.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.760]   Disclosure and having a clear privacy policy are the
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.320]   issues, right?
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.800]   If they say that they're doing it, they let you choose not
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.120]   to, and they say, we're not going to do anything with it
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.200]   and we'll throw it away, then it's not as big a deal.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.480]   It's probably something anybody should be aware of when
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.840]   an app says, how would you like me to find other friends?
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.880]   And it says, give me your Facebook, Twitter, and
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.360]   credentials in your contact list.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.000]   And chances are, that also means, though, they have the
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.160]   ability to post right into your Twitter.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.560]   That is always the case.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.080]   When they ask for those permissions, look at
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.680]   carefully on the permissions, it says, because it says this
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.280]   on Facebook, not only can it read your Facebook, but it's
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.840]   allowed to post as you.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.280]   And chances are it will.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:21.960]   Really?
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.880]   Most of those, it'll be like, I just installed this
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.280]   great app.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.520]   You should install it, too.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.760]   And it's automatically posted.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.000]   They should ask.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.240]   There should be a checkbox.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.960]   And Twitter, there's no privilege that says, I want to
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.240]   read your tweets, but not post them.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:36.560]   Right?
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.120]   That's the problem.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.000]   Twitter doesn't even make it available.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:38.880]   Yeah, it's not available.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.800]   Yeah, well, what are they going to do?
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.560]   I like path.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.680]   And I think Dave is a great guy.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.680]   I doubt very much that they're doing anything nefarious there.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.040]   But--
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.840]   You just have to come out and be clear about what they're
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.040]   doing.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.960]   Yeah, I'm sure that this just came out today,
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.640]   ten minutes ago.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.840]   So I'm sure they'll have something to say about it.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.680]   Let us take a break and come back with our tips and our
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.280]   picks of the week.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.920]   But I'm going to start with a pick, because we're all three
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.080]   of us Audible users.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:05.160]   I believe I'm correct on stating that.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.040]   Audible.com, if you want to get a free book, go to
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.840]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.360]   That's a book of months.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.280]   Subscription, the first month's free, your first book's
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:14.560]   free.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.320]   Cancel anytime so you pay nothing.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.120]   But the book is yours to keep forever.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.400]   I am listening to the new Stephen King, which I love,
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.760]   11, 22, 63.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.640]   It's wonderful.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.160]   Craig Watson, the narrator, does a great job with the
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.560]   accents and the voices.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.320]   It's one of my favorite rears in a long time.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.200]   And then the other one to listen to, because Game of
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.160]   Thrones is coming back.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.560]   Season two will be The Clash of Kings.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.520]   And it's in my opinion, you should read the book first.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.320]   It actually helps you understand what the hell's going
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.680]   on in the TV show, because they compress so much.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.040]   Even though they've got hours, it's like 10 episodes, but
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.920]   it's still heavily compressed.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.480]   And I noticed this in the TV show, I had read the book, so
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.840]   it didn't confuse me.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.600]   But I'm curious if somebody who hadn't read the books
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.720]   watched the TV show if they understood, because it's
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.680]   going like boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the one
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.680]   who takes a close off, and then boom, boom, boom, boom,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.920]   and then the one who takes a close off.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.760]   So that's why I watched the TV show, because I'm just
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.960]   waiting for somebody to take the close off.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.840]   But in the book, you can imagine it.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.000]   That just did not come out right.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.320]   But did you read the book first?
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.000]   No, I hadn't.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.320]   And I watched the series, and I was constantly asking
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:18.920]   talk questions.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.880]   What the hell's going on?
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.280]   What is going on?
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.200]   Wait, what?
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.640]   I had to explain to my wife, I'd be like, OK, he's the
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.520]   brother of the book.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.040]   The rears the book.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.760]   And anyway, the book is so good.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.080]   I mean, it's not anything wrong with the show.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.640]   I love the show.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.320]   But I am glad I had read the book first.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.480]   I think your kings might be the best one.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.000]   Is it the best book?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.200]   The second book, I think, might be the best book.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.200]   I'm just reading it now, is it?
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:39.560]   No, I think--
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.320]   Oh, third one's pretty good too.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:41.920]   It's good.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.320]   Can I skip the first one?
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.120]   No.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.400]   I have to read the first one.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.080]   So you need to-- this is why you need Audible.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.880]   See, OK, so now if you're going to read it, you've got to
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.920]   find the time to read it somewhere.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.600]   You can hold a book.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.360]   That means at home in the nice cozy chair and bed, fall asleep
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:54.880]   immediately.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.560]   I'm guaranteeing you every time three pages in.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.000]   That's for me anyway, because I'm an old man.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.720]   I need a giant screen.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.600]   So I listen.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.400]   The thing is, you're listening when you're driving, when you're
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.680]   at the gym, when there's blood coursing through your brain.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.280]   So you actually stay awake while you're doing your gardening
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:10.840]   or housework.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.240]   It's great.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.240]   All those times that you couldn't hold a book.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.640]   But you've got to-- you know, hours a day.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.880]   And this is so awesome.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.760]   And so if you're trying to catch up, Eileen and everybody
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.120]   else, the best way to do it, go to Audible.com.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.160]   And what a good deal.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.880]   A clash of kings, which is the second book.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.960]   So read the first one if you haven't read a Game of Thrones.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.120]   It's 37 hours.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.440]   So you need to do this.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440]   But it's so good.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.440]   And it draws you in and you love it.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.240]   And yours for free if you go to Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.320]   Of course, it plays on every device you've got.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.440]   And I have to say, I love the Audible app.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.480]   I've been using that almost exclusively on the iPhone now.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.120]   There's an Audible app for Android as well.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.080]   But it's just great to listen to a book on Audible on the app.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.160]   And they get badges.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.440]   They've gamified it, which is kind of fun too.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.760]   The app has-- the nice thing about the app
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.160]   it has your entire-- here's my stats.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.120]   I'm only a newbie.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.680]   I got to work on that.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.200]   The app has your entire library.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.120]   Every book you've ever purchased on Audible is always there.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.720]   And that is so cool.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.160]   Because you can go back and read any book you've ever listened
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:13.800]   to on Audible.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.840]   They're all yours.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.520]   By the way, 500 plus books in my library.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.760]   So it's really like a library library.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.440]   So everything is in here.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.840]   It's wonderful.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.440]   I just can't sell it enough.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.720]   If you're not yet an Audible member,
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.120]   and I doubt there very many of you who haven't become members,
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.600]   this is a great way to try it.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.600]   Your first book's free at audible.com/macbreak.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   Andy, what are you listening to?
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.400]   I get such good recommendations from you.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.040]   Actually, one that-- for some reason,
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.560]   I rarely get fiction on Audible because it's so hard for me
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.640]   to find something I like.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.120]   I wound up actually getting Mrs. Pettigrew
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.800]   lives for a day.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.320]   Because I saw the last 10 minutes of it
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.640]   on the movie version of this on HBO.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.200]   And found out that the book not only
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.880]   was I interested in the book because it's really cool,
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:04.440]   like 1920s, 1930s novel, the kind that really
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.360]   is nicely fun and consumable novel.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.680]   But I also found out that it was--
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.320]   this version was released to be timed with the release
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.000]   of the movie.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.800]   And it's narrated by Francis McDormand.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.520]   Oh, I love her.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.040]   Exactly.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.560]   And this is another case of--
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.680]   my interest in the book-- the content itself
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.160]   was, I don't know, three out of five.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.520]   And Chris in the actual narrator reading this book
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.680]   was five out of five.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.080]   So it's good stuff.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.840]   She doesn't use the Chief Marge voice from Fargo.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   But her natural voice is good.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.400]   Aw, sure.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.160]   You like it.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:38.680]   Aw, yeah.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.160]   Aw, yeah.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.680]   Yeah, sure.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.560]   Oh, geez.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.880]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.440]   Now, see this is-- now you see the problem.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.960]   There's so many great things on here.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.000]   It's hard to pick just one.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.600]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.320]   Your first book's free do give it a try today.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.160]   Normally, we would have Mr. Lindsey do an iOS tip,
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:56.880]   but he's not here.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.080]   Do you want to give us a tip for me?
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:58.920]   I have no tips.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.960]   All right.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.160]   Andy, do you want to do a Lion tip or an iOS tip
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:02.960]   or an OS 10 tip?
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.400]   All yours, my friend.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.920]   I will give a quick iOS tip.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.200]   Oh, good.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.360]   Actually, I'll give two tips, one
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   because someone clever sent me a iOS tip.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.560]   If you're using the split keyboard on the iPad,
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.360]   please.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.720]   Actually, I happen to have an iPad right here, which
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.480]   I already cooked in a 45 degree oven.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.200]   What, really?
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.280]   No.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.400]   I was not prepared to do an iOS tip,
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.520]   but I now realize that I'm actually doing one.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.720]   There you go.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.640]   Now, you probably already realize that there is--
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.080]   come on.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.480]   I used to using it.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.320]   There you go.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.080]   You already probably already know that there is a way
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.240]   to split the keyboard.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.080]   That if you hold your thumb on the keyboard button like that,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.640]   a pop-up menu that will let you split it like that
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.320]   and turn it into two halves like so.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.040]   A lot of people don't really like that so much
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:11.600]   because they don't like having to split the keyboard
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.200]   the way that iOS splits it.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.280]   Like they expect--
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.000]   on this side here, you've got the--
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.640]   it splits between the T and the Y
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.520]   and the QWERTY roll row.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.640]   However, what I did not know until someone pointed out to me
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.400]   is that Apple has actually included invisible keys
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.560]   for the keyboard so that the button, the key--
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.280]   if you touch directly to the left or the Y button
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.280]   on this left side, you will actually get the letter T.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.680]   And if you tap directly to the right of the letter T,
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.440]   you will get the letter Y.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.760]   And it's true for every single row of the keyboard.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.240]   There is an invisible duplicate of the key
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.040]   that should be right next to it,
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.800]   right next to the virtual version of it.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.280]   So if you are--
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.120]   so if your brain is simply saying that, oh, gee,
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.960]   if your brain is telling you that the T
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.840]   is supposed to be next to the Y, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.160]   It will actually register for it.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.560]   It just won't give you a visual cue
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.640]   that it's actually there.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.360]   And so that's the iOS tip.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.920]   I'm afraid that I was not prepared to do an iOS tip,
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.960]   so I'm sure that whoever sent this tip to me
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.840]   should be thanked, but I will not be thanking him or her
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.960]   because I can't remember your name.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.520]   Thank you, Mask Man, whoever you are.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.200]   There you go.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.040]   Thank you, Mask Man.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:20.520]   Yes.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.160]   My iOS tip, however, my Mask Quest tip
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.360]   was reminded of by tidbits, their great tidbits page.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.440]   If you're ever curious to know some of the details
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.520]   about your Wi-Fi connection, if you actually just hold
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.520]   on the option key while you click on the Wi-Fi menulet,
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.680]   it will not just give you a list of Wi-Fi hotspots.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.320]   It will actually give you a detailed list of all the details
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.000]   about your connection to your current hotspot.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.360]   So if you want to know what channel I hooked up to,
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.200]   Emma, is this a secure connection or is it not a secure
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:53.880]   connection?
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.000]   What's my speed, all that kind of stuff?
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   Hold on the option key, you'll get it.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:58.560]   The extra tip is--
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.680]   It shows it in gray for the current one,
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.480]   but actually if you mouse over any of the others,
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.000]   it'll also give you the super detailed data on the other.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.680]   That's for the honest bonus tip.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:07.520]   Ooh.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.560]   Even if you're not--
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.160]   You hold the mouse to the hotspot.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.840]   Oh, after holding on the option key, oh, no.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.340]   There it is.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:13.480]   It pops up.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.200]   So if you want to swap around and figure out
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.440]   what other hotspot you might be able to use,
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.200]   like if you're on an open one, you want to use your one.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.200]   These are all the neighbors.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:28.400]   They're all too smart for me.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.120]   Oh, there's a web.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.280]   We can crack that.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.720]   Ah, very handy.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.560]   Well, you're not supposed to use it for that.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.640]   Because that means--
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.960]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.640]   They're cracking our bandwidths.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.080]   We got more bandwidth than they do.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.480]   I'm not worried.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.400]   Thank you for two tips.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.280]   Count them two tips.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.160]   And now, I do believe Jason has a pick for us to speak.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.000]   I do have a pick.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:48.600]   Yes, sir.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.680]   My pick is--
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.080]   The king of the Mac Gems.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.560]   You ought to have a pick.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.480]   This is an iPhone app.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.120]   That's even better.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.440]   It's from AppCubby.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.360]   It's called Launch Center.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.760]   It's $2.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.160]   Very clever utility to quickly launch things on your iPhone.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.120]   It's got a flashlight toggle right there.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.800]   You can set it to quickly call specific contacts
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.080]   at specific numbers.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.800]   In any app that you have that has a URL scheme, which is--
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.280]   I know-- a really nerdy thing.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.360]   But it's actually--
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:18.880]   Many do.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.240]   It'll list a bunch of apps.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.360]   It'll list the apps that it knows you have.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.640]   And it lists the apps that it also supports
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.040]   in case you want to go get them.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.040]   And you can do things like, say, open the Bluetooth window
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.720]   in the settings file, or open my direct messages
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.000]   in my Twitter client.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.920]   And so you can do these kind of quick shortcuts
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:40.720]   of various parts of your iPhone that you might otherwise
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.160]   have to do multiple steps or have a bunch of different things
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.040]   on your home screen.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.160]   And instead, you just tap on Launch Center
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.880]   and then tap on any of the things you want to configure.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.560]   Send an iMessage to a particular person.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.120]   It's nice and it's new.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.160]   So I think it's going to grow.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:59.760]   And the guy at AppCubby is going to add a bunch more
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.120]   features.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:04.280]   But it's a nice quick access feature for your iPhone stuff.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:04.960]   Very cool.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.520]   And is there a cost?
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.520]   $2.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.240]   $2.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:08.720]   Very good.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.640]   Well, $199.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.480]   Because Apple--
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.160]   --apples in your head.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:12.920]   Apple keeps the penny.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.920]   Apple knows that that penny means something.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.480]   You keep that penny.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.080]   I have a little button on my--
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.680]   this is always good for blinding people.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.240]   It's a flashlight button.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.160]   I could bright, brighter, bright-est.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.040]   Now you want to know the battery life now?
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.080]   Ah-ha!
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:32.040]   Don't-- no need to shut it off, Leo.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.040]   It'll just shut itself off off the battery now.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.920]   And just a matter of minutes.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.080]   The whole thing is dead.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.440]   But you know, I do that.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.800]   Actually, it's good to have that button,
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.800]   because I often just turn on the face of it.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.160]   It's not quite bright enough.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.400]   And you've got the great LED flash on here,
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.760]   might as well make it a flashlight.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.800]   It's great.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.680]   AppCubby.com, Launch Center.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.840]   And your pick of the week, Mr. Hianatko.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.760]   My pick of the week is from tidbits publishing.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.800]   Probably one of the gutsyest selections.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.320]   They're the most gutsy way to enter the app market ever.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.600]   Adam Axt and Peter Lewis decided
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.880]   that they're sick and tired of waiting for Apple
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:17.440]   to create a Mac OS version of iBooks.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.480]   Given that they're really into electronic publishing,
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.280]   given how important the ePub format has been,
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.240]   and given how absolutely crummy they
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:29.480]   think that all the other Mac OS ePub readers have been,
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.520]   they decided to build their own something that's really
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.960]   designed to look as good as a Mac OS app could look.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.040]   This is-- so they created an app called Bookle,
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.600]   working with another company.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.880]   And it's a really cool ePub reader,
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.760]   because it's very library oriented.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.720]   It doesn't have that really way cool bookshelf motif.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.480]   It's more iTunes-like, in which you have a column of the books
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.880]   that you have, and it'll always easily navigate through them
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.520]   chapter by chapter, do searches,
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.800]   adjust the appearance of it, that sort of stuff.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.240]   It's a very, very clean, very, very efficient app.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.120]   It's also worthy of a recommendation,
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.360]   because knowing the people who are involved with this,
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.760]   a strong 1.0 from these people indicates how awesome the 1.5
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.400]   is going to be eventually.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.360]   So I have to say, this version 1.0 is not really loaded
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.760]   with a lot of flashy treatments.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.120]   It's-- there's not a lot of reflections and shadows in here.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.520]   I would also put the more serious complaint that I
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:36.760]   don't-- I think that they parse the ePub in a very linear fashion.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:40.000]   They don't really do anything to make it more readable.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.400]   Like iBooks will adjust the line spacing,
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.760]   adjust default paragraph styles to make it as pretty
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.040]   to read as possible.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.440]   When you open an ePub in Bookle in 1.0,
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:53.480]   it looks very much like HTML 1.2, 1.4.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.080]   Not as very most--
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.520]   And DSC Mosaic in appearance.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:03.160]   But I'm sure they're going to be improving that as time goes by.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.480]   As it is right now--
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.640]   It doesn't do page breaks, which they could add.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.360]   And of course, it doesn't support the DRM eBooks,
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.680]   but there are lots of non-DRM eBooks out there too.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.200]   Right.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.480]   But for now, I mean, as it is right now,
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.760]   I have a whole folder full of ePub files
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.880]   that I've downloaded that it really makes no sense
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.160]   that my default position is if I want to read these,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.560]   even if I'm sitting at my desk, I have
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.560]   to move it onto my iPad or onto another device
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.800]   before I can actually read it.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.400]   This is good for keeping all those documentation pieces,
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.960]   all of those public domain books that you've downloaded off
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.640]   the net.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:39.080]   And you can actually read them on your desktop.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.800]   It's especially good for reference books,
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.240]   especially the way that it keeps them all
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.760]   collated together into a library.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.240]   So I think it has a ways to go, but really good opening
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:48.560]   effort.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.160]   It's $9.99, which is not dirt cheap.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.560]   But as I said, produced by these people in this company,
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.320]   I'm really very much very confident that this is an investment
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.640]   in a really, really awesome 1.5 and an absolute kick, 2.0.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:07.240]   But I do say that this is one of the gutsyest moves
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.960]   that they could possibly make because there's
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.840]   just this ticking clock somewhere in Cupertino
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.040]   of this fully functional version of Mac OS iBooks
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.200]   that Apple is just waiting to release for the right sort
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.480]   of product launch.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:23.640]   And so they might have to revamp the app
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.480]   if and when that app gets released.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.400]   But the thing is, you need this app now.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.680]   And who knows when Apple or if they're ever
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.680]   going to release a Mac OS version of my book.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.720]   So a hearty recommendation.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.720]   And I'm wishing the best of luck for this.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.040]   Yeah, when or if I think they waited a long time figuring
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.280]   Apple would do this.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:40.920]   And they never have.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.560]   And some of us think, well, why would you
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.080]   want to read a book on your Mac and not on your iPad
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:45.640]   or your iPhone?
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.600]   But the fact is, every time we release an e-book,
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.400]   there's somebody who writes us an angry email saying,
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.760]   why can't I read this on my Mac?
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.200]   So there are people out there who want this.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.400]   And it's great that they're doing it.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.200]   Does a Kindle app not read it?
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.920]   No, doesn't read any pubs.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.040]   No, it's it stands.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:00.480]   It's the report.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.040]   Anything like that.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:01.080]   Right.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.320]   There's one open source app.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.240]   Yeah, Stansi--
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240]   No, not Stansi.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.160]   It's a caliber.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:05.960]   Yeah, caliber.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.040]   Yeah, it's really ugly.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.400]   And yeah, exactly.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.520]   It really is like an ex-terminal app.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.040]   Right.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.400]   Convert it into the--
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.520]   And also, the Kindle app really does demonstrate the need
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.600]   for an app like this.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.720]   Because I've got the Kindle Chrome plugin.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.680]   And I'm surprised at how many times I've got 20 minutes
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.760]   to kill a one-blowing for a phone call.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.920]   And I really want to continue reading a book that I started
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.520]   on my iPad a few days ago.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.160]   And am I going to have to go get my iPad and sit at my desk
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:35.760]   holding my iPad?
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.440]   No, I may as well read it on the desktop.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.720]   So I really hope this is the four app--
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.880]   Long before Apple does iBooks on the desktop.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.240]   I mean, it's got to, right?
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.160]   I don't know if they have to.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.000]   I mean, Apple--
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.120]   If you're going to do textbooks--
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.640]   You would think, and yet they haven't done it yet.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640]   I'm surprised.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.640]   I can understand why tidbits--
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:52.320]   Yeah, give up.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.480]   --have said, look, how--
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   We'll do it.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.520]   And they sell ebooks.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.000]   And they take control series.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.240]   They have tons of them.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.520]   And I'm sure they get the same response that you guys get.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.040]   Yeah, why can't I read this?
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.360]   You can do a PDF or something.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.480]   But this is better to have some--
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.200]   It really does feel like a labor of love.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.320]   Because along with the release notes,
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.680]   Adam was saying that this is not going to change
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.560]   our publishing strategy.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.440]   We're still going to publish our Take Control series as PDFs.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.240]   But we felt as though we want this app to exist.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.760]   We have the ability to get this app built.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.880]   We're sick and tired of waiting.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.720]   Presto.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.160]   Catsey Girl points out that there is an ePub plug-in
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.480]   for Firefox.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:26.960]   Right.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   Right.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.520]   You have to live in the browser.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:29.640]   But you could do it that way.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.240]   That may not be about it.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.360]   My pick is something that's kind of surprised me.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.920]   But I'm excited about.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.960]   iMovie for was pretty impressive when
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.600]   it came out in the iPad 2, $5 for video editing.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.760]   And the iPad 2 turns out touch is not a bad way to edit.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:47.400]   So, Avid, which has long been a competitor on the PC side--
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.480]   And actually, they've made Mac versions as well--
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.600]   for Final Cut, now has Avid Studio for iPad.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.200]   And you know what?
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:55.920]   It's great.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.640]   Same price as iMovie.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.320]   And in my initial playing with it,
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.880]   I would say get it instead of iMovie.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.840]   I don't know if you guys have reviewed it yet or not.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.760]   We did a first look, and that basically is it.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.360]   It does.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.320]   It's great.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.520]   It does everything iMovie does.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:07.960]   And--
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.520]   So let me just show you.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.680]   We'll do more of this on iPad today on Thursday.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.680]   I've been kind of saving it.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.600]   I was going to do a day in the life.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.120]   You can shoot movies, of course, on your iPhone,
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.040]   and then import using the little thing here or whatever.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.120]   But you can also shoot them on the iPad.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.280]   Truth is, I think the iPad camera for video is probably OK.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.400]   It's not HD.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   You'll start by creating a project and importing films
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.920]   into the project.
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.320]   It has the same kind of timeline that iMovie has.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.960]   But it also has a storyboard mode.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.320]   Here's all the clips.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.960]   So you can look at individual clips.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.480]   Then it has the timeline.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.520]   Here's the soundtrack.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.320]   You have multiple soundtracks as well.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.920]   Great transitions, titling.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920]   Now, it's only got two.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.560]   I'm thinking they're going to have a store, an in-app store,
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:56.960]   for additional transitions.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.200]   I mean, these are the simple dissolves
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.200]   that you would want anyway.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.560]   Most people shouldn't be using anything but cuts and dissolves.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.400]   But I have a feeling there's a marketplace for that.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:07.320]   Titling's pretty good, and they have motion titles.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.560]   Something like, I'll show you this.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.920]   So we can go full screen and play it back.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.720]   It does have to render--
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.920]   this is a motion title so it comes in and comes out,
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.800]   but they have other motion titles.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.360]   It does have to render transitions.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.480]   And OK, it's not the best movie ever.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.080]   I'm working on the content side of it.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.920]   But it does have some interesting little Phillips like this.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.600]   And the thing is, touch it turns out is really great.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.000]   There's a Zoom in clip editor so that it's easy to edit trim
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.560]   clips and so forth.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.720]   I'm pretty impressed with it.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.600]   I think this is a very nice first effort from Avid.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.960]   And even at this point, brand new, 1.0,
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.600]   I'd say, if you're going to spend $4.99 on a video editor
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.480]   on the iPad, this is the one to get.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.040]   I'm really impressed.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.480]   I really liked it too.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.360]   And I think this is kind of a landmark app too,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.920]   because I can't think of another app like this
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.520]   where the attitude wasn't that we're
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.280]   going to create a portable version of a desktop app.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.040]   But we're going to take this popular task.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.240]   And we're going to articulate it in a way that specifically
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.480]   makes sense for a mobile touch user.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.120]   This is an app that was designed by people who thought that,
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.720]   if the only computer you have is an iPad,
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:20.160]   you want to kick butt film editor for it.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.680]   And so here is your kick butt standalone film editor
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.440]   where you are never expected to ever take this project back
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.600]   to the best.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.360]   You can do it start to finish on your iPad
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.480]   and why would you want to do it in any other way?
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.280]   Although I do believe that you can export it out and use Avid
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.040]   Studio as well.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.080]   So you aren't stuck.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.080]   But you're right.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.320]   I think that everything you need is actually in here.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:42.880]   It's not like the iOS version of iMovie, which is great.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.440]   But clearly, on that whiteboard when they're designing it,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.640]   they're saying, well, we don't need to do this,
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.240]   because if they want to do that, they'd
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.280]   have the desktop version for doing this.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.360]   It's really sweet.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.600]   I mean, just very nicely done.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.560]   In fact, I would say has most of the features of iMovie
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560]   on the desktop, frankly.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.000]   $4.99.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.120]   It's from Avid.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.040]   It is in the iTunes store right now.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.200]   It's called the Avid Studio.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.360]   And well, I'm glad to hear that you guys agree,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.240]   because I only played with it for an hour or so.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.480]   But I was impressed just with what I saw.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.080]   And I'm actually looking forward to shooting some video
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:17.800]   and editing it.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.800]   It's nice to have them give Apple some competition
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.880]   and push Apple a little bit.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.400]   I just say, well, if it's an iPad app, Apple's going to do it.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.240]   We're not going to buy it.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.800]   I'd say kudos to Apple, which could say, oh, no,
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.760]   there's already an app.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.480]   You don't get to do another app.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.320]   I mean, they've been good about that lately.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.360]   But this is-- there is strong competitor to Apple
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.000]   in the desktop.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.800]   And I think that it's brave of Apple to say, hey, OK,
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.600]   we'll take some competition on the tablet as well.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.800]   I think the fastest way--
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.240]   I'd love to hear your tip on this,
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.760]   and maybe Andy's, too, to get video out of the iPhone
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.680]   and into this is with the camera connection kit.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.520]   You just take the USB cable, hook it up to the iPad,
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   and then just copy it over.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.720]   That's the fastest way.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.560]   There are Wi-Fi apps that allow you to do that.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.160]   But I think it's a little slower and less reliable.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:56.720]   That's definitely slow.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.400]   OK.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.160]   Just thought-- I thought that was the best.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.360]   And see, now you've got such a good camera in here
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.640]   if you have a 4S.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.080]   You can shoot great HD video.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.520]   Although it's all 1080, so it's going to be huge.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.760]   But yeah, it'll look great.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.640]   But it'll look great.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.280]   And imagine.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.680]   I mean, you've got to--
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.280]   in these two devices, you've got a very portable,
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.520]   easy to use film studio.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.880]   Wow.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.240]   All right, hey, I'm so glad you could be here.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:19.600]   Thank you.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.640]   We love having you come in.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.080]   It's great to be here.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:21.600]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.400]   Jason Snell, Macworld Magazine, Macworld.com.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.240]   He's the editor-in-chief.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.240]   That means the big honcho.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.000]   And he is a great fella.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.880]   Good to have you.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.680]   No, I love having you come in.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.440]   Andy, of course, we couldn't do this show without Andy
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.160]   Inako.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.320]   He's the heart, the soul, and the sideburns of this program.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.200]   And we're glad to have you and the entire Action League,
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.480]   or whatever the hell that is.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.360]   They're the Avengers.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.680]   The Avengers.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.320]   The Avengers.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.120]   I'll always say, are they the new Avengers,
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.400]   or are they the secret Avengers?
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:54.800]   Are they the--
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.120]   To me, the Avengers will always be John Steed and Emma
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:58.480]   Peel.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.160]   I don't get it.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:42:59.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.200]   I don't get it.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.520]   That is very true.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.080]   That is a very nice little leotard.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.240]   Those are the catsuit, I think they call it.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.440]   Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:12.520]   and of course, his website, www.cwop.com.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.960]   We do this show on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:21.960]   Time, 1900 UTC at twit.tv.

[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.840]   We love it if you watch live.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.200]   But if you can't, don't forget, we always make audio and video
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.000]   available in a variety of formats on our website, twit.tv.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.960]   The best thing to do would be pick the format you like,
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.680]   subscribe, and you'll get it every time.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.400]   Not miss an episode.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.200]   Alex Lindsay, wherever you are, we miss you.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.320]   What country is he in today?
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.440]   He's in New York last week.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.280]   He's still in New York.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.600]   No, I think Vegas, actually.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.560]   Sorry.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.400]   He has been working his butt off,
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.680]   so he's been very, very busy with the Pixel Core.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.080]   So he'll be back someday.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.040]   Stay tuned.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.200]   Coming up, our twit photo show with Catherine Hall.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.880]   And I'm very excited.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:03.920]   Our photographer is our winner in the twit photo guest quest,
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.240]   a guy just out of college who does amazing pictures.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.600]   Stay tuned for that.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.480]   Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.080]   Now get back to work.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.680]   Break time is over.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.680]   Ah!
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.680]   [LAUGHTER]
