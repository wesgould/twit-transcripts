[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.560]   Hello Renee. I'll pleasure to be back with you all plants
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.320]   You have yes, yes, and I've these are the ones I have not yet killed. I'm very bad with plants
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320]   I'm trying my best. I thought I needed some
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.840]   Organics looks like a rubber tree oops there goes another rubber tree
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.040]   Is that a rubber tree over your left shoulder? I think
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.520]   Georgia Dow help me of course do the planting because she knows things about organics and this yeah, I
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200]   She told me what they were I do not remember what they were so I apologize, but I think rubber sounds familiar
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   And I can't tell what the one over the right shoulder is
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.680]   That's definitely not a rubber tree. I don't know what it is
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.560]   No, I killed young killer. I'll fight this on doing well. You killed a cactus. I think I over watered it
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.960]   Oh, yeah, yeah, and he and I cuz also here he has no plants
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.920]   It's a wise man. Well, please behind me it used to be plants
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.060]   Then I killed them and turned them into something that was useful for my purposes
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.280]   I've always had as humanity was intended to do in God's dominion. I've always wanted a house
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.640]   Lote like filled like a Victorian filled with ferns and plants everywhere
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.920]   I've always wanted that I have to marry a plant keeper
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.520]   Because Lisa also has a brown thumb
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.400]   I I hate to be your zig ziggler or motivational speaker, but I you need to ask yourself Leo
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   What is keeping you yes between yourself? Yes, and your dream of owning ferns. It's true. I think it's you
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.680]   I feel there's a there's a little use there's something wrong with me
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   There's something I flawed deeply flawed in me, but I can't keep a friend alive
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.560]   Yeah, but I think I'm I think I'm on the same page as as Renee
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.840]   It's like when you get the plants are not the first thing you think of when you like move into a new place
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.280]   It's when you start looking at plants or like getting new getting new dishware or a table where that's when you realize that okay
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.800]   If I if I'm getting this picky unit about things I must have completely moved in by now
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   I but I bought I bought I bought a huge set of like William Sonoma dinner where like over the weekend because my for the past
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.720]   15 12 years my dinnerware has been a set of like actual like
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.600]   Insurance salvage like a diner plates and bowls that I bought at building 19
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.200]   Like the insurance salvage store that is no that is no longer and they're beautiful
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.040]   But it's like what if you want to have more than like three people over for dinner
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.160]   And what if you need to convince them that you can afford things and that you acknowledge that perhaps
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   Salvage diner where is not necessarily the fancy eating plates that you you have when they're kissed over so it's so funny
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.120]   Because when you first set up a house you buy you know you go to Creighton barrel or pure one you buy plates
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.180]   but as you
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.360]   Well actually when you first do it salvage then you buy plates when you get a little more sophisticated and then by the time you're really
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.080]   sophisticated you're buying salut you're doing salvage again you go to antique storage Alex Lindsey is also here vintage
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.740]   Yes, Alex is the king of the pixel core Alex Lindsey on the Twitter
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.600]   plants no plants
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   Some plants we have figured out that the best way to eat the plants alive is to put the kids to work
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.440]   So they want to be smart they have it on their on their chores
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.600]   What I really found made a difference was that ball that holds water
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.340]   You know that you put the that's what I feel like you said technological
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.920]   I might my son and I've been talking about we're like for the plants
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.360]   What we really need is a little water and then we need some kind of something that's gonna measure something's gonna measure the
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:12.160]   The moisture and then something that just drives the water so that we're really interested in the idea of actually having plants not interested in
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.560]   The idea of controlling them with a raspberry pie very interested. Here's the raspberry pie pie planter a plant growth monitor
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   With a sensor array, you know our friend more complicated friend Gary
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   runs an entire hydroponic greenhouse with raspberry pies
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.520]   What is he growing in that hydroponic greenhouse? No, no, he's not that he's a he lettuces and okay
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   Yeah, he does the thing where it's aquaponics not hydroponics. He has fish. Oh wow and the there's a whole ecosystem
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:50.120]   Right school. I think it's school grown. Let me see if I can get it right and Gary's watching I know because he's a he's a big fan
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah school grown aquaponics at school grown org and he has we should get him in some time to show
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.680]   How he's used all of these technologies including raspberry pie to keep these things going so he grows lettuces
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.240]   But there's fish underneath and then there's the fertilizer
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.020]   Underneath the fish. I don't know the fish make the fertilizer the things do the thing you just need
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.600]   Oh, you need a laser with an eye with some AI so that guy it can
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.400]   See the difference through the B and the mosquito and it just zaps the big zap zap zap zap zap zap zap. The big look at these beautiful lettuces
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.540]   Man, so they call it school grown because they the initial market really is
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.280]   Schools where they want kids to learn this whole cycle of things, you know be really cool if we could grow cupcakes
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:44.160]   Cupcakes would be awesome. We see cupcakes. Yeah, I want aquaponics. We grew some cupcakes for Alex Lindsay
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   It was birthday and I've been stalling
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:54.480]   Stalling until the cupcakes got back stalling happy birthday to you happy birthday to you
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.920]   That's your Alex
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   Happy birthday
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.720]   Okay, you can end it with a Donna Domiro high-sea
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.920]   Andy Naco
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   Oh
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:22.120]   I think that's the highest quality birthday song I've ever had sung to me. That's what I've ever said to Tanner to do a baritone's job
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   Basel Profondo, so I'm doing pretty well for 74. Yeah, you look great, man

[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   Yeah, exactly
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.760]   I don't understand why people say that they make their age lower because I feel like if you make it higher
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.120]   Well goes why you're doing so well, you may find out like what happened to you man our sponsor today is Tris Pontus coffee

[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.760]   You picked it yes, and you said it's better and it's great and I downloaded it
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.140]   Re downloaded it and got back into it and I'm once again hooked they really did improve it quite a bad
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.880]   It's so many things yeah every they try to do it an update every three months and they just I mean the summer one was the
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   Alola it just keeps going
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.620]   Lee oh they had
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.940]   Friendship was the biggest one and then before that it was field research and before that it was raised and then you gems
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.460]   That's dumb and it keeps sucking me back in every time I finish that I say I'm done and then they do something else
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.840]   I'm more comm slash Pokemon - go
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.420]   We'll give you everything you need to know
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.840]   We made a hug we actually broke down in
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:48.460]   This is great the summer survival guy did you get a blast voice I did I met we was this
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.240]   So we were a community day we got all the squirtles we got all the shiny squirtles all the sunglasses squirtles and all the
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.140]   Chinese sunglasses squirtles you're so good at this then we went for ice cream like all pros do so every month they do this
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.980]   Which is kind of cool it's a community day and they started doing a raid day and it's a little bit much because your whole weekend gets taken up
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.440]   But they have like a raid day on the Saturday than a community day on the Sunday and each of them are three hours
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.160]   And I don't know I was at a Japanese restaurant with my daughter yesterday
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.020]   And I just quickly was you know just spinning the gyms and the waitress said oh did you get a blast ice?
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:28.220]   And I said do you play she said no my husband and son play non-stop, so I know all about squirtle day
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   I'm trying to keep my kids away from it. Just keep them in the same. It's pretty addictive
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:40.880]   Ready to be you guys worried that like just just like like the fish stocks outside in Nova Scotia that you're gonna be overfished for
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.080]   Pokemon and the you're not allowing them to like to rebuild their their sort of their sort of population
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.400]   It's so fast and eat it beats so fast and there's so many overfished, but here's a question for Renee
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.200]   Yes, sir, Lisa and I are fighting over this. This is how bad it's gotten
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.920]   Well, I want to take five. I don't know if I can't get worse getting there and I'm getting you know
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   There's a squirtle and I'm I'm shooting for it. She says don't get it if you get it
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.440]   I can't get it. I said no no whether I get it has nothing to do with whether you get it
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:14.360]   Well, who's right? But what yeah, you they're unlimited so you can catch as many you both can catch the same matter if I catch
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:20.520]   Pokemon in my air will work together. Yeah, she could get it. It doesn't everyone gets their own unique copy of it
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   Yeah, what if we combined?
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:31.040]   Cryptocurrency with Pokemon so there it was it would get it would get slowly more difficult to to get ahold of these
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.440]   This could be proof of work and then you could sell your Pokemon call it proof of $1,000 per Pokemon
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.600]   Oh, though they have been trading now so you could blockchain the trades to prove the offense
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.200]   You could you could watch it and make it and make it slowly come become more and more
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.120]   Each Pokemon character you see crypto kitties having you that's the that's crypto kitties collectible breedable adorable
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.240]   The thing is that these there are people paying a hundred thousand dollars for these digital cats
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.480]   Wow, you can breed them and then you get a unique kind
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   Man, I'm I know the wrong line of work. Yeah, and it but it wasn't dollars. It was the you know the crypto kitty coin
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.040]   Network is slow right now. So I guess I
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.320]   Have not seen that many people that are that gullible
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:22.840]   I've not seen a better formed plan for getting people to trade actual money for fake money
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:31.000]   Since like the early 1990s and when I was buying a hundred copies of X-Men number one with Jim Lee and those people that's
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.560]   Secret Wars - number one Andy I fell for that hard. Here's a guy
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.920]   He's the total sales on the crypto kitties platform $12 million
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:49.320]   Some cats sold for upwards of $80,000. There is a guy who's taught a 30 year old entrepreneur and software designer
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.200]   he's the owner of 35 crypto kitties and
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.800]   He's made more money in crypto kitties than he did as in his investments
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.520]   His big break came when he purchased an old lace cat for 12 ether that was $4,800 at the time of purchase later
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   So the value of the cat arise to 30 ether
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.500]   So he's a rich rich man so much it just feels like a Ponzi scheme
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:18.620]   It's like one Ponzi scheme after another and as long as you get in early money on the first Ponzi
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.380]   At least there's some dignity and saying I lost
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:29.280]   $130,000 investing in a differential fund that was attached to the GNP
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   At least they say people those are stuff people don't understand and okay could it could it work?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.680]   It's like well, I bought a top hat
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.040]   fuzzy
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.360]   Gerbil and the fuzzy Gerbil was supposed to germinate into the wedding veil Gerbil
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.560]   And I would have doubled my money, but I lost $130,000 on the
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.280]   speculating on a wedding veil Gerbil and you feel you look you feel silly because you are being silly and
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.440]   People I just have my house because I'm a silly. I'm about a kitty. No real kitty
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.880]   No, the Joe kitty. Can you pet it? No, so the rumor going around
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.160]   Fast and hot and furious today may be debunked by the time you hear this
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.400]   Exclusive this is boy genius report apple to deploy one password, which is a password vault system very good one to all
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.080]   123,000 employees
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.760]   Acquisition talks underway now acquisition talks part has been debunked. That's been debunked. Yes. I wanted to say that
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.560]   So how was it debunked Apple said no no no no at one password said no no we are we are staying put we love our human owners
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   We're not going anywhere right
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.960]   We don't we don't need the overlords. However a great deal for one password a
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.280]   Big big deal for one password to get a hundred twenty three thousand plus users
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.320]   It was a lot of confusion because Apple has iCloud keychain which with iOS 12 becomes a full password manager because you have everything from
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.720]   A master quote-unquote master password with face ID or touch ID plus you have all the auto fill stuff
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   You have the automatic generation of strong long passwords strong story strong unique passwords. So it is a good starting
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.400]   System and they're like why would Apple want a license one password?
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.720]   But I think what they get out of this it's similar to their use of slack or other small team tools is that they'll have the ability to
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.560]   Collaborate and share passwords across that's exactly different employees which iCloud keychain doesn't provide. That's exactly right
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.240]   I can't change the fine personal choice, but it is not a good enterprise choice and
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.520]   Other contractors are on iOS or Mac OS either so makes sense and and the
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.080]   One of the big advantages when you're working at an enterprise level is being able to give people passwords they can log into a
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.560]   Location but not actually have the password
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.280]   The left fewer number of people that have it the better
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   It's not just that you're able to share passwords, but you're able to keep them locked out when they start when they cease to be a
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.520]   Employee you simply turn it off and they lost access to all those sites. Yeah
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.920]   We of course our
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.400]   Advertiser is a last pass which is a direct competitor one password, but we
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.360]   It's absolutely the case that you want to use as we do here at last pass enterprise
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.760]   But you want to use an enterprise version there and one password as an enterprise version as well
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:09.280]   Yeah, yeah, and what I was just yeah, and this does I don't know if the like the what's the built-in so far does it do?
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.800]   Generation of passwords. I was 12 it does strong generation
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:20.480]   You know I have to say I'm really impressed with the iOS 12 on it because what happens is it says you want me to generate a password shows
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.720]   You a human readable nice human readable password and it automatically saves it and it saves it to the keychain right?
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   So it's available now on Mac as well
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.680]   Yeah, all of your device all your Apple devices
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.720]   It's not good if you have if you have Android phones or Windows phones or Linux
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.880]   Then you want to use last password - later one password because their cross platform like a keychain very much is not
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:43.040]   But if you're all in on the Apple ecosystem and you just want a basic password manager with iOS 12
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.440]   It is really a good quality very convenient very secure one and it's it's on track
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.240]   I mean, it's it's it's automatically on you just get it whenever you so I think that's really good because
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.800]   you know
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:04.160]   We've been talking a lot about this lately Megan and I earlier were talking a lot about there's normal users and there's us and
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   And while you know you can tell somebody oh you have to have a password fault
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.760]   That's that's a whole different thing from just making it just pop up and an order of magnitude and complex and the nice thing about this is that
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   Previously it was fine if you used websites, but the minute you went to an app you had to leave the app go to your password manager authenticate
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.880]   Copy the password go back and they all try to make it as easy as possible
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.040]   But with iOS 12 Apple will also autofill anything from my cloud keychain into apps as well as websites
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.360]   And they now have an password manager API
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.960]   Which means if you do use last pass or dash lane or one password or any of these tools
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.520]   They can and they've all said they're doing it
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.040]   They're going to make it so that you can autofill with your chosen password manager instead
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.240]   Which is nice because sometimes the proprietary solution gets special benefits that the competing third parties
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.880]   Don't but in this case apple really wanted to emphasize the security
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   So no matter what you choose you can do you can't do apps on Mac OS because there's a level of openness and apps
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.960]   It's different than iOS, but in all your iOS devices you can autofill right into apps the same way as websites
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.240]   Here's the tweet from agile bits on their one password account rumors of my acquisition are completely false
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.400]   My humans and I are happily independent plan to remain so I should point out that
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   There could very well be negotiations going on
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.800]   And one of the obligations often in these negotiations is not to say anything deny everything
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.760]   It's deny everything and they're often are penalties significant penalties if you don't know that's that well
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.600]   The difference there is that usually your solution is to not say any if not to you don't you wouldn't align necessarily
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.920]   Yeah, you're kind of sticking your neck out there
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.640]   I will say that because that was tweeted by the piece of software
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.200]   One password could have been programmed
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   The
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   AI
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.320]   Has apple does apple mentioned I think they do one password they've mentioned them in keynote, haven't they?
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.600]   Yeah, I think so
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.760]   Yeah, I mean I think that they are the kind of the quote-unquote apple favorite after last pass was bought by log me in
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.640]   It was just it's a different just different cult, you know, I have to say
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.200]   It's kind of like they have a like a big indie heart and one and one password to be in my experience to be fair
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.120]   Really works great on apple stuff is less good on yeah, I mean that's and that's why we chose last pass
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.840]   Yeah, last pass is kind of a better cross platform in my opinion again. They're a sponsor
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.200]   Uh, but what one if you were only using max and and uh, ios one password is beautiful
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.080]   It is a beautiful job integrating it works very well on android as well. It supports fingerprint recognition
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.960]   It supports a lot of autofill stuff. It has a couple of tricks
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.600]   I think that it can get away with because it's on android that uh, the ios in support
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.400]   So yeah, I agree on windows. Yeah, you know, you need you need something else to go with but it's a
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.200]   I've actually standard on one one password myself even though I really even though i'm
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   I have a lot more windows stuff in the in the office over the past year than I used to
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.240]   And I keep meaning to go to last pass, but I just like one password too much
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.080]   It's this is kind of like what you're what you're indicating that there's some companies that they're not just really really good
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.760]   Mac and ios developers. It seems like they've got six color blood, you know, like the like omnigroop
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.320]   Like omnigroup. There are six color company and one password is also a six color company bb
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.720]   Barebones is a six color company. They're part of the tapestry of apple
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:19.920]   And so there's just something about them that you kind of like agile bits is very much you always get the feeling they're very much an apple house, right?
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.240]   Yeah, um, did they do anything else for some reason? I feel like there's other software that was at no, I mean
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.240]   They I think they always intended to and they just went it's like there's a lot of companies who your product becomes so
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   Successfully becomes anonymous with you with the product rather than I think very few people know agile bits, but a lot of people know
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.360]   Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's a good that notice that they tweeted from the one password account
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.240]   Yeah, if they tweet from the agile bits again, everybody would say
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.080]   The other thing that's nice about all this built into ios 12 as well
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.840]   It'll start flagging duplicate passwords for you, which a lot of the big password managers do
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.120]   But a lot of people just don't even think about that and they have there like there was a time-hop breach for example this week
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.480]   And when a company is breached that if you use the same password across many sites
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.400]   One of the first things hackers do is try the same password on a bunch of important websites huge issue
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   So highlighting that you've got a repeating password and then offering
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.760]   They make it super easy to go to the pay the website or the app and change your password
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.160]   It's a they really emphasis is on unique passwords now, but that's not a human solution
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.000]   So when I'm trying as an admin as an admin, I believe you can require that too
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.280]   You can say you can't have you can push
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.400]   Yeah
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.960]   When you're using the team
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.560]   Stuff that that is one of the reasons you want to use an enterprise version is you can have all sorts of requirements
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.720]   You could say we have to change the password every three months
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.080]   We have to you know, you have to use two factor
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.960]   You can't reuse a password and I know all of those things are huge for teams and also for last pass
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.520]   We know we we have it log out every time I log in somewhere else
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.680]   Yep, which is a little annoying when you're trying to do it quickly
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.480]   But it's it it just means that I always know that there's only open on the device that I'm using today
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.320]   It's there is a I have to say there's a race between one password and last pass dash lanes kind of secondarily
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.520]   uh for features and and capabilities and
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.760]   Security and that is great. Yeah, that is great. I did by the way. We should mention that time hop thing
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.240]   I hadn't used it, but I had used it for a long time
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.440]   uh
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:21.280]   And time hopped at one point had access to all my accounts because the whole idea of time hop is it would say here's what you're doing
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.880]   A year ago two years ago five years ago, and so I gave it instagram facebook twitter everything right
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.920]   Uh, so that breach was potentially significant
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.080]   I went immediately to my time hop account and couldn't log in because it used a facebook log in
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.960]   Which I have I don't have so I don't know how to fix this but they did say at time hop said
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.960]   We've deactivated all those tokens so anything that you added as a uh as an input for time hop
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.280]   You'll have to re-add because of this breach, but that's a significant breach
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.360]   You know there was polar this week as well with the heart rate monitor disclosure
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.400]   Yeah, and I have to apologize because Megan and I kind of got into it on polar
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.320]   uh
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.560]   The debate first of all polar did screw up because their api allowed
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   Anybody to see because they have serial
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.240]   sequential serial
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:18.000]   Uh identifiers for every user and their api allowed you to just go through the web and sequentially go through every user
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.720]   So even if a user was private the location information from their run
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.520]   Would be polar is a heart rate monitor and the pro flow app is used to track your runs
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.640]   So even if they had said it to private that information was exposed so that's absolutely a leak
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.960]   But Megan and I were going back and forth on the issue which was raised by zdnet and and others
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.920]   And this is the same issue with strava that secret
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.880]   Secret facilities could be identified because you can see
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.960]   There were a lot of military folks doing labs around nothing
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.520]   That was the problem with strava and then secondarily uh and they were able to demonstrate this
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.160]   There was a Dutch newspaper that discovered the flaw uh, you could find an nsa employee
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.840]   Note that he was at the nsa doing stuff at the nsa and then note where his home was
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.440]   You could actually figure out what his home address is that's a huge issue
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.120]   I have to admit there's a little bit of an intelligence test there of having something that tracks your location working at an intelligence
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.160]   Is that's very poor
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.000]   That's like yeah, yeah, not not good
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.560]   Uh craft yeah, so if a spy is doing that
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.960]   Uh, you know, I don't think you can blame polar for that
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.000]   But at the same time you can blame polar because I mean everything's wrong
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.320]   One of those situations where you can have a breach and you can not be using the equipment that can breach
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.600]   Yeah, but it's always it's but the funny thing it reminds me of my my funniest
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.560]   My best best story I ever heard
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:57.440]   About inference based on data where supposedly the uh the the soviet's used to think that there was a really really important command bunker
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.800]   In the middle of the pentagon like in the middle of the courtyard because they had subtle it wasn't because of fitness track
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.120]   It was because they could see that like their
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.680]   High level top level people going in and out of there and only at certain times of the day
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.000]   They thought this must be where they're getting let me guess
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.920]   It was it was actually a hot dog stand. Yeah
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.200]   They're getting a hot dog briefing next
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.280]   There was was there a snack truck story during the Gulf War that was very similar. I thought that was like it
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.960]   And it was really just a snack truck. However, you know uh two things if you're uh a spy
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.160]   If you're working at the NSA, you probably shouldn't be wearing a fitness tracker
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.520]   No, or maybe even carrying an insecure cell phone
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.800]   No, and you certainly shouldn't take our location. Sure. Well the president that's different. He's the president. He can do whatever he wants
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.440]   Uh obviously
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.520]   It agrees with you. Yes. Um his his his whereabouts are published
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.280]   You know the press you get that little one thing that says this is where he's gonna be
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.760]   Now in like the minute. Yeah
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.360]   Uh
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.680]   But if you are a spy you probably should be a little more cautious than that and at the same time
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.000]   Yes, polar definitely screwed up with their api
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.880]   Uh because you know at this point there have been so many breaches just this week there were five
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.320]   It feels like well, I don't even want to report on them anymore
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.640]   But I guess we should because like time lost that could be significant if you if there was kind of a funny one today too
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.240]   About apples new usb disabled mode. Oh, let's talk about well
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   Let's take a break and then I do want to talk about that because that's new in 11.4.1, right? Yes
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.520]   and uh
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.160]   Of course immediately uh somebody said what I lcom soft which sells
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.320]   Hardware that this is supposed to disable said oh no we can get around that with a simple usb dongle
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.080]   Let's talk about that in just a second
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.800]   But first let's talk about brushing your teeth. I know I know you don't want to talk about brushing your teeth
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   You do brush your teeth, don't you? Yeah
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   Um
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.320]   If not, I don't want to hang out with you, but I want to tell you about a new way to brush your teeth. It's really great
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   You know that dentists
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.880]   Uh really recommend these new uh electric toothbrushes
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.160]   Absolutely the best dentists recommended, but I've got the best electric toothbrush out there
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's got it. It's just it's it's kind of second generation sensible. It's the quip q u i p
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.600]   It turns out that most of us are not brushing our teeth, right? You're not doing long enough
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.680]   You're not changing your brush head often enough
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.600]   Uh and maybe you're doing it by hand. I've been using an electric toothbrush for so long
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   I forgot how to brush manually
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.480]   I
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.240]   We were on a trip and I didn't have an electric toothbrush and Lisa and I both are going
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   What do you do with how you
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.680]   Your wrist we couldn't figure it out because we're so used to this but this is our electric toothbrush. Look at this
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.240]   Looks just like a regular toothbrush. It's tiny
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.440]   When you travel it's so great you travel with it. It has comes in a nice little test tube
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.240]   Uh, it doesn't have a charger. You don't have to bring that along. It's powered by a battery
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.880]   One triple a battery and that goes for months
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   So it's a perfect travel toothbrush
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.360]   It's also great at home because it has a little
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.040]   Uh docking
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.000]   Little holder that has an adhesive on the back you put it right on your mirror
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.960]   You'll never forget to brush because it's right there. You're looking right at it
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.000]   It mounts to your mirror suctiones to your mirror unsticks to use as a cover for hygienic travel
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.240]   Wherever you take your teeth
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.720]   And I do hope you take your teeth on vacation when you go
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.880]   Everyone loves quip

[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   All right
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.880]   In the latest version of iOS which came out what this week Renee recently yes yesterday
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.640]   Yeah
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.920]   um
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   There's a new feature that if you don't unlock the phone for an hour
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.040]   It disables you data access via the lighting port is that correct is that how to say it?
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.120]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.960]   Immediately alcom soft which is a company that makes the hardware that this is to block
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   There are a number of companies celebrates another one the israeli company police buy these boxes that they can connect up
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.360]   Uh, they try to unlock your phone, but they can also download the data off of your phone
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.080]   They can suck the data out of it and that's exactly I believe what apple's trying to defeat here, right?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.520]   Yeah
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.000]   Alcom soft says oh no we can still do it of course remember they're trying to sell the product
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.880]   That lets him do it. What's the story there?
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.040]   So this is uh
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   This is what they put up was that if you so apple has this very clearly on their web page
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.960]   They describe what the feature does and the feature will after an hour if everyone has been locked
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.920]   As sorry hasn't been unlocked for an hour. It will shut down access via the lightning port the lightning usb
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Us uh sorry usb port and they call us usb restricted mode
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.520]   Yeah, uh and a design so that if you then go and try and plug in a usb device
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.120]   You'll have to unlock the iphone in order to iphone or ipad in order to use it
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.160]   And it's designed to be exactly what you said that kind of security feature
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.080]   But apple also built in a few exceptions. So for example if you use an accessibility
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.680]   Excessory in order to enter your passcode having it lock you out
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.400]   Would create an endless loop of despair and frustration
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.120]   So by default when you plug one of those in it will let you use it to enter the passcode
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.080]   You can turn that off in settings. You can turn it on in settings as well
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.560]   You can choose to allow that there are a couple other accessories like they use the camera kit
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:56.800]   Which is designed for you to transfer your photos and apple prevents it from locking you down because maybe your transfer isn't finished yet
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.000]   Um, and they immediately called it a bug. It's not a bug. It's as designed and you can argue with that decision
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.760]   You could say it should be more secure
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.720]   It should default to everything off and you should have to go tell it to turn on
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.880]   Or you could argue that it should be even more convenient that there should be a feature that you choose to enable and it's never on until you enable it
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.640]   Or you can choose a balance, which is what apple did which is most accessories are locked off
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.600]   But there are certain accessibility and persistent data transfer accessories that they leave on by default
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.720]   So if the if the iPhone is unlocked and they plug in one of these accessories, it will stay unlocked
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:33.360]   So they're saying oh as soon as you grab the phone plug in the accessory plug it into a battery put it into a faraday bag
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   And then you know, that's it you're fine
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.800]   But um once it's locked what if so if the once it's locked it's still locked it still doesn't work
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.680]   Yes, okay, so this works in a very specific situation. The phone is currently unlocked
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.920]   Yes, you plug in this camera connection kit and start sucking it out and then why the faraday bag so that
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.000]   No one can remotely erase the phone. Ah because you've got the phone
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.800]   Yeah
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.080]   So you want to make sure that the uh, you know the erase still works if the phone's on and connected to the internet
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.240]   So you want to make sure it's disconnected from the internet
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.160]   Yeah, so yeah, so I mean this is what they said is true the way they decided to tell the story
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.680]   I have issues with because it's again
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.200]   It's attention getting sensationalism ahead like for this story
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   What they should have done is looked at the behavior
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.000]   Contacted apples that is this a bug if it's a bug, you know
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.240]   We'll work with you to disclose it if it's not a bug
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.400]   Will then you can disclose it immediately and just argue with them that it's not good behavior
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   That's fine. You can disagree with that behavior
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.200]   But the way it was presented to me was very um
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:40.400]   It seems unlikely that apple would change this too because uh, you don't want it to stop the camera connection kit to stop working
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.440]   10 minutes in because the phone locked itself
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.320]   Yeah, like people will be frustrated. I mean that's the thing like security and convenience as Steve Gibson always says they're content
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.520]   They're they're contentious
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.600]   They're at war and some people want you to fail secure and some people want you to fail safe
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.720]   And these are mainstream products and you've got a you've got to pick your battles
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.760]   And maybe they will change it or maybe they'll the first time you plug it in they'll say do you want to do you want to you want to
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.200]   To let the accessory keep your iPhone unlocked, you know, maybe they'll give you a choice that introduces complexity
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.160]   But right now as a design this is this is the way it's supposed to be a good question for the chair room from out of sync
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.360]   Why the one hour wait to lock the port shouldn't the port just be locked the minute the usb
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.880]   I mean the usb the lightning port be locked the minute the
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.640]   Phone locks again. So again, it's it's a battle for convenience
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.000]   If you just lock your phone you go and plug it in and you come back eight hours later and it's not charged
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.600]   You'll be mad. Oh, so it won't even charge that it's not really
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   There are some accessories that will not charge if you are not unlocked because there's some of them are combination data
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.280]   Okay, um
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.760]   It's part there are some dumb ports that will just charge no matter anything
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.400]   But like an end user should never have to worry about things like that
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.840]   You should just like you're expected behavior as I plug it in there for it will charge
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:55.200]   And for most people simple things like that are way more common occurrences than some foreign entities seizing your iphone and trying to brute force their way into it
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.280]   So it needs to be
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.120]   unlocked when you plug the usb in
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.480]   In that i believe so and you can also choose if you put it in sos mode it locks immediately
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   So if you're ever worried about your phone, you just crawl down the two side buttons
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.080]   It goes into sos mode and then it is it is back in preboard you are your keys are thrown away
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.320]   You have to authenticate to get back in you can't use facelide you touch id you can't plug it into usb
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.720]   Nothing do that whenever you want
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.440]   So because that that's the curiosity like because it seems like it should
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:29.200]   Once it's been locked if you plug it in it could only take it seems like it should just to only take power
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.200]   It
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.920]   Depends on the accessory there are some accessories that it will still take power from but some people have accessories that do multiple things
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.360]   Like they plug it into their computer and even though the little pop-up dialogue comes up
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.520]   It says do you want to trust this computer you may be ignoring that because you just plugged it in and went to bed or something
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.040]   It's just again. I would argue I would like it to be more secure
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.200]   I would like them to err more on the side of security
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.400]   But I feel like i'm a power user who understands those things and maybe I'd take a lot of explanation to get people
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.800]   To figure out those behavioral patterns
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.760]   I was talking about scooter x just put posted in the irc
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   You know in other words once the police officer sees is the iphone he or she
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.600]   Uh would need to immediately connect the iphone if it's unlocked if it's unlocked
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.400]   Never or if it had been unlocked in the last
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.640]   Our phone but that's right now. That's what i'm saying is it?
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   Yeah, it does. I think that I think that the I do think that once it's locked
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   um
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.880]   Uh, you can't plug something in that would extend that hour except for power
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.080]   There I said from a security perspective, accessibility device
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.640]   Like accessibility device is designed to let you enter your passcode and you can't use it because your passcode isn't entered
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.880]   So they have to build in some
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.720]   I just feel like if I want to use an accessibility device. I unlock my phone. I plug it in
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.480]   And then oh because no the accessibility device is how you unlike the phone
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.640]   But I but I guess I would I would say is that they should there should be an another like a
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.160]   Very secure mode. There is a toggle you can turn that I believe you can turn that off in settings
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.960]   Right, but i'm saying like so for that so that basically it is like if it's if it's locked there's no way
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   If it's locked there's no way to plug anything into extend that time frame
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.400]   I do think that that should be the I think that that is in settings
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.120]   I'm double checking now
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.840]   But I believe it's off by default because they want to be able to plug it in and then get the pop up that would tell them
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.280]   Is this stuff in the security settings where where is it? It's in the face ID and uh face ID
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.840]   Face ID settings. Yeah, okay
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.640]   Um, yeah, I think it would be nice if there were a like super secure
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.560]   Like uh, you know, I don't have any accessibility
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.080]   Devices so I would like to really lock this sucker down
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.520]   But I also understand is mine is off by default. Yeah
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.280]   Okay
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.560]   Once us this is elkom stuff once usb restricted mode is engaged in a device no data communications
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.120]   occur over the lightning port
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.920]   A connected computer accessory will not detect a smart device
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.680]   If anything an iPhone and usb restricted mode acts as a dumb battery pack it can be charged
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.840]   But it cannot be identified as a smart device and as you point out rene some
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.440]   Chargers have to see it as more than just a dumb battery pack
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.240]   This effectively blocks for and this is why you do this this blocks forensic tools
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.920]   Like those made by elkom saw from being able to crack passcodes
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:18.320]   If the phone is more than one hour unlocked one hour locked gray shift celebrates
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.600]   Tools these are the ones that apples really worried about and the article is weird because they talk about trusted
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.640]   There's no they talk about untrusted and trusted accessories and there's no such thing
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.680]   There's trusted and untrusted devices because you don't want computers or similar things to do data extraction
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.560]   But there's no such thing as a trusted or untrusted accessory
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.920]   Not in this contest
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:41.120]   We perform several tests as elkom soft actually in a way this this blog post is is reassuring
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.880]   And you can now confirm that usb restricted mode is maintained through reboots
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   and persists
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.560]   Through software restores via recovery mode in in other words
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.400]   We found no obvious way to break usb restricted mode and this is the key once it is already engaged
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.640]   So the heck they're talking about keeps it from being engaged
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.200]   We discovered a workaround which works exactly as we suggested back in may
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.320]   So it isn't a bug
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.480]   It still sounds like if if the police I mean if the police are trained and let's say that there is a terrorist that they shoot no because
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.320]   They got a seized advice take it to a lab then get a search warrant
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.240]   Well, so they're suggesting that the police will immediately plug in a camera kit as part
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.080]   We'll plug in a camera kit a battery pack just to keep it on line and then take it yet
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.440]   Also technically if they killed the guy, uh, they don't need to get a search warrant. Okay
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.480]   Uh, yeah, he did have no privacy rights
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   If they killed the guy they could just face ID or touch ID it anyway right away in other words
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.000]   Once the police says it comes off
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.400]   Once they do it if it if it could they do if it was face ID would it work if they were dead?
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   I mean, I looked at one have attention
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.480]   I have a talk opener. I I have a
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.320]   I've actually I've got a
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.360]   Felix go ahead to talk to some people who deal with dead people
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.640]   Uh, and they say they have not tested face ID
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.880]   However, the markers that face ID typically uses should work
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.840]   Given what they were telling me about what the what the skin does
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.840]   I was actually I was actually looking for the question that that you brought up
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:18.240]   Uh, like again, so what if someone could you tell what are what are the what are the goalposts?
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.560]   You need to fulfill in order to make touch ID work on a dead body
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.000]   And they were saying minimal handling of the body. They might have to warm and moisten moisturize the finger
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.920]   Uh, if the body has been embalmed already, that's going to be a problem
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.600]   Uh, so they want to get at a fresh corpse really. Yes
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.000]   There's no, uh, uh, uh, thermal measurement, right?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.360]   Doesn't check to see if the skin's warm. I thought it does. You need electricity. I mean there's for the capacity
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.640]   For the finger. What about the face ID? Does it measure?
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.800]   That does not it's only measures depth
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.440]   But not firm not heat. Yeah
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.800]   Yeah, I mean there were cases too like there was a plane last year that was forced to land because a guy fell asleep
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.600]   Uh, his wife put his finger on touch that he unlocked his phone saw a bunch of stuff. She didn't like him and it was a ruckus
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.000]   so I mean
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.040]   All of this stuff has, uh, edge cases. So that's why I always give my wife, uh, finger fingerprint access to my phone
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:19.600]   In fact, I'm glad I was 12 will allow oh, but it doesn't allow me it'll allow it allows me to have additional faces, but not somebody else's
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.920]   Yeah, yeah an additional appearance, but on our original face. So I have to give her the password. Yeah
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.120]   That's what in addition to as we're having all these discussions as apple continues to refine
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.840]   Ways of locking down the lockdowns. I've we continue we need to continue to contemplate different scenarios in which
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:41.840]   You just want to make sure that you're that you're using unusually high security for certain situations
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:47.280]   and pretty much free as you go for others like I really wish it were possible to
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:54.560]   In settings select a time period for panic mode like if I'm a if uh, uh
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.680]   Like how long must I hold down the power button to power down the machine?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.800]   How long is it going to wait to make sure actually intend this how long should I hold it hold a button down in order to
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.640]   Turn off touch ID because it's hard
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.760]   It's it's gonna be hard to like you know to be be in the driver's seat of the car and saying yes here
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:22.080]   Let me give you my phone right now. It's gonna take me another 8.1 seconds to get from the drivers side here to the window
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.560]   But there you go now take it. So it's it's it's weird that five years ago when we were contemplating
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.240]   Ideas of touch ID it used to be things like I just don't want someone to be guessing my password
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.000]   Well, I'm uh, well, I'm walked walk away from uh from from a dinner table
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.080]   Now it's like I want to make sure that if I have to go through customs that my
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.960]   That there's not going to be a
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.880]   A someone who has armed with some sort of authority to look through my phone
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.240]   And I want had the ability to shut that down if I want to like do you imagine five years ago?
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.040]   We were thinking about the the vulnerability not to snoopers but to the government into law enforcement
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.000]   Yeah
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.720]   And you keep in mind the FBI is still on apple's case
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.920]   About every single technique they do to make sure make it harder for them
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:14.720]   To get into a phone even with paperwork. So I do want to reiterate what phil zimmerman creator pgp
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.120]   privacy expert creator of black phone silent circle told me he said
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.320]   There is no question they call it zimmerman's law. There is no question in his mind that
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.880]   Technology has made surveillance
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:33.360]   Infinitely easier for law enforcement that they see a lot more than they ever have seen before there's cameras everywhere
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:42.080]   There's we all carry devices with microphones on a person. I mean we're patient trackers. We're just basically walking bugs
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.240]   Uh, he said what it is is there's no question. That's they're of going dark. They're not going dark
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.520]   They seem more than ever before he said what it really is is they have this beautiful hd
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.960]   Screen that they could see everything. There's a few pixels that are black and they don't like black
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   pixels because they want to see everything and that's the phone and
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.320]   There should be black pixels. There should be encryption
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.800]   You guys can you got plenty. I mean, it's the closest thing we have to cybernetics
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.760]   It's it's not it's not a vague issue
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.440]   It really is just like you know 230 some odd years ago
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.720]   Uh people who decided the big list of really important rules for the united states decided that
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.280]   Uh free speech was really really important
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.560]   Uh the ability to not incriminate yourself not testify against yourself was important
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.640]   So they decided to write those things down
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.920]   Now we're dealing with a whole bunch of situations like do we have the fundamental right to keep a secret from the government?
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.480]   And that translates into the fight to make sure that private individuals have the right to encrypt
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:46.720]   Uh their data, uh, and that again wasn't discussed 235 years ago, but we're looking for a specific
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.080]   Uh, we're looking at the fbi the law enforcement
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.360]   They're not bad people remember, but I think that when they and when they are making these complaints
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.800]   They're not talking about seizing someone's phone taking it back to a squad car and trying to dump as much data as possible
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.200]   They're usually talking when they're talking about like the 7 000
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.440]   Devices that they couldn't get into they're talking about 7 000 devices that they tried to get into
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.520]   After going to the courts after getting the right warrant after getting all the paperwork
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.000]   But they still just technically could not get into this sort of thing
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.360]   They're want to create the legal precedent that law enforcement does have the right to enter
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.040]   A private the private property of your phone with a proper warrant
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:29.600]   Uh, where and we came really really close to five four decision just in the supreme court just a couple two or three weeks ago
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.920]   upholding that cell tower data
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.800]   Location data that's being collected from a phone
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.960]   Wood does come does is protected by the fourth amendment
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.840]   Doesn't matter if uh if they have the right paperwork for it
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.400]   The citizen is not required to
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:53.280]   To maintain this phone as a tracking device. They have to they have to have a higher level of of probable cause in order to get that information from a phone carrier
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.560]   And once once again, that was a decision that had to be made that was not
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:04.160]   Something that simply was was born into a human dna and that's that's why anytime someone new comes on the supreme court
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.120]   That's when you have to start thinking about
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.800]   Are we still going to have the right to have a secret from the government in the future?
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.680]   Are they still going to have to be able to be required to show probable cause before getting this evidence?
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.240]   Or are they simply are they going to be held to a lower standard where they don't have to give all this evidence to say here is why exactly
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.720]   We want to get access to this data collected from this phone from this person on this date
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.280]   So it's really going to be difficult and it's the reason why everyone who's interested in technology
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.040]   Should also be interested now in the law and in tech policy. I think that
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.680]   what i was gonna say i think that uh
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.200]   When we when we look at contracts when we're working on contracts with with the other companies
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.160]   We don't assume that it's the people that we're talking to that we're trying to write the contract with because we like them and we're in
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.880]   In a business because we think that they're good people
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.160]   We're like if the worst person in the world got a hold of this contract from the other side like bought their company and took it over
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.760]   What could they do with this contract?
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.600]   You know that is what we want to know
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.880]   And in the same case, you know, we of course we say well the country the government is always looking out for our best interests
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.960]   And it's doing the good thing
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.600]   We have to look at, you know, I I think that when we think about what the government should be doing and shouldn't be doing
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.040]   We should look back into 30s Germany and 40s Germany and make a decision about you know, most countries are
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.400]   Don't span forever where they weren't
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.160]   Possibly not great for their their citizens. Yeah, so and so i'm not saying that that's happening here
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.560]   But we need to when we start thinking about these rules and how they're gonna over arch and how they're gonna affect us over
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.520]   Our lifetimes we do need to think about what if this country?
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.800]   You know didn't continue the trajectory that it has and
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   Did something, you know turned south
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:44.400]   Are we going to be able to protect ourselves should also point out that that supreme court decision wasn't perhaps as protective as you might think because
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.360]   Justice roberts in writing the decision
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:53.920]   Yeah, said the narrow issue he narrowed it first of all and he also said the issue was that they collected more than seven days of data
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:48:00.000]   Which gives police information about more than just the crimes but an intimate window into the person's life
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:08.080]   But he when he left unsaid was what what happens if it's less than seven days so a single request for location for instance
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.160]   Probably is a free by this. It's a really interesting ruling
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.640]   And it's worth reading the entire thing
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:21.120]   One one part of the majority opinion was that that I think was a big victory was the acknowledgement that look but
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.960]   The founding fathers did not anticipate a device that turns into essentially a wiretap
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.920]   Every when we're talking about a collection of data that is where you are at every minute of every single day
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.400]   This is no normal piece of property
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.000]   This is something that would give the government an incredible amount of power and therefore the government should be required to
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.560]   be held to a higher standard of
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.640]   Getting that getting a high getting of establishing probable cause
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.960]   So yeah, you're right and they also make sure that we're saying look we're only talking about this use of cell phone data
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.680]   Of tower data getting being being
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:04.960]   Getting a warrant for cell phone tower location data from carriers. We're not necessarily talking about the data that's on the phone
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.360]   We're leaving that alone, but I would say that that was a victory because they could have said look
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.160]   Fourth amendment absolutely doesn't apply in this case
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:18.000]   Of a search as a search as a search no matter what it is go nuts and the least we at least
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.200]   I hope it doesn't sound cynical that we're that I'm I'm celebrating that we didn't
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   That the barn didn't burn down
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   Life stock
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.400]   The other thing to remember too is that whatever applies to one country is going to apply to every country's and that's one of the
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.240]   Concerns that apple and other like on microsoft and google have is that laws?
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.000]   Inactive in the us will not just will not just be confined to the us in a minute
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.040]   The fbi gets access to phones china is going to want and russia is going to want it and countries where they execute people based solely on their opinion
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.720]   Or the whims of the dictator du jour are going to get are going to demand and have no reason not to expect the exact same access
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:58.160]   So when we think about our policies for these things you've got to do exactly what Alex has not just what company could do with this
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.560]   Contract, but what what's the worst thing a government could do with access to this information?
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.760]   I loved the line in roberts
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.840]   Majority
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.200]   Decision where he says when the government tracks the location of a cell phone
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.240]   It achieves near perfect surveillance as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.560]   And and there was a brief filed by apple as well as facebook and google that said no constant
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.960]   I think this is probably was persuasive to the judges. No constitutional doctrine
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.440]   Should presume the consumers assume the risk of warrantless government surveillance
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.880]   Simply by using technologies that are beneficial and increasingly integrated into modern life
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.640]   Uh, that's boy. That's absolutely true and I hope that's now
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.000]   We've got a newly reconstituted court or we'll have some
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.440]   Rocker was the turn on this so I don't think yeah, he's the swing vote now. Uh, yeah, well, we'll see
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.800]   We'll see uh, Kennedy also voted
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.360]   Firmively
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.520]   Let me so to wrap this up
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:03.680]   Let me just clarify this if law enforcement carries a camera connection kit with them at all times
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.400]   They apprehend somebody
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.960]   Uh, even if the phone's locked
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.800]   If the guys unlocked it within less than an hour and they plug in that camera connection kit
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.080]   They and then put it in a bag so he can't erase it
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:24.800]   Uh, then they they will still have unlimited time to access the contents of that phone based on how it operates right now
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.160]   Yeah, and provided the guy didn't hit sos mode or otherwise put it into a lock state. Right like my
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.440]   This is this is my understanding that i'm saying
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.680]   Partly to be helpful and partly so that rene can shoot me down if i've got it wrong
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.800]   But i've i got i got the impression it's sort of like a severed arm at an accent scene
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.880]   We're going to throw it in a bucket of ice
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.280]   And transport it it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't mean that you've got the arm reattached
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.400]   But it means that you at least you are preserving the possibility of getting at that of getting at the data
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.600]   As opposed to having no possibility of doing it if you if you delay
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.960]   Yeah, the data is encrypted right if it's the phone is locked the data is encrypted
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.200]   So then you have to have a long
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.520]   You can get the data off of an america. Yeah
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.280]   I think this wins is being the most gory conversation we've ever had on macrae
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.520]   Actually, where do we stand on where do we stand on that right now?
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.640]   I've got a sixth let's say I actually have a longer pass really long pass. Let's say I have a six digit code
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.920]   On this they do that they arrest me. I unlocked the phone within 59 minutes
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.680]   Of the arrest they immediately plugged in the camera connection kit took it home plugged it into a celeb rider a gray shift
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.000]   What do they get and what can they do with it?
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.440]   I don't know if it's known right now because you your apple fixes things with every updated release and they've been very coy about
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   Whether they're their software still works presume if we go back to the old state
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.640]   I I forget what it was it was days for four weeks for six and then
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.240]   Theoretically the entropy level of the universe if you had 64 digit binary blobs
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:01.520]   So i'm using a i don't know 15 character passphrase that means it's that would take it's encrypted and they can't on a no
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.520]   Tool that they can use even though they have the blob there's no longer any
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.000]   You know restriction of them banging on it. They odds are astro yeah
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.200]   I mean like there's they could always like theoretically put the exact right password in first, but the odds of that happening
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.720]   Are that's why I don't actually use an america passcode. I use an alpha
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.880]   I have one more discussions. I switched mine to a long obscure phrase
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.480]   But but it would take social engineering in my case would be almost impossible social engineering to come up with that phrase right exactly
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.720]   And last time we were talking about this, uh, I was I had been talking to some
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   Like PhD security people who they there was a couple people that I know that will talk to me about theoretical things
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:45.120]   Meaning as this possible is this not possible when if you ask them is it possible to create a level of encryption?
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.680]   So that there is a backdoor that is almost as completely
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.800]   Erationally secure as no backdoor
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.400]   They will tell me that yes in theory, but no one has got this working even close yet
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.880]   But they were telling me as far as they know as far as they're aware about how the iphone works
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.480]   There's still no way to get to it to an encrypted into it encrypted phone
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.200]   Without a password and brute forcing is the only way that they know of to get at it
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:16.800]   Which doesn't mean that i'm talking to our people doesn't mean that they've been they've signed something that said that we're not going to ever
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.400]   Indicate that we found the magic the magic twinkie that gets us in there, but uh, it's not possible to
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:29.680]   As the biggest the biggest step was simply encrypting the contents of this phone because before that you could simply take apart the phone
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.480]   Take out that ram chip put it into a new carrier
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.120]   Essentially turn it into a flash drive and just get the bits off of the actual ram
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.640]   But that's even something that drastic is just not going to work anymore
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.080]   That's why law enforcement really wants to have this precedent that says that we have the ability we have the
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:52.240]   The right to have access to a phone if we've established legal right to get access into that thing
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.360]   And like for nay said it would be so un
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.680]   I'm not saying we're tearing down the entire phone industry
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:06.880]   But i'm saying would be so complicated and create such a nest of such a nest of vipers and worms that
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.440]   Only a company the size of google or apple could possibly fulfill the needs of law enforcement
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:19.760]   Not only not only the us but across the world if that were established as something that their phones have to absolutely
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.400]   conform to
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.400]   Um
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.480]   Here's another apple rumor we can debunk
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:34.800]   Apple dropping intel as radio chip supplier killing off the product intel fires everybody. Oh no, sorry
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.520]   That was wrong
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.720]   So
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.520]   Is very confusing
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.880]   So this came from um ctech right cte a
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:56.160]   H apple will not provide five g modems i intel will not provide five g modems for apple's 2020 mobile devices
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:03.120]   according to internal company communications reviewed by calculus and people familiar with the matter
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:10.480]   So uh at that point the team uh, uh who was working on the product internally called sunny peak
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:18.080]   The development was halted the team was redirected to other efforts update intel says
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.840]   Now now our roadmap has not changed for 2018 through 2020 remain committed
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.640]   to our 5g plans and projects
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.280]   So what's going on?
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:34.800]   It's super interesting because you know, there's a bit of a pile on an intel right now because they're having such a hard time with
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.160]   Process nodes and ncpus, which is usually there just their strength
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.720]   But they decided they wanted to get into the modem business
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.680]   I mean it's fair qualcom makes both modems and chipsets so i can't intel and they've got an cineon
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.160]   You may have an intel radio in your iphone
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.600]   They've yeah, they bought in fidian
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.520]   Which is the first iphone modem maker before apple even used qualcom modems
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.240]   They used nphineon and intel bought them and then relobbed for apples a modem business
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.200]   And because everybody kind of hates the patent role disguised as an ip maker qualcom
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:08.640]   It is it is not easy, but it's tempting to do business with almost anybody else
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   And there's a ton of lawsuits qualcom is suing everybody's suing qualcom
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.680]   And there's some there was some theory that maybe just intel was a
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:21.840]   Casualty of the lawsuit so they weren't allowed to use the technology that qualcom was working on for 5g
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:28.160]   And though it and thus couldn't supply them but intel says that's not the case and apple and everybody are apparently
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.000]   It's hard to talk about 2020 iphones already leo because we don't even have the 2018 ones
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.120]   Right, uh, but as of right now they say their plans are unchanged
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:41.760]   Okay, and also remember that it's only in lath only in the past few weeks that they've even locked down the 5g standard
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.840]   That now it's only in the in june that everybody there's every like intel qualcom everybody that's been making these
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.760]   speculative
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.640]   Modem chips that will work with whatever they said
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:59.200]   5g was going to be back in december now they can actually start building stuff as though they're going to actually be able to ship them
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:05.600]   So yeah, this it's good the most carriers are saying that there will have some sort of 5g product
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:13.040]   Maybe in 2019 and maybe and instead of being a phone product it would be essentially a way of delivering broadband to a house
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.680]   So i'd happen to run a cable there and they're not saying they're not talking about 5g deployment until 2020
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.440]   So it's kind of early to just say that apple has decided
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:27.840]   That they've just that they're not going to use intel anymore unless they've already decided that in that intel
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.680]   They've got they've they've they've taken a penny in processor
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:38.640]   Raptor and fish sent it to intel saying that your platform on apple sleeps with the fishes
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.000]   Which they haven't done yet, but they might they might be that spiteful
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   And it's I mean and
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.320]   5g is going to be a massive investment. Yeah, you know, so I think that there's a
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.640]   incredible amount of
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:56.160]   Excitement and you know within the industry related to how much the people who are making the infrastructure not the I mean
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.760]   I'm sure there's excitement among the people who are going to sell it like at and to your
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.640]   Verizon but the people who are making all the technology
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.840]   It's it's a massive
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.560]   Outlates the most expensive cellular outlay
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:14.000]   Information or information outlay in the history of the you know, yeah world
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.880]   So it's big. No, it's big. No, it's not it's not just the speed
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   It's not just taking advantage of existing
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.560]   bands of radio
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.360]   But in the second wave of 5g devices when you're talking about
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.480]   Latency of something what what one millisecond or is even they're talking. Yeah one one millisecond or less
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.760]   Right, and so I don't understand like that that's outside of my
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.160]   You know the one of the one of the things that makes it so expensive to roll out is that the trans
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.920]   Transhavers are like I believe that they're they're ranges like 250 feet
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.000]   So it's just an enormous
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.520]   You know to get 5g is really going to work mostly in the cities in a little bit in the country
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.080]   In areas where we they people choose to do it
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:55.120]   But that's going to greatly lower latency great greatly increase the bandwidth
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.560]   Um, which they may or may not give back to the consumers. That's a big
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.680]   Well, it's such a it's not it's not a software upgrade. They can't use existing infrastructure
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.280]   They have to reap they have to build an entirely new network to make this work. So
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.400]   If you can if you are happy
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.800]   If you are unhappy with how you're being billed for broadband now, you're not going to be more happy
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.640]   When 5g rolls out because they're gonna have they're gonna have a lot of expenses to roll out
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:27.920]   Well, I even talked I even talked to one person at a company that I'm not allowed to name who said that they are intentionally going to be rolling out 5g
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.400]   in smaller areas
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.840]   Specifically because the beamforming that's going to be required to make sure that 5g works in a city
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.040]   Or getting those signals to wrap around buildings and interstates
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.240]   They know that they can get it in a small city like few little cities where they see where they there is still a law on the books
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.320]   Is I see this church steeple in downtown?
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.880]   No building can be higher than this church steeple. That's going to be the first city to get 5g
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.080]   Whereas New York or LA or San Francisco is going to be later to get it. It's going to be a big big deal
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.960]   Yeah, stacey haganbotham told us that
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.760]   She's been looking into this as well
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.280]   That five one of the one of the attributes of 5g is that you need many many more cell towers
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.520]   And that calls to each of those towers that because I guess because of the beamforming so
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:19.280]   There's going to be a lot of hurdles to also it also means that the accuracy of where it knows where you are
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:25.040]   Who gets back to our earlier conversation is much much higher because you're touching so many transceivers while you're walking
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.680]   Right, you know that you know because they're talking about exactly where you are
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.640]   Yeah
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.280]   At that point though of transceivers and all the money so
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.000]   It doesn't really matter. It's less than less than three feet. How's your russian Andy?
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.160]   So you snare for me. It looks to be about next both you and i'm a really happy you
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.760]   Particle lania see lana ron there. Yeah, it's for simple techniques. What communist my video. Oh, spasibo
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:55.200]   Can you read this table because uh apple has filed with the uh, asian
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.480]   Actually, it's russia with the asian consumer electronics commission
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   uh for five new ipad models and
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.920]   And hortaschos spasibo and orcho hortaschos or chin hortaschos and uh five new ipad models
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.680]   Now this is an april filing, but it's kind of like an fcc filing it predates
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.160]   Uh, now how's your french because rene because this was console mac that discovered this
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.360]   The new voe ipad a mac pouta bird on our posh are approaching so
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.480]   No, i'll meet up probably in the fall, right?
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.200]   The i mean these things are exactly what you said there fcc for the european
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.880]   Uh, east european commission and that means that apple has to file them not all the products
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.800]   I believe that i've shown up in these of always shipped. Oh, so it doesn't mean it'll ship
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.600]   It just means no, but i don't think it can ship without it so right so there's some fun thrown in perhaps
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.880]   Maybe or there's just you know, they they don't end up shipping the gold version of the iphone 10 for example
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.480]   They consolidate on the on the silver and the space gray, but they want their options open in case they do want to sell it
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.400]   But this is highly believable to me because we have the ipad pro refresh now rumored for september
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.400]   And uh as far as i know intel released the coffee lake chips that apple have been waiting for a couple months ago
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.480]   Those are the ones would that are multi-corp would also have the iris pro graphics in them because everybody thinks a minute intel announces coffee
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.000]   Like where's where's my new mac book?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.600]   But apple uses very specific chips in the mac book pros and the i'm x
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.880]   And also once they get them they don't have a lot of faith and intel anymore because we've all seen like how surfaces will melt
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.720]   In people's bag so they test the bejibas out of those chips and they make sure that you know, wake to like wake and sleep works
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.200]   Power nap works all their integration works
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.840]   And now that they have teach ups inside two of the teach ups have to handle some things and the intel chips
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.040]   After so it seems like we're getting to the point where all that has been done
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.600]   So i think this is probably highly relevant
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.120]   Reliable is the wrong word, but i think this is one of the steps we need to see along the way to those things coming out. Yeah
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.040]   So there are a 13.3 inch mac book pro without touch bar with
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.000]   touch bar and a 15.4 inch mac book pro
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.360]   Um doesn't look like there's anything for the mac book air or mac book
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.720]   I think two of those are mac. Are they?
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.160]   I don't know if the air is in there maybe this is my french
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.880]   uh, konika respond
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:24.240]   Do's neo mac book air dollar or form actual
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.600]   Pusiromo on tat de sepe anyway, I don't understand it. Yeah, so maybe they're not in these codes, but I think maybe not in these codes
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.720]   Yeah, 1931 1932 1988 1989 and 1990
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.960]   I am so not a fan of the intel core processors that are included in the mac book 12 inch that if there is any way apple
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.040]   To get off intel. We named them as i chips like to try to fall out. We're not
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.000]   Those are those like i fanless is great, but those chips just choke
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.520]   So I would much rather get off that one is what is intel call
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:01.360]   The chip in the new uh, microsoft surface pentium gold gold is the pentium gold
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.000]   Pentium's baby
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.360]   That is the most we lower the price well, we got this fab that we can't so the gold is playing around dual core
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.920]   chip
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.640]   Pentium gold processor that is like the pentium m right I mean it's
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.360]   George's husband Anthony got me to go down the rabbit hole of watching all the chip
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.560]   Uh, like the deep chip nerd videos where you watch like a door tv, you know
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.280]   Well, they take they bend them to see what their actual speeds are and compare and you like it is such a rabbit hole
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.080]   But you quickly find out that not all these chips are created equal
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:40.800]   Yeah, and they're often like they're often deliberately handicapped like I forget it was a core m3 that just until basically breaks it
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.040]   Right is not as good as the core fuck. They have a long history of doing that. Yeah making
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.280]   Uh, you know the celeron. Well, we just take would just disable the l2 cash and now it's a celeron
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:58.000]   Yeah, I mean it's it's it's weird. I've been uh, I I don't obviously I don't have access to the to the new surface go
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.600]   Uh, but i've been looking really hard at the specs and it seems like a really odd
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.040]   Device, um to make a and in reference to the aimed at the ipad. Isn't it?
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.320]   Well, see it see that's the weird things that again making making this relevant to ipad talk
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.120]   I don't see anything in here that would make it really competitive with the ipad
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.040]   Uh, they were when microsoft was talking about how closely they were working with intel
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.880]   Uh to optimize uh, microsoft office apps and microsoft suite apps and make sure that it runs very very nicely
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:34.320]   Uh on this penny em gold processor and people I know who had chance to get some hands-on say that even intensive apps
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:41.600]   Uh such as uh, even even like the more intensive sort of office apps seem to work just fine with it
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.920]   But we're talking about specific apps that were specifically optimized to work on this device
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.520]   And if you're selling this as a what amounts to frankly a 500
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.800]   Windows notebook by the time you add that really cool keyboard to it
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.360]   You're gonna have a hard time
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.080]   Assuring people that third party windows apps are gonna be
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.520]   Responsive or or alone sprightly and then you're also comparing it to a 500
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.520]   Like samsung chrome book, which is a superb five. I mean if you're talking about best way to spend 500
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.400]   Five you've got 500 dollars to spend on a notebook and you want the best thing you can get for that 500 bucks
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.320]   That's
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   Hard to surpass that as a recommendation
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.040]   So you're not really I don't think they're i'd be surprised if it's kind of outperform a chrome book
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:32.720]   Which is just like just like ios another operating system that is really super optimized to be an inexpensive but well-made machine
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.240]   So i'm it might be it might be they're aiming for these
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.560]   The market where
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.200]   They they are in a position where they can sell five to 500 to a thousand of these to a company at a time
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.600]   Just to send out to their salesman and to their workforce and it'll work just fine for that
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:54.080]   But it doesn't feel like it's a it's a it's a competitor to even the $300
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:01.360]   Education iPad which has it has been able to handle pretty much everything i've thrown at it with the apple pencil
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.840]   So i don't think it's a competition to the iPad. I don't know what I don't know what it's a competition for
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.040]   I know i'm kind of looking at it thinking i'd like it. I mean it's running windows
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.480]   It's so it's a full operating system. You got a pen with it
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.960]   You got a keyboard. It's a size size of an iPad and roughly the price of an iPad
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.160]   It starts at $399
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.560]   Also, and also the the ergonomics are wonderful that that I wish that the ipad had that really really great kickstand hinge
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.200]   That surface models have yes because it's variable so you can have any any angle but you can have a variety of angles including
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.200]   I think for me is like still the
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.280]   The partners like the OEMs at a certain point like you'll make so don't worry
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.320]   We're making like google and microsoft walls. We're making super premium computers to show the future of where this technology can go
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.280]   We're not really interfering with your business and then just only but sure like the people running all these companies
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.520]   I don't know what what the sign on their forehead says
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.920]   But microsoft and and google are both making the most interesting products in the category now
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.480]   And I if I was hp and I was del I would not I would wonder what the deal you know
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.480]   If Vader was changing the terms of the bargain again
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.920]   It kind of cracks me up that they're building this is a business device. It's clearly a student device, isn't it?
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:14.720]   Again, if you if you're a company and you're buying devices by the hundreds to hand out people that have a very very predictable
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.840]   Brief on what they're going to be using their work computers for
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.640]   It's not it doesn't seem ridiculous that they would create a device that costs that
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.360]   It's a it's a surface grade product in terms of build quality and ergonomics
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.200]   It costs 500 bucks and we'll run microsoft office as well as anything that costs up to six or seven hundred dollars
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.880]   I could see that uh, but until I get my hands on one
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.280]   uh, I don't know if I would
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.520]   Council anybody to get excited about buying this as a consumer. I just think I just think that for most people
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:52.400]   For regular use like 90 percent of the population could use an iPad, you know, I I can't I mean I use it in specialty areas
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.680]   Um and for viewing watching movies on planes and and I you know, I do use it every day
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.240]   But not like it's my primary still my Mac
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.520]   But when I look at other people that are even in our in our company
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.480]   There's nothing that they're doing that they couldn't do on an iPad
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.960]   I mean, and I think that that's the
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.600]   That's the direction that we're going to I think that we got to this point where
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.360]   People are buying all those cheap computers and they're having trouble upgrade people getting buying upgrades because the computer did everything they needed to
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.840]   You know excel ran as fast as it needed to run
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.840]   And I think that that's the that's the real issue. That's where the growth market is is in this
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.200]   But being able to touch it and I think that apple still like they missed the boat in subscription with spotify
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.440]   They're missing the boat with touchscreen with the laptops, you know an eventually thing too
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.200]   It's like again back when the iPad two came out. It was mostly my old
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.520]   And using the they were because they were older to me
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.640]   They were a whole generation ahead of me, but it was my high school teachers who were all lined up
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.120]   And it was an entire generation of people for whom computers had always they knew about them
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:54.560]   But they were not for them and these were smart educated dialed in creative professional people who just never had an affinity for
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.800]   Traditional computers from the command line to the gooey and when they saw an iPad
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.280]   They just got they could it was just you could touch it
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.280]   You could move things around there was no file system to worry about and yeah, it was super limited
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.880]   But for them that was a feature and it's sort of grown up with all those people now
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.360]   But it's still way more approachable whether you're uh in like maybe not an infant
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.840]   But whether you're a child or you're somebody who's in there's 80s or 90s trying their first computer
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:22.720]   I think that was sort of the magic moment with ipad and now we're getting a lot of computers that are becoming
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:29.120]   More and more accessible and they're really hitting the mainstream and computing has gone from this niche thing that only like the nerds
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.840]   And maybe it's a scientist and students and enterprise people did and how everybody has access to really powerful computing technology
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.800]   Not just powerful in terms of chips, but in what it empowers them to do
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.920]   And that's the part that's got me got me super excited about all this
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.440]   And I do feel like you see this growing it's like this squeeze where I see people in the what I'm in the airport
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.560]   You see people who are uh, you know, it's it was like over 60 and under
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:58.000]   15 and now it's like under 25 and over 50 and it's like this
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.320]   The squeeze of everybody's got ipads and then there's a couple of us in the middle that are still using our computers
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.600]   My mom calls it a computer. So where's my computer pass when my computer for her?
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.160]   It's her and she has and I am actually barely uses anymore
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.040]   Because it's so much fun more fun and easier and whatever for her to use her iPad anywhere
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.480]   Well, I just ordered one. We'll see
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.520]   Comes august second. So we we have a little time before we'll be able to play with it a few weeks
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:27.360]   My biggest question is that like there like this is thirst in the tech press for different things like the blackberry passport comes out
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.640]   And we're like yes, it's not boring. It's a square, you know
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.520]   It's amazing blackberries not afraid to try and then ah it's a failure and we don't go pay backberries bills
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.040]   You know because of that and there's like oh, you know these companies are being super quick
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.800]   They can afford to do that because they have a whole oem market making the work a day computer
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.680]   So it sort of gives them room to be creative like this
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.840]   But we we applaud and award them, but we still I still want them to make successful products
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.000]   So I hope that this is also not just
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.680]   What an experiment, but I hope it's it's a product that's designed to be a hit
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.400]   That's why I'm glad this I'm glad that I used to get really really frustrated
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.400]   When it seemed to be the go-to phrase when someone was writing a hot take on like a non-apple product
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.040]   Oh, they just don't get it. They just don't get design saying, you know, they get it
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   They're just they're just they're just in a different business than other people are
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.560]   Well, it's a killer. It's an apple killer in the same sentence. Right, right
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.200]   Exactly like i'm not how you drive traffic. Come on
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.560]   Microsoft can take these chain
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.040]   Microsoft can can afford to take chances because they are they they are selling to they are the world's operating system
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.360]   They're not just enterprise. They're not just business. They are the computers that everybody
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.080]   By default buys
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.640]   Which means that they can add they can they can create their own statement without taking over del without taking over anybody else
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.760]   apple has the power to do whatever they want because
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.680]   It's it's like well if you if you don't like our banana shaped keyboard
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.120]   There's the door go go go buys anybody else's computer
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.480]   But if you want it to run Mac OS, you're gonna learn to love our banana shaped keyboard
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.160]   So when you have a company particularly a smaller one that's trying to find a way
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:10.960]   To they can't make they can't make us a stock boring computer because del and hp have got that absolutely locked up
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.480]   Not not meant as an insult again. There's most people need boring computers that are affordable and durable
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:25.040]   They can't they don't have the rnd or the experience to do something that is hugely innovative because they don't have the money to explain to people how these things work
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.400]   So I do I won't ever stop
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.760]   I won't say complaining, but at least mentioning that I feel as though in the past 28 years
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.920]   We can come up with something better than a keyboard and a screen separated by a hinge
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.440]   But when all when that's all that anybody wants to buy
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:47.040]   It's hard to convince people that this new glowing orb is going to be the is really going to be much better than anything
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.040]   You could even imagine if anyone's interested. I had brian hall on vector last month
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   He was vice president of surface at microsoft during house and he explains how they did the marketing how they tried to compete with the macbook
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.800]   And then tried to compete with the ipad and sort of why they went after design and the holes
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.880]   They saw in the market and strategy that came up with and it was he's super fascinating. Yeah
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:13.280]   Yeah, we'll talk. I'm sure extensively about surface go tomorrow and windows weekly, but it is it is kind of germane to the apple
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.520]   It's definitely relevant, but
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:23.360]   Especially again, especially with that really wonderful 325 dollar ipad that is it's so I'm I'm
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.800]   I'm comfortable identifying that as the default ipad for anybody. I still have my ipad pro still have my ipad pro
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   Uh, but if I work my ipad I have the first generation one
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.280]   And so I might be attracted to getting a new ipad pro sometime this year next year
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.000]   But I can't absolutely for sure say that if I if I if I drop and broke this drop my ipad and broke the screen
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.920]   I can't say for sure that I wouldn't just say why don't I just save 600 dollars and just get a
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.040]   $25 or ipad. I'll just max out the ram
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.680]   Because it's so darn fast and it does pretty much everything I want
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.720]   So to get back to these uh, this this leak to the Eurasian
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.320]   electronics commission
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.520]   Nine and five said three of the numbers in 1988
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.480]   1999 1990 would make sense as new macbook pro skews and we have seen I guess
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.880]   Geekbench has seen some benchmarks
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.440]   Uh that might indicate some
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.360]   Blacklist beach bench at this point. I mean there's iphone
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.320]   I phone 11 geekbench scores at new mine. Oh, it's pretty amazing. It's a great leak source
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.240]   um
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.720]   It's not completely clear what the new ipad
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.080]   Numbers would be
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:44.000]   Um, or what what their numbers indicate so, uh, but I would love I presume we're gonna see new ipad
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.160]   Of some kind maybe a new ipad pro. Well, I mean, I was a giermo
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.280]   I think your mo rambo found the uh an emoji interface for the ipad
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:17:00.800]   Gotta be true. It's gotta be true depth. We have birthday cupcakes not just for Alex lindsey
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:07.600]   But today is the tenth birthday of the apple app store the iphone app store. I always were born together
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.840]   It's the app store in Nikola Tesla Tesla's birthday too. Sure. Well in that case i'm gonna have another cupcake
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.680]   Have a couple of good things. I'm an electric company in honor of that birthday
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.640]   We will sing the first four words of happy birthday, which you get for free if you want to buy a pack of 20 more words
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.360]   And purchases of five dollars. Yeah, we already sang it. It's too late
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.400]   You did the you did the chorus and I think you did more than 10 words, Andy. So expect a bill
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.480]   No, uh tenth anniversary of the app store. I think you want to say about that is uh, I mean that was a big deal
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.680]   I did is it my memory and correct didn't Steve jobs not want an app store at first
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.040]   So that's an urban myth and i've talked to a lot of people about it
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.840]   We're actually involved at apple at the time working on it
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.320]   And the apple is a platform company and apple always wanted iphone to be a platform
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.640]   However, it was so hard to get the iphone to ship by june
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.040]   2007 that they had zero bandwidth to actually come up with an app store strategy
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.920]   And the teams were so exhausted that there was no way they were going to get it done anytime soon
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.920]   It was going to take a year maybe more than a year
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.040]   Which is why they tried to do the web app as the sweet solution
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.480]   But then that fell with such a thud. They had to go and say look
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.000]   We know you just did a forced march. You just did a marathon of sprints
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.560]   Can you please pick yourselves up and do it again for next year?
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.320]   And they all just looked at each other and said oh, we absolutely have to do this
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.600]   And they had a little debate about whether it should be app kit or web kit
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.880]   And even the web kit people said no, it's got it can't be web kit is just not there yet for this kind of stuff
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.400]   You can have web views inside your apps, but you need poco so they came up with UI kit and then they
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.520]   busted tail to get that ready for that february event and
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:55.600]   I think basically did another forced march for the remaining nine months and and got it done
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   Well, it turned out to be a good thing for sure. It's created a
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.000]   An entire economy around it and it's generated a significant amount of revenue for apple
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.440]   I don't know how much of the
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.880]   $9.2 billion they made last quarter in services was the app store
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.760]   But I have to think it was the lion's share a lot and it made apps popular and it made developer
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.840]   Like it brought them all into popular culture now
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.800]   Used to be an obscure thing that maybe you got like the adobe
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.560]   licenses or
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.400]   Microsoft office that your business and maybe you got some shareware or freeware
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:31.280]   But it wasn't the like movies or music or you know even video games and now it is popular culture and developers are
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.600]   Popular culture like people think about it as a
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.520]   Top for you astronaut firemen. I want to make an app
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.400]   No, it's really true. I get calls all the time on the radio show. I got a brilliant idea for an app
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.080]   Do you can you tell me somebody who can write it for me? It's like dude
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.000]   It's incredible democratization
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.800]   Of you know, even if you
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.160]   I mean kids 10 year old is it flappy bird? Yeah, that was poor guy the poor guy to be the major
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:05.120]   The major was not ready for the for selling couldn't believe you made millions. Yeah in in a place that you're not supposed to
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.480]   I mean, I mean I meet 10 10 11 12 year olds all the time
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:16.080]   Who want to write and some are actually writing and some have even published yep apps in the app store
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:21.760]   That's a great thing and and and the fact that it's so inexpensive and it's so easy and you really can't build a business around
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:26.320]   It's almost like the next generation of delivery. I wonder how many app developers make money
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.400]   Well, no, but there are a lot of businesses don't make money on it
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.480]   I mean like you know most restaurants go under most other
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.840]   You know, there's you see it harder to make a success in the app store than it is as a
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.880]   As a restaurant, uh, it is much much less expensive
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.040]   And you're only doing with yourself. I mean your spare time
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.560]   The risk is a lot low
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.160]   There's definitely plenty of people who fail at it then they say oh, we can't make any money on the app store
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.840]   But then there's all these people that you know
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.360]   It doesn't mean that you can just put it up on the app store and expect everyone to use it
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.280]   You still have to think about B. R. You still have to have well, it has to be great
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:05.360]   Yeah, it has to be and and that's the thing is that the UI the user experience on on the on iOS app has to be very good
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.560]   I think that unless you do something really obscure. You cannot have
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.160]   Anything that's hokey because I know as a user I figured out this is hokey
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.880]   You know like and I just stopped using it almost immediately just over the design, you know unless something is
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.720]   Uh, you know that so you you still have to think about that process
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.560]   You know the and I think that a lot of people don't they just throw it up there and go well
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.640]   No one bought it. Well, yeah, there had to been
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.520]   Some work around that, you know to make it work
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.840]   But I will say the other thing that people I've talked to a couple folks that getting recommended on the fact
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:43.600]   My apple that helps is it's like it's like literally some of them have retired on that just on a recommendation
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.240]   I mean a well built app and then showing up on the front page is
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.200]   um, there was a someone I knew I'll not make it specific but that uh
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.640]   Their app was featured in one of the ads
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.160]   And they just said it was stunning
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.480]   No, it wasn't about house. No, it was you know in a week, you know, it's just so there's uh, you know
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.840]   There are and and again, and there's not that many other places in the world other than
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.960]   Sports which is just as random, you know that you could make that much money that quickly
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:18.880]   You know, there was a couple articles that is trism guy and twitter tweedy guy like lorm britter and I forget the
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.800]   Trism guy, but how much they were making at the height of the app store and it was ludicrous numbers
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.320]   Yeah, yeah, but that but that that is such an apt analogy though
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.720]   It's like there are people who are
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.440]   who can start with nothing and
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   By the age of 18 be signed to a five-year nba contract worth $10 million a year
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.160]   And that's what gets all of these kids
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:48.240]   Like in neglecting their studies to make sure that they become really good at basketball because they don't imagine themselves being one of the
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.560]   28% of aspiring to blow out a knee at age 14
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.240]   Yeah, but the difference is of course the difference is is that is that when you when you turn 18 and you don't get signed
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:03.120]   All you know how to do is play basketball, you know when you turn 18 and you don't get signed for this
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.680]   You know how to program code, you know, that was uh, you got a really good skill
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.000]   It's a skill that almost everybody wants so right so it's not a bad bad thing
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.040]   I'm trying to slowly pull my kids into programming just so that they
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.880]   You don't want to work. We just teach them swift. I don't it's all I'm teaching them. It's swift
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.000]   Because I'm not even well
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.240]   I mean that and a variety of coding for our do we know and yeah, that kind of thing
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.120]   So it's you know, it's a little bit of mixed the idea of thinking about it
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   I at first I don't want them thinking about they could get a job or anything else
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120]   I just want them to see that using like fun
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.000]   Like it's fun. It's just fun. It's just a fix thing
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.840]   Like that's why we were talking about like how to water the plants or how to do these other things
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   Just how to fix things like I think if you're gonna succeed as a coder you got to actually enjoy it
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.040]   I learned how to code because I was I need I was tired of rolling dice for Dungeons and Dragons
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.720]   My first app was it was something just just create a non-player characters because I was a dungeon master
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.160]   And I couldn't I was like this is taking forever to build all these non-player characters
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.720]   Yeah, you know and and uh and so that was my that was my impetus and then I uh did rocket trajectories
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.480]   Interesting learned a lot more. Yeah, that that that's that's why I don't like when when people show me curricula for
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:17.920]   For learning for programming. I'm always kind of kind of bummed out when it really is more like here
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.680]   We're gonna teach you how to do math like no, that's not how programming works
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:27.920]   Just you know, we don't we don't teach we give kids paper and crayons and tell them to draw whatever they want
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.440]   Uh, we don't teach them all about the history of the crayon
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.440]   We don't tell them about how varying pressure can create great varying lines
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.760]   The way to teach programming is to say what what kind of app is not out there yet?
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.360]   But you'd love to have and doesn't have to be I'm not talking about making success
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.240]   Success in the app stores like for you for you little Alex. What is the little Alex app?
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.280]   So I want one so that every time I have a piece of gum
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.720]   I can keep track of what kind of piece of gum I had and how it lasted great. So we're gonna for the next four weeks
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.280]   We're gonna build and little Alex's piece of gum how long did that last app and that's how you learn step by step by step
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.600]   Let's that really is the way to go
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.800]   But one one thing I really wanted to respond to though is that
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.200]   um
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.200]   I don't think I don't think we should give
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.720]   All the credit to the app store. I think there's a three-legged stool here that the app store would not have had
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.440]   You need the app store. You need a powerful mobile device and you need mobile broadband
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.840]   Uh, it wasn't with with what with any one of these three legs of the stool missing
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:34.400]   I agree neither of them would have been quite so good. We had we had uh mobile apps and stores where you can get mobile apps
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.240]   But we didn't have an internet and we didn't have something as cool as well done as the app store
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.600]   And it was the it wasn't it wasn't just the app store
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.040]   It was that someone decides to write an instagram app that can suddenly take this take this this
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.320]   You're no longer taking your phone home and syncing these wonderful two megapixel images
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.000]   And then emailing them to people on AOL. You are basically saying hey here. I am. Here's my food
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.640]   Here's the person who was mean to me at the parking lot
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.600]   And that's what gets people to the app store to find it with the next with the with the next app they want to get is
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.720]   So, when they did you get the uh poster? Uh, I I wanted this poster
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.360]   No, I didn't oh, I'm all wait a minute. This is for the five years of the app store
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.760]   Yeah, I want the 10-year poster
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:24.240]   I mean I I had a bunch of phones before the iphone mostly trios had some windows mobile devices and you
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:29.840]   You there was no singular app store. I had to go to like home info center. There was a blackberry
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.080]   It was a blackberry app store. Well, there was a crackberry store, but there was no app world until blackberry 10 came out
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.560]   Oh, really?
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.720]   Which was great for crackberry at the time
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.320]   But I mean it wasn't and like you like you I would buy them from many places
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.720]   I'd forget where they were each one had a different licensing scheme
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:51.440]   Some of them were incredibly onerous. They were super expensive like it was 40 dollars for the yellow sticky notes app and 40 dollars for iam plus
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.520]   And it was hard to install they would crash the phone like I would the phone call would come in and the app would crash the entire phone
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:04.640]   All is trying to and it was just it was such a different world and when that app store got put on there and it was secure
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.080]   And he didn't have to worry about it
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.520]   I had a bunch of developer friends who were writing the windows mobile and palm apps
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:15.280]   And they're just like there is no amount of money that we could pay that is that is worth the amount of trust that just goes into people
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.120]   Going there pressing the button and buying your app and that was like the biggest thing for them was that they could make
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.640]   Software that for the first time was really mainstream
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.240]   It was so expensive to get boxes and shrink wrap and be in the big buy stores or critter on website and do all these things
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:37.360]   We sort of take it for granted now that at any time we hit that little icon and it gives birth to a million other little icons on our phone
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.440]   And we don't have to think about it anymore and
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:45.840]   I've been to i've been to bare-bones software's offices back in the day
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   Uh, they that was they needed offices because they were doing things mail order
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.640]   They needed a room where they had where they could pack for a big paper the pack boxes and put t-shirts
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.560]   And manuals and boxes and the internet really changed all of that and it wasn't just
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.600]   For the users having this one place to come to get
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.560]   If I find where all the apps are going to be and do a search for them
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.720]   It's also your your developer your programmer you're really good at programming and you think that you've got this outliner app
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.760]   That's gonna that's actually very useful and very saleable. Now. Do you release it as freeware?
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.480]   Because and then say everybody have at it. It's wonderful. Enjoy it. I'll take my pleasure
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:28.000]   At the fact that you people enjoy it or are you going to incorporate and then figure out how to take credit card transactions and open a business card
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.440]   Open a business account at your local bank and get a lawyer to incorporate
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.360]   Uh, that was part of the problem
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.600]   That's probably part of the reasons why great apps weren't going to be turned into commercial products
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.360]   But the ability to fill out a few online forms and just simply say I don't I don't care that you're taking 30
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.640]   30 cents out of every dollar
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.840]   I'm not even gonna break it down to see if that's if I can get a better deal elsewhere
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.600]   If I can get a deal where all I do is I send you my package and then you simply send me a check from time to time
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:58.480]   Reflecting the amount of the sales that I got. I'm good. That's what brought people and when we
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.640]   when we had an app, I mean we we uh, you know, we had this green screen removal app leaving that and uh
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:11.280]   You know it was you know, we use a desktop app the desktop app. It was a plugin for final cut and um and
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.360]   It it made it made a lot of money. I mean, it wasn't you know, but it was all electronic
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.280]   The first thing we did was training which was on CDs on Photoshop and uh, you know, we developed this long plate um
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.080]   70,000 mailing list because of
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:30.560]   Uh, great wig that's great savers screen savers. I would be on every well. Congratulations. That was the whole model
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:37.840]   Because I'd always go oh, we didn't have enough time. I want to keep showing up every week every week
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.000]   What I would do is go we didn't have enough time
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.080]   To really show this so there's a video and a little tutorial and I worked all day on
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.120]   So I would spend basically two days of my life was just
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.960]   Screen savers every week because the first day I would figure it out and figure out how to do it quickly
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:58.720]   Then I'd build a fight literally a pdf of how to do whatever I was going to show on screen savers
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.600]   Then I would have a little movie on how to do it so funny and then I would put it up learning this now
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.000]   Yeah, 20 years later. So and so then I would have so it was like two days of and then I would show up like I
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.520]   Just came up with this thing, you know and and then I would I got idea
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.240]   Let's do this thing so then so then I and then what happened was you go to our website and it would put you behind
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:21.120]   It was behind an email. You know give us your email and we'll let you down watch a 20 minute version of what I did in seven minutes
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:25.520]   And there's a pdf of literally step-by-step that I painstakingly put through and tested
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.880]   I wish more of our guests had done that because that's hugely valuable
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.480]   Well, and it and it and we went right would come on happy birthday by the way 70 years old
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.800]   Bertman, where I would come on and go
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   And you got a brick wall
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.040]   Never that was always a burt could you?
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:46.880]   Right, so so and I would get a thousand new emails a week, you know of the stuff and so after a year
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.560]   So we 70,000 you know nice letter
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:51.360]   So I put out any I was like people kept on saying can you do Photoshop training now?
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.560]   I was like there are books
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.440]   There's a whole section and borders bookstore and everything else don't know we want you to do it
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.840]   So I I so I announced that hey, I'm doing it and
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:04.240]   If you uh buy right now, it's cheaper 35 bucks or something for the disc and I figured it was hell a couple hundred
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.760]   Yeah, we sold 2000 in the first day and they're on disc
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.320]   That's like we had to buy a disc printer and a thing and a thing and a thing like like we were
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.080]   We have no plan
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.960]   But now nowadays it would have just been oh you can just go there and download it with our with the other problem
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.840]   We have on our app. We got smart. No, it's no disc. You could only download it
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.440]   but it was
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.200]   I didn't put any copy, but we never told anyone but we we had a little installer
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:31.920]   But we never had any copy protection at all like we just didn't it was just like oh, I don't want to spend money on it
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.360]   and
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   And uh, we figured someone will break it anyway
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:42.080]   So why bother putting it in you know and so so we just sold this thing that had no copy protection and and it was 128k
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080]   And it was still like we had to pay someone for
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:50.560]   Managing our ecommerce and then we and we didn't have any protection now you have this incredible opportunity where it's copy, you know
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.920]   Because it's cheap because it's so protected within the same within the the ecosystem
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:01.360]   The prices for us as consumers goes down because I don't have to account for all the people stealing for it
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:06.240]   You know stealing it, you know and and there's you know, so I can sell it for five bucks or 10 bucks or 15 bucks instead of
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:12.160]   When you when you bought it before the legal people were paying 75 or $100 because there were thousands of people that were
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.960]   For every one person that was paying for there was 100 people who weren't what our companies that was the issue
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:23.600]   Instagram leaps to mind without the app story there would be no instagram which ended up selling to facebook for billion dollars
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.840]   Arguably uber. I mean
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.280]   Without without a phone app there is no uber
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:34.480]   Totally and one of the things that like you can make a lot of arguments about good choices and bad choices that apple has made
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.360]   But one of the biggest gripes is that apple has been way too restrictive
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:44.640]   But then you look at more open app stores and there's really no compelling apps that have done anything beyond what you can do in the app store
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.160]   And in fact most of the compelling apps are available on every platform now
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:52.000]   And i've really like they've changed logistics and they've changed commerce and they've changed
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   Communication like just messaging and social networks and all of these things facebook and twitter came alive because of
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.560]   Mobile, you know, absolutely twitter makes no sense without an app. Yeah, no the spotify. None of this
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:09.120]   I remember Twitter started with text messaging. So yeah, but I mean that very quickly
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.720]   It outgrew that very quickly if you ever use twitter as a text messaging
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.800]   Platform you realize getting all those messages was a bad idea
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.200]   Joe he was facebook app too. I mean that was transformative for the facebook is huge in fact facebook is the according to app any
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.840]   The number one most downloads. Do you remember when facebook came out with an apple? I was like, I don't even why the bar?
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:32.240]   Was it terrible? Like it was like, oh, this is stupid. I'm just gonna go back to you know, but they made that special framework
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.480]   I forget what it was called that everyone used it for react. Yeah, actually before that it was a web app to oh, yeah
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.280]   Yeah, yeah, that was their mistake and they even admitted that they said, you know, we just made it a website on app
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:50.240]   And uh the irony of all this is we're going back to website apps with progressive web apps and apple's gonna support it
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.920]   And so you're gonna get to now and you know soon you'll be going to websites
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:59.440]   It'll say would you like to download would you like to put this on the home page and it's a full offline app
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:06.880]   We went from Java to air to yeah electron to progressive web apps. Yeah, it is always going to be some commodity cross platform framework
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is and that's a good way to put it a commodity
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:15.440]   Yelp airbnb. Yeah, I could take a vlog app
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:22.160]   Because the season like exists with that apps we were just talking about a pokémon go you have to have location and screen and data and
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:28.320]   Yeah, you know all these things and you can say now well now that android is copied or come he started come along and had an app store
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.760]   too that
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.680]   They certainly are a big part of the ecosystem these days, but it but apple started it at all
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.880]   Yeah, the idea
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:43.040]   Yeah, yeah, and not not only that but the idea of having a completely multi touch interface without any hard lot
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:51.120]   Buttons or clicky buttons on there. So basically the ability to create an interface that's optimized for this specific task and nothing else that
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:58.240]   Are ushered in such wonderful flexibility and creativity for people where you don't have to you when there's always a clicky
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.560]   Quarry keyboard staring you in the face
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.040]   There's always going to be the impulse to use that clicky keyboard
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.920]   As opposed to realizing that the point of this app is not for people to be looking at a keyboard
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.280]   But to be looking at data so we're gonna keep that keyboard out of the way
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.040]   So yeah, it's we could have a long two hour special
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:25.680]   About every single app store on every the app store the app store on google and the app store on apple and every single piece of technology
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.360]   That both required it and both was that the app store was able was enhanced by
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.480]   It really is it's it's it's it's it's part of the glue that holds together
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:42.240]   Uh so much of the world today apple talks about emunji a name you may not know but the company that created
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.480]   temple run
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   And uh, oh, i'm sorry ken shepherd
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   And uh, natalia
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.160]   Look, yeah, nova of emunji studios temple run i didn't know this has been downloaded
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.680]   Over a billion times. I can't without the app store and you can't think of an application
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.120]   Yeah, that's been installed a billion times maybe microsoft office. I mean, right that's mind boggling
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:09.440]   Because they made it so easy and you talk about the pricing too
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.720]   But in the old days you would maybe buy two or three apps a year most people might not even that and now people want to download three
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:21.520]   Four a day sometimes before a week the entire scale is is drastically changed and apps like uh fortnite
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:27.280]   Which of course started on the desktop do so well fortnite now making what was it 150 million dollars a day
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:32.720]   On apple and we've grown from from this idea of like how do we do demos so people have gotten really good at
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.360]   I'm going to give you a free one and then you can in the in-app purchase kind of revolutionize a lot of that where I can
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.640]   You know
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.960]   You'll download it you'll play with it you get a feel for it and you hit a button and you pay for the pro version
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:49.600]   And otherwise you still got some stuff you can do and I think that has made it super easy for people to just kind of experiment and buy
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.960]   In the back that's $2.99 or $1.99 or whatever
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:37:00.320]   The amazing thing is 10 years later. We're now redefining what an app is because previously it was a binary bundle and now apple has extensibility
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.280]   Google has slices soon you're going to be using your voice to just trigger a workflow that'll have apps involved
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:12.080]   But you may not even really realize they're doing anything and it's like when websites became web APIs and you just access them from everywhere
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.560]   Apps are becoming broken down into their into their actions into their features
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.880]   And we're putting them together in new and amazing ways and what what apps are we going to have in 10 years?
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.520]   I can't even imagine how far how far along will be now
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.760]   We won't be just like we're starting to start stop thinking about files now
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.760]   We're I think we're going to be stopping thinking about apps at all in the next five years
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.360]   Which which will make it easier to yeah, which will make it easier for the app store to have
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.920]   It's a it's ultimate expression of its primary destructive power
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.120]   Which is to make sure we grind away consumers
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.800]   Expectation that any app should cost really anything at all
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.440]   They don't the only bad thing about the app store
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:59.920]   I think is that it really has gotten people that feel so entitled that oh my god
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:07.440]   You need that all it does is like oh, it's just a word processor and a presentation tool and an art program
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.840]   And has all the knowledge of the entire world in eight seconds and you want five dollars for it
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.160]   Should be three one star
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:21.440]   I mean the web did that for like content like he used to be able to charge for content and now nobody wants to pay anything for content
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.280]   And neff flicks. I think it's done that for like well
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.560]   I'm not gonna buy an itunes movie for 20 dollars if people hide it's free
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:33.360]   Well, that's well, that's that's different because most people how many how many movies or tv shows do you love enough that you want to own it?
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.600]   And so you want to be
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.600]   A good
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600]   True
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:44.720]   Who has 18 18 to this to this fourth power of watch bands?
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.360]   But and the music
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.400]   Planes about that too like we've got a Spotify and mappled music of now
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.320]   Like when you get to scale
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.400]   There the scarcity disappears and it making digital copies is
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.960]   You know, it's bits and we start to redefine what value is and it sucks for the people who create this stuff
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.760]   But it we haven't really found a way to fix that. I think across any media type yet
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:14.000]   It kind of it kind of it really sucks for the people who built their businesses based on a successful model
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.560]   That worked for far too many years to allow them to imagine it working working elsewhere
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.640]   Yeah, I mean just just just today
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.960]   I bought
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:30.240]   Last week I bought at the good will for two dollars the two cd original broad k Broadway soundtrack of ain't miss bhaven
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:38.400]   N katie langs first cd and I don't know how many times that those that music has been passing through people's hands over the past
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:43.840]   You know 20 years or so, but the record company they got their first 13 dollars and that was it
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:50.240]   Imagine imagine someone who was building a new music company or a little bit more visionary or excuse me
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.520]   A little a little they're they're not so focused on the money. They're losing by no longer being able to sell
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.560]   14 dollar albums imagine other executives who are able to say but what if we
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:07.920]   What if they just keep giving us money every single month and they never actually own anything that if they want to if this person wants
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.560]   Yes, we're gonna lose on the on the back end. We're not we're not getting
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.160]   We're not getting 14 dollars for this katie lang album, but over the next 10 years. We will get like 40 dollars
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.560]   out of this person out of plays if he actually keeps playing it so
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.880]   You never know if these uh, there's a line from the godfather
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.840]   I keep coming back to which is you know, sometimes these things they just got to happen every 10 years or so gets rid of the bad blood
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.240]   Which is not to be glib about an entire industry
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.840]   Being crushed he said as a former newspaper
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.880]   Newspaper writer. Yeah, but every 10 years or so these things have to happen
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:49.200]   We're not it's almost impossible for an an existing entrenched business to morph to change to become something completely else because
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.080]   Everybody who was at that company didn't grow up in a world where you have a phone in your hand
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.560]   That is that is a full working computer with instant access to the internet all the time
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.560]   You can't really think about how to build a product that really suits that device and really suits the individual using it
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.000]   So it's it's tough
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.120]   But the it's a rare bird that can figure out how to be making typewriters in 1977
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.240]   But how to make wristwatches that are digital and have internet connectivity in 2018
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.040]   Let's take a little break because it's time for our picks of the week and while you get ready for that
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.800]   We need to make a little coffee to go with our cupcakes. Yes. I think we should get a little something from
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.480]   Tress
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   Pontage we had some
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.680]   Brazilians in the other day and they said it's called you pronounce it tress
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:36.480]   Pontage from tress Pontage
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.320]   But if I say that you won't know how to spell it's I'm gonna say trace Pontas t-r-e-s p-o-n-t-a-s
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.240]   This is single family farm in Brazil
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.640]   The race family coffee farm. It's near the town of trace Pontas in Brazil
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:56.080]   It is a famous mountain range for growing some of the best coffee ever in the world
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.320]   The race family has been there for three generations over a hundred years
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.560]   And this is the first time they've ever exported their coffee to the us
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:08.080]   Here's your chance to try the best
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.080]   Every bag
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.760]   Is roasted by the way they ship the beans green to the us and roast them here so that you get them fresh
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.240]   From the us in fact every bag has a roast date this one uh roasted for us july second
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.240]   We got it a few days ago. That's how quickly they turn it around it may still be warm
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.120]   And every bag also has something else which I really love on the back. I could just do this real quickly here
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.560]   It's got a QR code on the back which you can scan
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.080]   And you see I'm now going to be able to open the google maps
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.800]   And it's going to say exactly
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.680]   Where this coffee came from
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.120]   Look at that
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.720]   Meaness jerese
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.680]   There's the bean. I think that's the bean right there. I zoom if I zoom in that's the one right
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:55.040]   Isn't that fun to see where your coffee's from
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:01.840]   Oh smell it too by the way whole bean coffee or you can get it grabbed, but I would suggest get whole bean coffee
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840]   It's a hundred percent of rabica beans
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.240]   Certified non gmo
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.920]   Certified kosher this is kind of taking fair trade to the next level buying directly from the farmer
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.520]   They're picked by hand roasted by hand in small batches
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.720]   And by the way
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.040]   This coffee because it's grown high in the mountains
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.480]   Is pulped natural that is not washed
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:27.120]   And you actually want the pulped to stay on the beans because that keeps the coffees smooth
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.800]   If you've been buying coffee from other regions that is there it is. There's the farm that is uh bitter
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.040]   It's because they're washed these beans don't need to be there pulped natural
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.960]   Get freshly roasted bean sent to you every one two or four weeks
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.800]   12 ounce bags
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.120]   I like this slightly smaller bag because that way you get it more often and it'll be fresh
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.200]   And by the way freshers better
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.680]   They do light medium dark or french roast if you really want to taste the bean
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.680]   I actually do get french roast because I like to espresso it
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.760]   But if you really want to taste the bean get medium at least one bag of medium once in a while and brew it in a uh
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.040]   We use the uh arrow press when you brew it in arrow press
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.760]   With a frith and a burr grinder freshly ground and you brew that is a taste
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.560]   You will never forget and but be prepared you'll never enjoy coffee from other places again
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.920]   You're gonna always want three spontas now. We have a very oh, I forgot to mention one more thing
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:24.960]   In fact, they've been selling this like crazy
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:32.160]   They also grow olives there and we only now at home use trace point us olive oil extra virgin cold press
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.480]   It's hand picked in the beautiful casablanca valley of brazil
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:43.360]   Single farm olive oil and it is that i'm gonna open it up because you can actually so good
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.440]   You actually put a little on your finger and taste it
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.000]   You'll ami- oh man. Oh, it's like you're going. It's you're like you're going to the farm
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.040]   It's not it's smooth. It's not bitter
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.720]   You know you could dip a little bread in that it would be the best thing is that good
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.080]   But here these it's yours take it with you. I'm giving you a bottle any and uh

[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.960]   It's a nectar
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:22.000]   You just drizzle some really good olive oil as a finish over whatever you're making and they look oh my god
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.400]   What did you do to this and I was just looking for some so
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.360]   So sometimes
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:33.200]   It's a look olive oil can be a little bitter. This is so smooth and sweet and delicious. It's really amazing
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.520]   So here's the deal for the coffee. I don't think I have an olive oil deal for you
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.200]   But you can go to the website and look at the olive oil trace pontas t-r-e-s-p-o-n-t-a-s

[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.840]   But if you travel there
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.840]   I mean if you move move there as a retiree
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.680]   They have some sort of deal tax-free for the first 10 years. I'll be dead after that. So that's a good deal. Yeah
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.920]   I'm just saying portugal learn some s-learn some Portuguese
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.640]   Start by getting tres pontas coffee
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.520]   Renee richy you're pick of the week
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:43.520]   So when I was at ww dc my my long serving wallet is integrated and I needed a finder replacement
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.640]   So I decided to go uh for the trendy ridge wallet and I got the middle
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:54.160]   I'm really curious in this tell us tell us about this. I wasn't sure because part of me wanted to get the
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:00.880]   Carbon fiber one just because I could wear it through airports well theoretically wear it through airport security
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:07.600]   But I ended up getting it just looked so cool titanium and I have a fondness for titanium mac books going back a long time
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.960]   And it's it's really cool. It's very low key. It's very stealth
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.200]   It'll block rfid so if if you're almost trying to pull off the chip data from your
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.680]   You know if they're trying to snoop you for a little bit of data off of your cards it blocks all that
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.920]   But I've always liked the sort of combo card money clip design
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.120]   I just had it in leather before and it didn't last very long
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.560]   So I figured this will last for a long time and it was i'd seen a couple of them a couple people had them that I knew
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560]   We're really happy with them
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:38.720]   So I thought you know it looks cool. It works. It's it so far. It's worked really really well
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.280]   And i'm hoping it is this is my concern having a metal object in your pocket
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.680]   No, I guess security scanners were the only thing that gave me some hesitation
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   But I figure I take my laptop and my phone out anyway
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.160]   I'll just take my wallet out and go through the scanner. I never put my wallet through the scanner. Anyway
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.000]   I always put in a little
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.560]   You know round dish that they have with your keys and your wallet
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:04.560]   So yeah, that doesn't work. I mean the comfort wise you it's it's so small you barely
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.560]   I mean like I again, I have the kind of I would like the Jim d'Owlrenple pants where you could probably put him
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.800]   I've had me in the back pocket
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.520]   But I it has been those the size of a credit card
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.880]   Yeah, it's just a little and you could put as many cards or as few as you want. Look at that
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:22.960]   Yeah, it's elastic so it just expires and all you do is you push up on the bottom the cards come out
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.040]   You can pinch it so that they fan and then you just pull out pull out the card that you want
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.360]   I drop cards all the time by accident. Is it pretty good at the grip on the card there?
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.200]   I have not dropped a single card and my old one because it was leather. It just stretched
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.560]   Yeah, I don't know if that's why I dropped on this, but uh, I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful at least Leo
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.880]   Which one did you get? Did you get the burnt titanium? Yes. Yeah, because it just sounded dope. It sounded so cool. It looks kind of dope
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.080]   Yeah, and again, the carbon fiber was really appealing and I might end up switching to that
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.640]   I thought it would be like I thought this might be too heavy, but it hasn't been and it's got a nice way to if ever have to throw
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.920]   It somebody had run real fast, but the carbon fiber is lighter
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.120]   Yeah, and of course doesn't set off a metal detector
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.520]   Yeah, so if you're like if you're wolf reind you're setting it off anyway, but for the rest of us maybe
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.800]   Adam and him is a bad thing to have in your body
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.040]   Uh, hmm
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.480]   And it was after you
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:16.720]   Yeah, you know, you don't even want to see my wallet
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.360]   Do you have a George Costanza? I have a Costanza
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.080]   Uh, and you're just trying to fit that last fortune
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.040]   Well, and what i've been doing is carrying like a minimalistic
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:31.120]   Number of cards like my driver's license in like one credit card and a hundred dollar bill in case I get lost
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.600]   Uh in uh in my phone
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.600]   If found please send back to me
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.560]   Is that is the yeah, but you can't carry I can't carry any much cash because it gets too fat
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:43.360]   I've heard of this thing called cash. Yeah, you know, you use in the last century
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:48.480]   Uh, I have a I have a conventional wallet and one of the reasons why I selected this one and not another one
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:56.000]   Is that it does have like a tiny little like purse on one side of it because I do need to carry one sd card
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.880]   Uh and a sim extraction tool because the number of times where i've left the house
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.840]   And only when i'm on like the commuter rail train realized oh
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:08.720]   Remember how you took pictures over the weekend and you took the card out of this camera and put it into the laptop
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.040]   And you never took it out of the laptop put it back in the camera
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.880]   Oh good at least i have a 60 i i'll have an emergency sd card and the only time i can find a
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.800]   Look at this sandy. I have so much crap
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:27.600]   I have two zippered pouches in my wallet. It's so fat. I have to have a little snap to snap it together
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.600]   Sorry three zippered pouches. That's where I keep the big bucks
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:36.000]   That is a lot of this is ridiculous to carry this around in your pot. It's a lot of functionality
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.880]   It's heavy functionality, but you're right, Andy. It's bad for your back bad for your back. Oh, Andy's getting his wallet. Let's compare wallets
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.440]   Okay. Yes. Yes, mine is but but look oh that's a castanza
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:52.560]   Okay, but this also this also can okay in my in my defense
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:58.800]   This also has like my moo cards in it the business cards from an event i went to business cards a while ago i haven't seen it out
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.800]   Well, a while i don't know
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:06.800]   But again, i'm not lying here is it needs to be i need to have that little purse i got that too
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.800]   Yeah, a little side thing
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:14.480]   I gotta say there you go. I got some six you guys okay. Yes. It is like it is like a person. I've got four sd
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:17.120]   I'm not that's kuku
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.280]   Also an led light
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.280]   USB light i have a few of those yeah, yeah
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:30.800]   The sim extraction tool. Oh, yeah, that's how my keychain on that one. Yeah, uh and a 128 gigabytes
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:34.080]   of usb storage, gerry handy you never know number times
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.760]   But i will tell you the number of times where i've been i'm like i've been in a situation away from the office like oh man
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.200]   I'm totally screwed. Oh wait a minute. I think i think i might
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200]   Did i still have 128 gigabytes of storage? Yes i do i do
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:54.560]   But yes i can all right so rich i have to try the ridge i don't know i don't know if you could turn this into a ridge wallet
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.640]   But i'm gonna try
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.640]   So you put the cash in the clip
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:05.040]   Yeah, i ran out because the local ice cream store finally reopened and they only took cash so why i am i emptied this out
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:11.280]   But um, yeah, you i just put the cash there in the little clip it works great. I might i might i might be picking one up
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:18.240]   I have a wallet fetish. I know right i got i bought this right after i ordered the one that fits your whole passport in it
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.280]   Yeah
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.640]   I have that too
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.480]   I know in fact when i travel i have a giant wallet because it's got a passport in it
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:31.040]   And it's got number a number of slots for different currencies and it's got a pen in it so you could fill out the yes customs form
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.720]   But they don't have customs form i have nexus and they don't we don't need customs
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:41.840]   Yeah, i'll say the only time that i feel like jason borne is when i empty out my wallet and clean it out and realize that i have
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:47.440]   I have functioning transit system cards for four us cities and two international cities
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:53.360]   It's not six different identity cards, but i ever go back to london
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.720]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.080]   Uh, well since we're on since we're on fashion with the ballets
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.240]   Uh, this is something that i've been holding off on recommending to make sure they actually liked it
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.440]   This is a pair of shoes i got of about a month ago called the zero xe
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:16.080]   And this is technically called a minimal like sneaker and it's called so because
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:22.480]   It's not as it's not like one of those shoes where it's like just like a glove and you have individual toe
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.520]   capsules that make you look horrible, but it is just a layer of canvas
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.960]   And a thin like layer of rubber on the bottom there
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:39.200]   Uh, and the idea being that it's the the design goal is to make it as as close to walking around barefoot as possible
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.120]   uh, and
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.120]   Uh, i'll tell you i'll tell you to i'll talk about it from two different perspectives
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.720]   Uh one perspective being the one that it was meant to serve
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.880]   And i'll say it really is kind of cool to be like walking around in the neighborhood
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.160]   And your feet you're you can feel the cracks in the sidewalk
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:03.600]   And you can feel like the textures of things you're walking on your your feet aren't like conforming to what the shoe your shoe is doing
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:07.120]   Uh, but nonetheless your feet are comfortable and they're being protected
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.520]   And they're also comfortable enough that i was at a we i get two-day street fair
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:18.080]   Uh over the weekend and i just okay i'll just wear these just see how well they work and they were completely comfortable my feet weren't sore at all
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.320]   Uh, they people who make shoes like these will tell you that you really see the problem
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.800]   The reason why people have like foot and leg and back problems is because their shoes are trying to make
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:32.160]   We were born to walk barefoot and when we do things go go off kilter when we're not walking barefoot
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.320]   I don't know anything about that. Uh, but they're really they are really really comfortable
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:43.200]   Uh, the other the other reasons that i bought them are one because sometimes i really i want to wear like really
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.600]   If they're really good for travel because they can just like squash into nothing
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.080]   And so you can have like an extra pair of shoes like in your bag because they're basically
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.640]   The size of a pair of slippers, but the other one is i think they're really good freelancer shoes
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:04.880]   Because it's like yeah, i mean i'm in the habit if i if like a day like today i'm going to be in the office all day
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.320]   And so yes, I still shower i still shave i still put on clean clothes
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:15.120]   But I might not wear shoes like for 30 hours and I will say that that leads to a certain lack of professionalism
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.560]   I feel as though if I if I actually have shoes on my feet
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:24.960]   Then I feel like i'm being a little bit more professional and also like if I have to answer the door to sign for a package or
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:31.440]   The the talk to a neighbor or go downstairs to pick up my mail. I don't feel like some sort of hillbilly
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.160]   Who doesn't who doesn't own a pair of shoes?
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.000]   So these are really they're like formal slippers. They're like structured slippers almost and yeah they're
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.240]   As a I
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.080]   I had a firm about a month
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.520]   There stood they were kind of weird feeling for the first day or two
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.480]   I felt like my toes are being like crammed into the toe box
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.880]   But they have a 30-day return policy so you can
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.800]   If you
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.920]   So long as they they're still kind of new if you feel like you're want to back out of this and get your 80 bucks back
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:06.960]   You can go you can send them back within 30 days. But yeah, I've been my the long-term thing is I've been sort of interchanging them with
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:12.720]   My regular sneakers and other shoes so that so that I'll give like my my regular
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.840]   New balance sneakers like sort of a day off every other day
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:21.280]   I'll make those last a lot longer and like I said it makes me feel like i'm having a little bit more of a formal
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:24.320]   Day even though i'm wearing basically a slipper
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:27.760]   They're available in like whims the level of women sizes
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.240]   They're also available in like more of a running shoes sort of look to them
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.120]   But for 80 bucks, I was willing to take a flood around them and they actually work out very very well
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:44.960]   So these are the hanas that you like hana. I think they the the women's version is called the lana. I think lina. I'm like that lina
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.320]   Yeah
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:51.440]   And uh, yeah, I'm gonna I might have to check these out because i'm always looking for something that I said pack up highly packable
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.720]   Yeah, and I could like like on all the on all the
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.400]   The cruises that you go on these would be like perfect for
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:04.320]   I'm on the boat. Yeah, exactly. I'll say again. It's summer. It's beautiful. It's like 88 degrees outside
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:09.440]   Like I've said before the war I moved it's so short on a really beautiful weekend
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.440]   There are all kinds of tourists down here
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:18.480]   And the idea of like working like in my office and looking down and seeing men my age in cargo shorts and like those
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:25.360]   And like sandals with no socks on has reminded me that I don't look good in shorts and sandals with no socks
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:30.880]   on but this will still but this still gives me the sort of walking around in a light comfortable like airy shoe
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:36.720]   Without people seeing how hairy my toes are and chalky bononi my new my toes are the
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.400]   zeros
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.080]   Xerro
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.080]   Shoes feel the world. They're actually they're on sale for 50 bucks
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:50.400]   Very recently. So if you're kind of on the edge just keep taking a look. They might go on sale again. Nice
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.960]   Okay, there here you go
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:58.240]   Two business cards from Steve was to steal business cards from Steve was yeah, there's his wallet folks
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.880]   By the way as Steve will point out
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:04.800]   Not only can you cut a stake with them. They also make a handy lock picking kit
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:08.800]   That's standing
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.680]   It just sounds like something Steve would do
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:17.920]   My friend did I by the way the chat room says I skipped you last week. Did I do that? Andy? I'm sorry
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:21.600]   Um, I think you might have I don't know but I didn't I
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.240]   Assume that I assume that we were we were late and I
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:28.720]   Have something sick. Yeah anytime that I skip you just say hey hey
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:34.560]   Hey, hey, so hey, so long as I get paid long enough getting paid not being paid by the word
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:37.360]   I can say yeah
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.840]   Mr. Alex Lindsey
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.760]   So we were talking about spotify and I was talking about the fact that I make a lot of playlists
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:46.800]   And I finally decided to publish one. So I figured I would
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:49.920]   Renee said oh you should publish one and so I was like, okay
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:55.760]   So I published my it's on my twitter feed actually, but uh, I was put a link in here
[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:58.560]   But a l-e-x l-i-n-d-s-a
[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:04.080]   Why yeah, and it's um, it's a summer mix. It's a good summer pool mix. Alex is summer mix quite happy with it
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:08.160]   I'm constantly working on it. So the stuff at the very end is stuff that I've just added
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.880]   I haven't figured out where to put it yet. So it's not um, you know
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:16.240]   Because I'm often thinking about what songs should come after the next song and how I should look but but right now it's uh
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:23.120]   Um, people don't know that Alex was a dj for many many years and then before that I made all I did
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:25.760]   A large portion of my childhood was making
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.160]   Mixtape's so so that's what we called them kids. Yeah from the time I was like 10 years old
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.200]   We were making him off the I used to make mixtapes off the radio
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.240]   Like you wait
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.560]   It was like first course first 10 seconds was cut off because I was like adding you know
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.840]   Hitting record on waiting for the next song that I wanted to play and then my cousins would sit around and and I would sit around with albums and
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.720]   Make them and and so it's just kind of a nice groovy. It it ranges all over the world. Uh, some classic rock some
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:57.600]   Uh, you know, brazilian african alternative so it's it's kind of this wide ranging thing and some of its inputs
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.080]   You know the jus and timbre like is mostly inputs for my daughter
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.040]   Likes that song so and rude. I don't know that song very well, but i'm learning i'm learning to like it
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:07.360]   so anyway, there's a lot of um
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.480]   A lot of fun there to be had if you're if it's mostly designed if you're hanging out at the pool or outside
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.200]   You just want something that's kind of groovy that plays for 10 and a half hours
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:22.400]   So I like I like I wanted to be able to play all all day
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:30.240]   Anyway, so very nice very if people like it. I'll make I have more. I don't need to make more I have got
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.000]   200 playlists on Spotify. I don't uh
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.920]   I didn't put it on apple music because building playlists on apple music is really
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.240]   A pain. Yes, you know like you can't I couldn't find even where to do it on the desktop and you in spot
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:46.320]   I don't build any playlists on
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.280]   On my iOS app so I just build them on the on the desktop because it's too slow to do it on the daps
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:53.520]   You can do it really fast on
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:58.080]   On the desktop. So anyway, um, so that's why it's not on apple music. I'm trying to port it over
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.640]   There's like I did a I did a song swap or whatever, but there's like 14 songs missing
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.720]   I have to figure out where they are and an apple music and re-add them. I don't know what happened
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.520]   Anyway, so enjoy uh, it's it's still the summer so you can
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.840]   In half the world at least so you can do that. Otherwise, it's great win or mix
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.760]   I'm just buying some zero shoes. Don't mind. There you go
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.760]   Alex if if you if you are a believer
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:29.360]   We would still love you anyway. We we believe you when you say it's your kids. Is there some in there?
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.440]   believer
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.200]   Can you is there a way to export a spotify play so I can use it on apple music
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:41.360]   Well, I use the the app I guess I get to talk about that too the app that I use to move things around is called
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.240]   song shift on the i on my phone
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.280]   So song shift will ask for permission from spotify and ask permission from apple music
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:55.200]   And then uh, and then it just pushes them, but it usually doesn't it's usually not 100 for whatever reason it
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:58.400]   There's like there's always like 10 or 15 songs that for some reason don't
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.040]   Make it from one side to the other and you have to go through by hand
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.560]   They're named slightly differently or something else and so um, but it
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:08.800]   It's been the most effective one that I've I've had I don't you know, I just use it on my phone. Nice
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:12.560]   So download is there is there a way I could get your
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:16.960]   Playlist if I don't I could use a free spotify download it and put it in my yeah
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:23.120]   And I'm gonna put as soon as I finish fixing the music I I uh, I kind of just did it on a whim
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:30.320]   um to post it uh and uh, so I'm gonna post the apple music one on my twitter feed as well that I just have to uh
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:36.880]   Let me show you something you could use on your twitter feed. This is so cool itty.bitty.site
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.320]   S-I-T-E
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:41.680]   Let's you make a web page is entirely encoded in the url
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.640]   So you could do alex's
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:47.360]   spotify
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.360]   playlist
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:56.080]   One two three four five, you know like that all of that stuff you could post a qr code
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.640]   Which would actually link to that site or you could post the url
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:03.920]   Copy the link and share it via twitter
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.840]   It's encoded in a very long url, but twitter all shortened it
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.040]   And then when people click the link they go to this site at itty.bitty.site
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:17.760]   Is that wild that's cool. You can even do html you can even do scripting so
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:24.000]   Folks you should make sure you're going to a site your trust from a person you love and that cast your love from a person you trust
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.760]   My pick of the week besides itty.bitty.site
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.000]   Which is pretty cool. You don't even need a web host or anything just
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.400]   Uh, it's not even on their host. It's just I don't know how it works. It's magic
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:44.960]   Is this interview with Andy Hertzfeld now? We've interviewed bill Atkinson many times and I love bill and Andy they are the creators of the original mac and tosh
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.600]   Of course
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.680]   Bill created the lisa before it and he talks about that and talks about the process in an interview
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:57.360]   uh in a notion.so
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:00.560]   With a woman named Devin who is a developer
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:06.640]   And it's great highly recommend it. There's a youtube video or a video. I should say I guess that's a youtube video
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.680]   Yeah
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.600]   That you could watch notions tools and craft an interview with Andy Hertzfeld or
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.680]   Yeah, actually just go to notion.so and you can do it there too
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:20.080]   But I think really kind of neat I want to celebrate this guy because he's a hero of mine
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:24.480]   And one of the sweetest guys i've ever met i'm sure you guys have also met uh Andy
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.920]   But um, it's been a real honor to get to know bill Atkinson
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:33.120]   Maybe we could try to get uh Andy on at some point too. She also throws in some pictures of his house
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.840]   A corner of Andy's house
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:41.360]   So that's kind of fun. That's kind of fun to see what look what Andy let's see what Andy's reading right, you know
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.120]   Zoom in on his books
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.520]   What is Andy? What is Andy reading these days?
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.520]   so
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:52.160]   notion.so nice job Devin on on these interviews and uh
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:56.000]   And I just want to let everybody know about it because that's really really cool
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have now concluded our broadcast today at least as as regards to apple

[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:10.960]   You probably have that muscle memory and Alex can i ask you a question
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:16.640]   If you if you were getting getting older looking would we ever know if so long as it was on video
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.600]   Oh, that's a good point
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:27.200]   That's a good point. You know, i'm just gonna start working like motion tracking dots on your face everywhere so you can optimize later
