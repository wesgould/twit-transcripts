[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Today is a special day.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Finally no more rumors, facts. Andy Naco's here from the Chicago.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Formerly of these are...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I've said it for so many years of the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Formerly.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Formerly. Now of Naco.com.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And soon of somewhere interesting you said an announcement sometime after WWDC.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Well, okay, technically this is after WWDC, but I'm going to use the Apple like Mac Pro
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   slash HomePod that technically speaking, if I say late 2018, I haven't until December 31st.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You have till the end of the week.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Before the ball drops.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Always a pleasure. Thank you, Andy. Renee is at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Couldn't join us today, but he sent in his place, Michael Sargent, from Imor.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Actually from Mobile Nations as well as Imor. It's great to have you, Micah.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah, good to be here. Yeah.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I am no Renee Richie, but I will do my best. Let me tell you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm thrilled to have you.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So Imor sent everybody, but I guess you got left out, huh?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Imor sent Serenity and Renee, and we have a person who lives in California.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Our dear friend, Lori Gill.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Lori's great. She was there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Isn't she? She's fantastic.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So the three of them are there in person. I got to go.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I think it was two years ago, and it was a lot of fun.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   But yeah, this time I was working comfortably from my office, making it happen here.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I would love to go as a developer, not as a journalist.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I have to say, yesterday's keynote, while there was a lot of interesting things there,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   it didn't feel like to me it merited a keynote.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It was like, you could have phoned this one in.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I mean, that's true, but the thing is, this always has been a developer keynote.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It basically means that Apple really did spend the last couple of years getting all kinds of hardware out the door.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And right now, given the magnitude of a lot of the things that they were talking about,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   like again, like actually seeing confirmation of Marsapan about some sort of code sharing in development between iOS and MacOS.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   iOS is UI kit being ported over to Mac and an app being able to rely on both and being able to basically build an iOS app that will also function really well as a MacOS app.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's pretty huge.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Addressing speed and stability, that's no need.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's no small trick. The fact that they were quoting the keynote guy because I have not installed the beta on my iPhone 5s yet,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   but the idea of having a phone as old as the iPhone 5s and not only retaining compatibility,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   but also having performance enhancements, I know they're mentioning the iPhone 6,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   but since I've spoken to people who've installed it on older hardware and for them,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   it's a reason to take this phone out of the drawer from a stereo in your lineup of previous purchases,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   too. Maybe I can actually use this as a smaller iPhone now because it's so fast.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So they're a lot of... So yeah, it's not so they didn't have a whole lot to announce.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's just that not a whole lot of it was consumer facing, I think.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah, and I'm okay with that.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Honestly, when Tim Cook took the stage and said this is an event all about software,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I kind of had a little cheer within myself.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I guess being a nerd have always been super into the software stuff.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And this is the time when I get to hop into developer.apple.com and like pour over that documentation
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and dig into it and see what's new and get excited.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And like Friday, they're going to have a deep dive into HomeKit that I'm really looking forward to
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and to focus completely on software and introduce all these new, well, all of these new features and fixes.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I think this is going to be great because we see people griping and complaining and shouting
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and begging that Apple will finally focus on getting things running stably.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And then when it actually happens, it seems like a lot of people are going,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "But where's the hardware?" And I'm okay that they didn't have it this time.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, thank goodness Mark Gurman warned us.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Right?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Right?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   We knew that there wasn't going to be any hardware.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So there was no excuse to be upset by the lack of hardware.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Although, let's not forget that they announced new hardware past couple of WWDCs.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And it didn't go really well.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It's about the house, the HomePod, right?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And they didn't ship that for another eight months.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They announced the iMac Pro, which came out fairly quickly after that last year.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   They did announce a lot of software for the HomePod, like AirPlay 2, iCloud messages that didn't come out until last week.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   They managed to get it in before the next WWDC, but that was really down to the wire.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   My favorite thing though, I have to say, I really enjoyed it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I think it was Stephen Fry narrating it.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The video they showed it to me.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Can I just show a little of the developer?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They call this the developer migration.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Northern California's Bay Area.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Actually, I want to pause this for a second.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   What the hell aspect ratio is that?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   That's definitely like, Cinerama or Vistavision.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That was one.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Apple's great because Samsung with their keynotes will do very splashy things like have a screen on the stage as well as behind them.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But Apple did something that they didn't really highlight in any way.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And yet it was amazing, which was the screen stretched the entire width of the stage at the McHenry Convention Center.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That is really wide.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Do you think this is a standard aspect ratio?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   No, I think this is Apple being able to build in the Steve Jobs Theater any screen of any resolution.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Like 52 to 9.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   When they have an 8K screen up there, they can basically, they want a banana shaped screen that goes from left to right.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   They can do that.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Let me start continuing on, but this is a view of the highway 280 heading down to Cupertino from San Francisco.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It's a beautiful shot.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You have my audio?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   [music]
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Every year a great migration is made by one of the world's most mysterious species.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   To reach this utopian destination, these unique mammals will instinctively embark on a dramatic journey from all corners of the world.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   To me this was literally the highlight.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   This is the developer's triterapsis.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Or as it is more commonly known.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Standby for the developer.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Jim Dalrym will appear in soon.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [music]
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   11 and a half months of hibernation has taken its toll.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And the sun is harsh as these nocturnal cave dwelling creatures must greet daylight.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   For most, this momentous migration is there first.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It comes with you.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   While there is select few, the pilgrimage is a time-of-tradition.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now, I got to ask Jim, did they film, they must have filmed this?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I'm curious.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Well, that's the event.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That looks like a previous WWDC jacket, doesn't it?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Oh, maybe that's what it is.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Though it's probably stock footage.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Or they called Jim and he lives in the area and said he certainly has last year's jacket.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I mean, they're all wearing the old jackets.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I mean, that's part of it is the old pick.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I think it was back at like 108 Leo.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Thanks.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You actually know the time code?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   No, no, no.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I saw you scooted up.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I scooted a great distance.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   He does operate the Jim Dallerimple fan page.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Do you really?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   No, no, no.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So it's not just an old WWDC jacket.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   He's got Lee Old Mac OS icon underneath.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Back when we proudly capitalize the M and Mac OS.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Anyway, if you haven't seen it, go back and watch our coverage of the keynote from yesterday
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   or Apple's video.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.840]   They actually posted this on YouTube as well as the it's called a developer migration.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.680]   And man, is that it's just a great take off on David Attenborough and the BBC Planet and
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   all that.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   Exactly.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.920]   I think it was from the BBC like Planet Earth documentary.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   Yeah, that's how it felt.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.120]   It felt like it felt like it.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   And that was Fry doing his best David Attenborough.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   I don't really.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   I don't think so.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.120]   It didn't sound like him.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   You don't think it was Fry?
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.560]   You don't think it's David Fry or you don't think it's a good David Attenborough.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.440]   If you hire Stephen Fry, you're hiring to get Stephen Fry voice, not the David Attenborough
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   voice.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   Listen, listen, let me see women.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   No, I'm curious.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.800]   I'm originating the remote garages of Silicon Valley.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.240]   Yeah, maybe not.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.920]   Evolved at an unprecedented speed to understand how we must observe them here.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.120]   All Brits sound the same.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.000]   Serenity mistakenly tweeted it was Anthony Hopkins.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.480]   She said, that's what I get for listening to the people behind me.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.080]   Well, remember what I said?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.320]   I've been getting some voice-offs.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   And voice-over opportunities.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   It's actually me that's.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   It's my cicargent.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.400]   I won't do the impression here because I'm under certain yeas.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   It's not Fry.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Okay.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   All right.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Everybody comes up.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   It's not Fry.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   All right.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.280]   But a casting agent said, get me a cheaper Stephen Fry, the first name.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   That's the answer.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   Get me my cicargent.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:09.640]   So I have to say, the thing that most encouraged me was that Apple clear, you know, the finder
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.600]   has been neglected for years in Mac OS.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.720]   I mean, truly neglected.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.120]   They finally kind of cleaned it up a few versions ago.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.400]   But there haven't really been any improvements to finder.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.280]   This for the first time ever, they're really showing the finder some love in Mac OS.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.600]   And I found that encouraging because it's anything, frankly, any effort put into the
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   Mac makes me happy.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   I was very impressed.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.880]   Let's take a look at Mojave.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.800]   That's what the code name will be for the next Mac OS.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.120]   And should we bother that this is their named after the arid desert where no new life will
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.320]   ever spring from again.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.480]   The dunes are ready to die.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.840]   And to regret ever having entered this realm.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.040]   Or say, God, those dunes are pretty.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440]   One of the things this dunes show is that somehow, I'm not sure if this is a live desktop
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.600]   or something that you can have the Mac change during the through the day.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   Yes.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   Which is kind of interesting.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   Dark mode is.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   I was surprised by how much how much people love dark mode.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.400]   How excited I am about getting dark mode.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.800]   Yeah, you know, it's one of the notes app though.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   Well, we'll get there.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   Hold on.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.640]   One of the things that seems very, you know, trivial.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   And yet you're right.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   This is, but part of it is every other operating system I've ever used, you can customize the
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.560]   look of the operating system.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.720]   You know, you could change the colors.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.520]   You can make it dark if you want.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.360]   Apple's the only company ever that's really locked it down, you know, the menu fonts, the
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   menu font.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.760]   You know, you have a switch.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.200]   You could turn transparency on or off in the menu bar.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   That's it.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.520]   So it is a big deal that they finally have themed the desktop and you can have light or
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.280]   you can have dark.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.320]   But dark for photographers is actually a great look.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.920]   You don't like the the notepad?
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   The notes app.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.000]   It has a dark texture in the background.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.480]   So you know how the notes app is textured in Mac OS right now with that weird sort of
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.040]   trying to look like paper texture?
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.520]   Well, the dark version, I think it was Steven Hackett on Twitter who said it looks like
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   old oatmeal and it really does look like this very dark oatmeal.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.320]   You can never unsee it.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.840]   Oh, yeah, it's bad.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   It's bad.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.400]   I just wish they'd get rid of that texture because I like dark mode and I've been playing
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.800]   around with it a little bit and it's it's looks good for most of the apps.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.000]   But with notes, I'm like, can you just not have the texture?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I don't understand.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   So you've installed or did you have the beta on before?
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.640]   No, I installed it on an external SSD.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   Is it a public beta or you have to be a developer to get it?
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.160]   Yeah, you have to be you have to have a developer account and everything to use it.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   So yes, it's not.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   How stable is it?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   Feel pretty stable?
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.320]   I didn't really do anything other than get it started.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.520]   I will say, and I know we're not there yet, but whenever we do get there, like the people
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.720]   have been talking up the stability of these different betas in comparison with beta ones
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   in the past.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.080]   So that's been interesting to see.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.200]   I might consider installing it.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.920]   I do like to have so one of the things dark mode will appear to will appear to appeal to
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   is photographers and movie video editors.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.760]   I mean, that's really what you want.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.120]   And of course apps, including Final Cut have had dark mode forever, but I like it on the
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.800]   desktop too, especially with the new dark iMac Pro.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.840]   I think that's going to look pretty sweet.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.600]   I think anytime I get the chance to turn on dark mode in something, I use the official
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   Twitter app.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   I've used it for years.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   I always go dark.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.560]   And I yeah, dark mode because the strain of those bright pages on my eyes is not fun,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.280]   but with dark mode, it sort of cuts that back.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:56.760]   And so that's nice that like now if I launch Adobe apps in Mac OS, they look the same as
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Final Cut that looks the same as notes, it looks the same as Xcode, et cetera.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.520]   Having that all go dark is really nice.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.160]   And you know, Apple, they didn't make it.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.560]   I covered the state of the union and they were talking about developers, you know, adding
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.600]   dark mode to their apps.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.200]   It's not something that's auto automatically turned on.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.560]   You do have to go in and make some adjustments.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.760]   But if you're following best practices as a developer who makes a Mac OS app, it is very
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   simple.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   Well, I shouldn't say that.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.440]   It's quite simple to make the changes.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.760]   You just add dark variants for your different assets and you go in and you specify dark
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   colors.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.120]   And so depending on how much custom stuff you've done in your app and how much you're following
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.840]   best practices, that could be as little as a day of updates to make your app compatible
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.920]   for dark mode.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.480]   Yes, it's theming.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   Yes, exactly.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   You just theme the components.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.560]   Look, you get a hold one or zero choice.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.320]   Yeah, that's what Lisa's got.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.760]   What's the joke I made is how hard is this feature to add?
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.080]   You just, you just, you just flip a bit and suddenly everything's dark.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.000]   No, I think it's a little more complicated.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.520]   It's really like theme, it's theming.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:17.240]   That custom assets, like the example that they used was the sort of planetary app and the
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.800]   earth in the lighter mode was a lot brighter.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.720]   But for the dark mode, they wanted to do an earth that sort of looked like the sun was
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   on the other side of the globe, essentially.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.080]   And so they made a darker asset for that and some of the other components did.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:39.840]   And they showed how a lot of your light assets and your light UI elements don't really blend
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.680]   and look good in that darker mode.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.600]   And sometimes the typefaces can be, the color of the type can really throw things off.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.040]   So yeah, it's theming.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.880]   And once you get it there, then it's very easy.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.080]   And like I said, they've made it simple for developers to switch between the modes whenever
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.480]   you're debugging.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:02.240]   And so it's quite simple to see how that works along with accessibility modes like high contrast.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.000]   Well you know the developers, they've been living in a cave for the last 12 minutes.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.040]   Without their dark mode for so long, how did they do it?
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.160]   Definitely when we updated the Twitch website, we don't have a white page, but we have a
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   very light page.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.560]   And a lot of people complain, they say, "It hurts my eyes!"
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.880]   It's like, "Dude, turn your monitor down, okay?"
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.400]   So the biggest, I think the thing that's really exciting to me is that they have built into
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:38.440]   the, essentially built into the preview a much more functional interface that lets you do
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.400]   all sorts of interesting things.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.000]   And I feel like this is in a way, this is what a number of companies have been talking
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.760]   about for several decades, the idea of a document centric operating system.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   Instead of how it is really on Windows and Mac and has never, has always been and never
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:04.040]   changed is you have a file system that organizes hierarchically, organizes documents and you
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.480]   have separately installed applications.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.360]   And if you want to work on something, you have to open an application and then open the
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.240]   document or double click the document which opens the application and opens the document.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.680]   And then you can work on it.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.120]   And it's a very modal, it's a very, actually really not an happily way of doing things.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:26.080]   And I know that Alan Kay, when he first conceived of the Dina book and even back to Xerox
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.880]   Park, there was always this notion of how can we make it more document centric where
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   you don't have to open something to modify something.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.960]   And I'm thrilled to see that A, that Apple's put money into the Finder and the Finder team's
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   working on it.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.920]   And they're actually starting to get there in a very sensible way.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.400]   So it says with OS, back OS Mojave, the Finder becomes even more of a doer.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.360]   That's a good way to describe it.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.760]   It's not just for finding files anymore, right?
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   Yeah, they've added a lot of meat there.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.480]   It's sort of like a super version of quick look.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.200]   And it's certain that but now it's more like a first level equality view with all the other
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.880]   views you've got in the Finder, adding a sidebar for related information.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.240]   And of course, they're mostly talking about media during the keynote.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.440]   Yeah, when you're talking metadata, it's more like the stuff that you'd see in photos
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   or light rooms.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   Exactly.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440]   Like XF data.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.920]   But what really got me was the idea of having quick actions.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.560]   So now that when you have a Word doc, you're not only getting information about the doc,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.000]   you're not only getting a preview of it, but you could also get this little row of context
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   aware icons of things you can do with it.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.680]   And the idea that these are actions you can actually create with Automator.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.200]   So for instance, that's real vindication for Sal, who was let go a couple of years ago.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.440]   They should have someone on staff to do stuff like that.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:59.200]   Yeah, just think about all the things that I miss about the stagnation about the Mac
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.120]   versus all the adulation that Apple pays towards iOS is that one of the barriers between
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.560]   one of the things that defines Mac OS versus iOS is, or should be, for me, the ability
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.240]   to customize, the ability to make this Mac my own.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.440]   And one of the tasks I'm always doing is there's no automatic organization of files that really
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.080]   works for me because I tend to download things into a folder, right, tend to save something
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.560]   where I think it will logically go.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.400]   And then once every couple of weeks or so, I have to go through this folder and figure
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.840]   out where things have to go.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.400]   But it would be very, very easy for me to just put, but create Automator actions.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.040]   So I can just, again, use this, use this preview and then just click about, okay, that
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.360]   one needs to go to my server and then delete the original.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.520]   That one actually keep in keeping documents.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.840]   That one move into the documents folder, but also back it up to Dropbox, all these things
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   so I can just for my specific tasks.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.200]   And so when people start, it might encourage, I hope people to create third party actions
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.760]   that will basically take things that are too many steps, but don't have to be too many
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   steps and making them just like part of your own experience.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.280]   I am so pumped about this.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.760]   Again, during the state of the union, they went a little bit more in depth on this and
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.000]   the little my little nerd heart let whenever they talked about being able to create custom
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.240]   quick actions using AppleScript and using Automator because I already was creating different
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   Automator workflows for resizing images and cropping them and doing things like that.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.680]   And so to have that built into Finder now, Leo, as you mentioned, to give us all of these
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.400]   possibilities to act directly on files instead of having to sort of go to these other places
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.960]   and then be able to adjust those files.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.720]   I am so pumped for this.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:54.280]   And in fact, that was one of the main reasons that I wanted to download the beta and start
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.720]   using it was so I could start tinkering around with some workflow quick actions or some Automator.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.160]   I think what would be really interesting if Apple, this may be what's happening.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.760]   You know, at one point, for Federighi said, people keep asking us if we're going to merge
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.040]   Mac OS and iOS.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:18.520]   And the answer is in this big keynote style drop in of the no boom.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.720]   And then immediately thereafter, they talk about Marzipan and how you're going to put
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.920]   iOS apps on the desktop.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   But we know it's touching.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.880]   But what I would love to see when I think this might be an indicator that they are heading
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:39.160]   towards this is, all right, let's just acknowledge that the Macintosh is a niche product for professionals.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.600]   Let's make it powerful.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.920]   Let's let's acknowledge the pros use Apple script and Automator and they want to do that kind of thing.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.880]   Let's let's say we don't have to make this easy to use.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.080]   What if we didn't have the constraint?
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.360]   This has to be for normal people.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.720]   Let them use the iPad.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.080]   Let's make this powerful.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.200]   You don't like that?
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:04.520]   Well, no, I just I think that I saw nothing in the keynote that made me optimistic that
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.000]   that Apple will still be supporting consumer level Macs after the next two years.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.960]   No, I agree with you.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.600]   I agree with you.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.240]   It is it.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.000]   I so that's why I don't I don't think they're emerging.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.600]   I think that would that would indicate that that Apple wants a device that combines the Mac and iOS.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.640]   I think they want to take everybody with using Mac.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.080]   I think Craig, Craig Federighi is being disingenuous by raising that question.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.600]   Nobody's asking that question.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.280]   The question everybody's asking is, are you going to make Macs at all?
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.560]   Nobody's asking, are you going to merge Mac OS and iOS?
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.920]   Nobody cares about that.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.760]   So they answering the wrong question.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.640]   Yeah, I mean, we're going to be talking about iOS later, but compare the really huge changes they
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:49.320]   made to really huge improvements that they made to iOS and also the changes the improvements that
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.760]   were either on the bingo card at the end of the keynote or stuff that were at the at the talk
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.800]   afterward or things are going to be coming out a little bit later on this week and compare that
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.920]   to all the the little tweaks as usual.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.600]   They kind of added to the Mac.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.560]   The stacks are nice.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.680]   I love the preview.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.600]   Tell me about the steps because we were talking about you talked about how your file
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.920]   organization isn't well supported by finder.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.040]   Yeah, I have is desk is in instead of and you see everybody knows somebody who has just their
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.560]   entire desktop is covered with icons like that's all that's there.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.040]   Right.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:28.200]   I might be my most deeply nested folder is a folder on my desktop called tidy desktop
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   because then when they're like a million screenshots on this thing,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.240]   he's just trying to do that.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.480]   I will then like create a rename it tidy desktop June 2018 and then drag it to
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.920]   that folder.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   And so they're nested and nested and nested.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:49.320]   So stacks is pretty cool because oh, oh, by the way, I found out that if you if you if you dive into
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.000]   the beta a little bit, now you can actually choose where screenshots go.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.600]   They don't necessarily go to the desk.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   Which is nice feature.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.240]   The thing is for two or three years, but okay.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.000]   So but but stacks now when you put things on the desktop, they are the desktop will automatically
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.640]   organize them into like a pile of word docs and a pile of JPEGs and a pile of Photoshop docs.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.280]   And you can you can basically expand the stack and grab something out of it.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.200]   You can scrub through it left and right.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.440]   So and even if you and whenever you it's not even like a clean desktop sort of operation,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.800]   just keeps those keeps things in the stacks automatically.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.520]   And they look pretty cool.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.640]   So we've been hearing about stacks as one of those like background rumors back of the drawer
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.080]   features that they've been working on or having they've been planning on for years.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.520]   And actually I had completely forgotten about stacks until God mentioned the keynote finally.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:47.720]   So congratulations to everybody from 2004 through today who might have contributed code to the
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.840]   stacks feature.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.080]   Nice to see that finally hit the light of day.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:58.840]   So you don't sound like you share my excitement that they're putting some love into the finder.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:04.040]   Like I don't feel like that's a that's a bellwether for the Macintosh.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.800]   When you know it's it's you know it's it's like when
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:15.160]   if you're if you're used to like your your parents cooking you frozen pizza every single night
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.120]   and suddenly they order pizza out and you're excited because wow we got delivery pizza
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.400]   and it's still not like actual cooked food but hey at least we're getting better than the
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.800]   higher level of crap the usual.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.920]   Again it's nice that they've added some features to the finder but it still concerns me every
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.240]   time I see that oh great okay great they're demonstrating the new because we're gonna still
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.920]   call it Mars a pan but then the new like cross platform built app building.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.080]   So now we've got the news app and now we've got the home app but again these are iOS
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.600]   apps that as far as I've been able to see haven't really been improved or expanded beyond what they
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.280]   do on iOS. We're seeing things like system updates are no longer going to be handled to the app store
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.960]   they're going to be handled through system preferences which actually makes more sense but
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.440]   again this is another chance in their case of let's make the Mac look a lot more like iOS.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.320]   So I was actually thinking about thinking about that this morning and I mean literally I'm just
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.040]   like going through my list of after all my notes about my first hand experiences and the videos
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.600]   and everything I've been reading it's like I don't know whether Apple is trying to encourage
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.920]   iOS developers to become Mac OS developers as well or whether they're trying to make Mac users
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.880]   basically training them to become iOS users without them really knowing it so that in two or three
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:37.560]   years time when they come out with the higher level of iOS device that can really replace
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.200]   everything that a Mac does they feel as though they're just stepping off of one boat and onto a dock
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.600]   as opposed to having to flail around in the water while they swim to this new destination.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.880]   I don't I'm just not satisfied that Apple still cares about Macs for consumers.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.680]   I've seen anything to the degree that you know instead of paying attention what they say but what
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:05.160]   they do you're right I mean they they there's no love for the Mac at all I mean they haven't updated
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.280]   the hardware now in more than a year in some cases five years so I mean my Mac Pro is five years
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:19.320]   superannuated it's five years old I'm using a 2015 Mac book Pro I mean I have the iMac Pro but
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.480]   that's that's just one product and I and I you know and by the way as long as we're talking about
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.560]   that I'll get back to Mac OS in a second we were talking on Sunday about why Apple might not have
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   done the new Mac books and Greg Ferro made an excellent point which is that Intel's not producing
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.840]   these new coffee like chips in sufficient quantity for Apple that there really is an Intel problem
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.320]   and I have to admit Apple is really hampered I understand why Apple's rattling the cage is about
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:54.280]   let's do arm on desktop because Intel's just having struggling but Intel does have a and I was I was
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.120]   really crossing my fingers you know my dream would be a new Mac book Pro with the new Intel i9
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:08.200]   hex core six-core processor with Optane memory Optane SSDs you know something with a decent keyboard
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.480]   and some maybe even some ports that would be an amazing product that I would get excited about
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.960]   other companies are doing that Dell's gonna do that HP is doing it who else announced today
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.640]   oh ASUS announced Optane based and iN based laptops but in every case I think it's because
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.800]   they only and Greg said well they only need 20,000 they don't need millions and Apple needs millions
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.080]   so that kind of makes sense to me maybe that's what Apple's waiting for is quantity production
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:44.040]   of these i9 chips that would make sense yeah that doesn't but still that they as I've said before
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.000]   they've shown the power to completely change everything they do if it's a goal that they think
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.880]   or they yeah I don't think that this represents an insurmountable hurdle for them again I don't
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   think it's smoking gun but I think that if they if if they had if they had CPU problems with
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.280]   ios devices we would never hear about it it would have been solved solved solved so damn quick yeah
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.320]   there's too much yeah iOS not to yeah so i've been up and again if they're still selling a lot of
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.880]   Macs particularly because they're the only manufacturer of them it's the one of the only
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.600]   desktop and notebook series that's actually showing like improvement again because it's really a
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.080]   single source problem but like I said I would like to see more science there's there's just
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.880]   nothing in even Mojave that makes me think this is an advanced operating system built by people who
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.320]   grew up grew up with like touch bars and excuse me touch pads and touch screens people who are
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.640]   willing to take the desktop into the next level as opposed to people who wish that their Mac were
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.360]   more ios like yeah all right you've broken my heart Andy but okay we'll move on then my job is done
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:57.320]   oh right time is over now i'm over here still being excited about it with you i can't i know
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.560]   and by the way if you want to get involved in the beta thank you scooter x uh the public beta
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:11.080]   for all of the new ios ios is will be out later this month and so you can go to beta.apple.com
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:20.120]   and enroll and uh so there you go so enroll your Mac and uh you will get it the minute uh
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.080]   it's allowed although they do say back it up first
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:30.120]   uh actually it looks like i can get into the public beta now download the macOS public beta
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:35.400]   access utility should i install it on the surface studio yeah do damn i wish i could let us know
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:43.560]   how that goes i wish i could i have actually actively considered hacking tashing a laptop just to
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.080]   just to get at macOS and some better hardware yeah that's just yeah it does it doesn't work out
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.240]   it doesn't work out well it's on it i had i had a hackintosh notebook for a while
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.720]   and it was very very nice this is before the iPad and it was like it was actually like a
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:05.160]   again a tiny tiny little hb uh hb win book and it was cool but it was more of a proof of concept
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:13.080]   anything else but it's the thing the there there's one thing that i'm that i'm still kind of following
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:19.560]   that uh the the the announcement that uh they're going to need uh there's going to be this new
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.080]   thing called notarized apps they're adding an enhancement to gatekeeper so that uh right right
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.680]   now there's you get to choose as a mac user you get to choose the level of security and where you
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.560]   where you trust to get your apps from you can say no just only let me install stuff from the app store
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:41.960]   or you can say only let me install install app store stuff or apps that are from a third party
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.840]   not from the app store but they've been signed by a known developer and if you want to just say i
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.120]   just come i just got this thing off of github is somewhere i yes you can i will warn you about it
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.480]   and i will try to stop you from doing that but if you want to do it we will let you do it now they
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.120]   have this thing called notarized apps where uh i don't understand it completely there's going to be a
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.160]   session at wwc later on today about it that i'm that i hope i see the life hope i see the stream
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.240]   because uh so apple is not going to is apple's plan as i understand it is to have this new
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:18.920]   new level where it's uh it's still like an unsigned unauthored app but apple has
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:25.480]   done some sort of automatic screening on it and no to quote notarized it not to not for content but
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:31.320]   just to make sure there's no known malware in it and that in future and they seem to have said
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   that in future editions of mac OS the mac OS will not even be able to run non-notarized apps so
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.520]   unless at some point apple has not good oh that's not good oh that's not good oh that's not good
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.240]   and i'm and i'm saying that it is it does sound like a drastic step so i might have gotten it wrong
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.280]   this is just me like talking to people who are there who have talked to other people and reading
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.680]   other announcements but this is what this is what i was so afraid of when they announced the app store
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.600]   is that at some point they would close the door on web web downloads and i understand from a security
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.960]   point of view that's a good thing but it's not a good thing from a developer point of view from
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:09.240]   my point of view i want to write apps that i can run on my own desktop for right now.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.360]   So they brought this up during the state of the union um and went into more detail so this uh
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:21.560]   notarized apps are an extension of the developer id program and so what you do is you you basically
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.120]   with your developer id you update it or you upload it it gets notarized and then when someone
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.880]   installs it then it sort of checks against that notoriety and the point of it right now is to
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:38.040]   block malware before it gets distributed and sort of apps that get signed uh or apps that get you
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.280]   know bad code injected maybe there are certain like versions of them that are bad but it's not
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:48.920]   all bad then this gives apple the ability to do sort of finer grain revocation but the problem is
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.480]   and they were very clear like this is not app review this is just making sure that apps are you
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.760]   know are analyzed for security purposes but here's the problem and Andy you are correct
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.120]   they said in the in the state of the union that future versions of Mac OS will require all apps
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.880]   to be notarized before they can be installed and i was so upset i'm it's if they do that i have i
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:17.080]   can't use the Mac anymore period i think that idea this is an example this is an example and
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.320]   apple and i bugs the hell out of me apple will use a public good a verifiable public good yes it's
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.960]   more secure to justify something that is ultimately in their commercial interest
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:34.760]   that's really frustrating to me yeah what what i don't like is that it's just the principle of
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.240]   the thing that i've spent two thousand dollars for this notebook i get to run whatever the hell
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:45.720]   i want on it you don't get to tell me that don't worry yeah we know we're so much smarter than we
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:51.000]   know you want you'll do stupid things we're here to make sure that you don't drown in that puddle
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.680]   which is why we're going to make sure you wear water wings wherever well that's
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.480]   raining outside and that's you go outside that's the exact opposite of what i was hoping for which is
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.320]   all right we're going to assume the Mac desktop is for people to know what they're doing their pros
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:10.280]   they want more power let the eye let let you you nanny all you want on the iOS platform don't
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.960]   nanny me on the Mac OS no i i don't i don't understand this the problem that it solves i always thought
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.000]   that one of the most elegant ways apple has ever implemented any features how they did gatekeeper
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.600]   where if you try to would launch a piece of code that is not not signed not from the app store
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:33.400]   hasn't heard of it it will block it but then if you go right into gatekeeper it will like say it
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:39.080]   will say would you like to with we block your attempt to run this app if you would like we will
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.040]   allow you to run this app now you don't have to go into any it's it's already surfaced for you
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.760]   click one button it's basically you're sure you want to do this because okay don't don't complain
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.800]   complaining to me because you never know when you need an app that's like three or four years old
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   like again you get the old you get your old olympus camera out of the closet that you haven't used
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.600]   for four years but now you've got to use for it and you need to apply a system update but
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.160]   but the system updater has not been up for that camera has not been updated in three years
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.360]   they certainly haven't bothered to get it to get it notarized and so as a result you can't update
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.400]   your camera for this stupid but I think is a kind of a excuse me what I think is an unfounded
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.400]   and heavy-handed reason I hope I agree so this is good I'm glad you were watching the state of
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   the union because obviously there's stuff that they put there that they wanted a little lower
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:35.320]   below the headlines there that is surprising I hope they they backtrack on that yeah they they
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.400]   sort of pass it off as like we're starting this now so that all of you can go ahead and get your
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.760]   app notarized but eventually it's going to be required uh well and as long we're talking about
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:52.040]   that they made a big deal about how panics transmit and rich seagulls bare bones will be back in the
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.280]   app store what do you know about that and he had you asked rich about that because he pulled out
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.920]   of the app store because he couldn't do all the things he wanted to do in the app store yeah it was
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.880]   um I don't think I'm saying I'm revealing anything from any private conversation because he did have
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.200]   a really wonderful blog post just to explain his thinking when he pulled out of the app store
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.720]   that there were just so many onerous burdens to uh they felt as though uh they excuse me everyone
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:23.960]   at bare bones felt as though they had to add do so much work on the soft on the app that didn't add
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.080]   any features it was just for compatibility with the app store that was distracting them from actual
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.360]   features and actual improvements they wanted to make and also the the traditional developer
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.000]   uh complaints about how you're cutting me off from my users I can't really interact with my users
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.360]   directly because I have to you're again you're protecting the user from being able to from me
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.640]   being able to deal with them directly uh but you're not you're just protecting me from good customer
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:57.000]   service so um I don't know exactly what uh change between now and then uh I can speak broadly and
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   say that every time I've spoken to a developer who has had a really intense problem with apple
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.600]   usually that that isn't like some bureaucratic thing where they just got a rubber stamped thing
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.480]   and that then then no response afterward there's always lots and lots of conversation that go on
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:19.400]   before during and after it it gets things get escalated up and down the chain so uh the fact that
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:26.600]   he was uh the fact that uh that it was promoted on a slide meant that there were a lot of discussions
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:32.920]   about that it also shows the amount of value that uh apple places and saying look all the developers
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.800]   that think that we don't under we don't like you and we work against your interests look rich
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.640]   ziegel and bare bones they're back in the app store look Microsoft is putting its apps back in
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.760]   the after hey look adobe adobe creative cloud is coming back into the app store so yeah so so
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.200]   don't and they're really but the world where's transmit uh which also as I remember I think
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:59.400]   panic did also pull out of the app store for the same reason so I'm really curious uh what's going
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.280]   on I'm sure he'll I'm sure he'll have a rich will have a great blog post or a great explanation
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.760]   either he is not he is not uh in the area he is uh on another coast right now uh so when I
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:16.120]   come to my scene again we'll have a long way to do this coding and coming improvements to sand
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:24.040]   boxing finally let us offer all transmit five features in the app store app it will be a subscription
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   uh or you can buy transmit five direct from us which will be a one-time purchase so interesting
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.680]   so that is that is interesting and so there is a change to the app store the sand boxing
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:41.480]   does it sounds like you know before you had to get essentially had to get permission
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:47.080]   to do certain things and the app store apps wouldn't allow you to do some things that some apps need
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.520]   to do and that's why these apps couldn't be in the app store so obviously there is a change
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.960]   to the app store did they mention that at all in the state of the union maybe it's a developer
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.560]   trek yeah no they they talked they talked mostly about uh the the improvements to gatekeeper and
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:11.400]   what I think is going on here is they because they have worked on the security of Mac OS um and
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:18.040]   these improvements to gatekeeper then it makes it easier to offer these sort of deeper features
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:24.280]   to apps um without you know having to be third party essentially like these these or well I mean
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.680]   that's interesting outside of the Mac app store that's interesting okay that would that would
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:36.600]   kind of make sense um okay we'll find out more don't know preview updated screenshots you can now
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.680]   you'll get a little bar that'll let you modify the screenshots we're just looking at more finder
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.640]   improvements plus as you said Andy you could put screenshots where you want
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:53.640]   um I thought this was an interesting use of continuity yeah continuity camera yeah I love that
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.440]   that's uh that's the feature that's a feature where now like if you're in a Mac app and let's say
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.640]   that you're and you're in a stage where you need to take a video or take a thick picture you're not
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:08.920]   limited to FaceTime if your phone is nearby and the Mac and Mac and the phone can see each other
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   essentially the iPhone camera becomes an accessory to the Mac where like let's say you let's say that
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.240]   you're in you're an iMovie you decide oh that's right I didn't get I didn't get an establishing shot
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.880]   of my office before I started talking you can just theoretically just add a clip
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.920]   pick up the iPhone not even and not even have to like launch the camera save something to iCloud
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.640]   is literally you're you're shooting a video and it literally goes straight into iMovie at the place
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.560]   where you said you wanted this clip to go and that is that is exactly the sort of next level
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.960]   stuff that I've been wanting to see uh on the Mac even though it's uh it's an integration feature
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.320]   for the iPhone I always thought that Apple has missed out on a huge trick by not exploiting the
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:56.760]   fact that so many Mac users also have iOS devices I hope this this nods towards a coming feature where
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.320]   I never thought that the touch bar was a good idea it's still not a good idea I like I like that
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.240]   now you can put an automator action inside the touch bar if you have an actual book okay but
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:10.520]   but it's still like it's such a silly way to implement that feature but imagine if if I have my iPad
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.640]   I can just simply have it on an easel like next to the keyboard and Photoshop or the finder
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.080]   anything else can project buttons and user interface onto that thing so I can have like a
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:25.880]   I can have like a scroll wheel a virtual scroll wheel oh my god like something else over there
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.840]   and let me let me just say that be clear that it's not as though Apple has even hinted at these
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:36.520]   features but the fact that now you can realize that maybe maybe this user has a camera nearby
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.960]   that's much better than our crummy little quick little little face-time camera in a case that
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.880]   maybe they're going to start to think about ways of that as well I'll say that that's something that
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.920]   would really get me interested in staying with the Mac if suddenly they had that's kind of a
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:56.760]   compatibility yeah yeah yeah you got me drooling over here my god that sounds awesome well I know
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.240]   it's not a real thing but that would be very cool I'm you know continuity and handoff have lots
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.520]   more capabilities I'll be interested to see what else they can do with this but I love the idea of
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:12.360]   using your phone as a data capture device that could then immediately go right it connects your
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.440]   phone and your that's what handoffs all about it connects your phone and your desktop but
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.800]   this is a nice way to to implement that I'm encouraged by that but and there's a few more weird
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:30.040]   things it is odd they're putting iOS apps like news okay I get stocks on the Mac why did they
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:36.120]   give so much attention to stocks is very strange yeah it's it's like here's this here's a
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.480]   stocks has been an app that has been no one wants okay one of the big features of iOS 10 was that
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.560]   you could hide stocks I was I was I was yeah I was about to say most of the press about the stocks
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.880]   app in the past several years is our tips and tricks on how to hide it in a folder or how to
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:57.240]   like get it off of the off of the launcher and okay it's integrated with news okay that's nice and
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.920]   yes it can get lit okay again integrating with news doesn't bother me as much as saying oh and now
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.280]   our stock apps does so much more we're gonna put it on the Mac there probably there's probably a
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.760]   huge there's like a huge group of people out there that have just loved this and they were all
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.960]   probably together celebrating no if you're so interested in the stock market you have much much
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:24.120]   better tools that's fair that give you information you need that the stock apps doesn't do including
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:30.280]   news which every you know if you go to Yahoo finance Google finance any any finance app they all have
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:37.720]   news that's like de facto so this is just bizarre it's as bizarre as the measure app
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:44.680]   wise and even one minute on stage on that precious keynote time say we have an app that
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.240]   will measure things I want to I want to talk about that but the but getting back to stocks for a
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:55.080]   second sometimes you forget the fact that every person who works at Apple their daily carry phone
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.840]   they want to know how the apple stocks do it yeah okay that that too but it's like sometimes
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:06.920]   we try to ascribe what was the huge like five-year plan of that requires them to update the stocks
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.280]   app sometimes it literally is that the people who the people who build the operating system for
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:18.120]   ios and build the apps are sick and tired of they they use a stock tracking act and their app and
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.160]   they're sick and tired of their own in-house app is terrible so they might they might have just
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.880]   simply said we want to build this for ourselves and find will release to everybody else but it
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:33.320]   it shames us that this is so terrible that sometimes oftentimes a feature that hits the macro ios is
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.640]   that simple it's something that they wanted for themselves yeah okay i have to we have to talk
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.280]   about because this was the thing that i wanted more than anything else i've every time it's come
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.400]   up on a podcast somebody's asking what do you want what do you want to see from WWDC and i got it and
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:53.960]   it was both that Siri on the Mac can control home kit stuff now and in the fact that they brought
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:00.280]   the home app to Mac i am thrilled the apple gods were listening to me and my prayers apparently
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:07.960]   it's finally here the home app is limited as Andy talked about uh in the case that yes it's an ios
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.480]   app that exists on the Mac but they haven't leveraged much of you know the Mac's capabilities with it
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:19.240]   but i don't care it's still there i can control my my home kit accessories from the Mac i can use
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:25.720]   Siri to do that i'm i'm thrilled and pleased and i you know made this the necessary sacrifices that
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.360]   i had to make to the apple gods to make that happen so glad it all worked out so there was
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.840]   some question Negan and i were talking about this uh it kind of makes sense to have home kit on a
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:41.080]   mobile device but you and i likened it to the sonos app where the best way to control a sonos is
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.880]   with the app as opposed to your voice and and it's on the phone and it's on your iPad but every
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.200]   once in a while i do want it on my desktop because i'm listening to music in my office so that's
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.520]   where you come down on this mica that is nice to have what are the advantages of having home
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.200]   kit on a desktop so one of the things that's super important to me is that i'm a bit of a control
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:08.120]   freak and Siri does uh an okay job of communicating and controlling my home kit stuff but the way
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:13.000]   that it works right now is it's very limited you have to say like turn this particular light
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.760]   this color and then you go back in you say okay i want to shut off the lights here
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:22.360]   da da da da da da da i want to be able to make exact adjustments in the exact way that i want
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:28.840]   to make them across multiple different devices uh home kit accessories rather and so what this
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:35.640]   allows me to do is from from the the home kit app on the Mac i'm always adding new home kit
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.440]   and able accessories and shuffling them around to different rooms and it's sort of pesky to have
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:46.360]   to use a finger and hold down and and type you know type on the screen to rename things and
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.320]   adjust them to different rooms by bringing this to the Mac i can use my keyboard and my trackpad
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:57.800]   or mouse to make these adjustments a lot quicker and a lot easier and then the fact is because i'm
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:05.160]   a writer who works from my home office from my computer a lot of the times i will be at my desk
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.600]   and just want to make those adjustments from there so i think that this is more of a control
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:19.720]   freak kind of feature but also for anybody who wants to you know easily adjust and move around
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:24.520]   things and organize their their home kit enabled accessories by doing it on the Mac i think it
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.080]   gets a little bit easier yeah that's what that's what i figured but i just didn't know anybody who
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:35.640]   did it and not and and not only that they're even simple things like number one series should be
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.680]   Siri everywhere or else it's not Siri you've got you can't have Siri jr on the mackerels you're
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:47.160]   just not gonna try to have Siri jr on the home pod uh but that's different home pod is if you
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.840]   bought it if you've already bought it you weren't you're you really like the idea of having a handle
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.800]   low and i can't elope it has a speaker and an apple logo so next year we could talk about that
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:02.200]   okay but but the it's makes it but also makes sense that if i'm at my mac i am real i am dead center
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:07.000]   in front of a microphone as opposed to maybe if i'm working if i'm working on on my mac
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.560]   maybe my phone is in the other room maybe it's in the bedroom charging or maybe it's in my pocket
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:17.320]   and it's just there's just no reason for it not to support everything that i can do on the on
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:26.520]   i was fair enough uh so news and i make sense to put news on there although to me you know if
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:32.200]   you're at a desktop you're you can use your browser perfectly well to get news yeah all right this
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:38.440]   is see this is where it goes the other direction where they're apifying stuff which makes sense on
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:44.920]   iOS but on the desktop it worries me a little bit the way they pitched it in the state of the union
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:54.440]   was that these were some of the apps that they saw as being the simplest to try out this new thing
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.560]   basically so macOS and it's a marzipan it's a marzipan yeah exactly yeah they're testing it
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:04.440]   out they're seeing how it works and these apps were easy to sort of map mouse events to ui events
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.880]   let's take a little break because i do want to talk about marzipan i want to talk about privacy
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:15.480]   uh a lot of what apple said on the stage yesterday was really a subtle hidden a crypto dig at facebook
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:22.280]   and google but we'll talk about that in a lot more and he not goes here from our fabulous friend from
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:28.680]   nakko.com mica sergeant from mobile nations and of course i'm more he's a senior editor at
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:34.360]   mobile nations i showed they brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans quick and
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.760]   loans number one lender in the country both in volume and in customer satisfaction number one
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.800]   eight years in a row number one according to jd power for mortgage origination number one
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.080]   four years in a row for mortgage servicing they are great their customers love them but there was
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.120]   one thing missing rocket mortgage recognized that the whole home loan experience was kind of stuck
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   in the dickens era i mean the idea of getting dressed up and going to a bank please uh can i
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.920]   have some money and then and then uh you know filling out like oh yeah here money here fill
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:14.360]   this 20 page application out and get back to me and then going to the attic and finding pay stubs
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   from four years ago i mean this whole thing was antiquated they said yeah we could do this better
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:25.560]   we've got something called computing power so they decided that uh they could put this all online
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:32.920]   no more going to the bank uh you you just go to rocket mortgage.com/macbreak and when you get there
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.880]   it's a simple you know just a couple of questions you can answer right off the top of your head
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.040]   then because they have relationships with all the financial institutions they get all the
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.320]   information they need as long as you say go ahead they crunch the numbers based on income assets
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.120]   and credit they'll immediately i mean under ten minutes it takes just a few minutes will analyze
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.680]   all the home loan options you qualify for and find the one that's right for you you choose the term
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:02.440]   the down payment the rate you apply simply you will understand exactly what's going on understand
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:08.680]   fully and then mortgage confidently so fast you could be at an open house and say let's buy this
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:14.200]   house honey go through the process a few minutes later show the realtor we're approved we'd like
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:21.000]   to make an offer that is power to get started go to rocket mortgage.com/macbreak
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.240]   they're an equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and mls consumer access.org number 30 30
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:34.360]   rocketmortgage.com/macbreak you're only minutes away from a home loan or a refi
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.840]   and by the way people sometimes say well do they have good rates yes everybody I've talked to
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.280]   who's used rocket mortgage and I know quite a few people now say they had the best rates they were
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:49.480]   out there rocketmortgage.com/macbreak you owe it to yourself give it a try.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:56.680]   We thank them so much for making Macbreak weekly possible so they've really beefed up safari not
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:03.640]   only in iOS but it looks like you're going to have this in Mac OS as well including
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.680]   something that no other browser does right now and they and they'd ask Mark Zuckerberg about
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:14.280]   this when he testified before congress what about shadow profiles mr. Zuckerberg and Mark
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:21.400]   said what I don't know what that is oh really okay either mark's not paying attention or
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.960]   he's lying shadow profiles of course the fact that you don't even have to have a Facebook
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.440]   account for Facebook to track you on the web those like buttons everywhere identify you
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   uniquely and let Facebook know what you're visiting on the internet those will be blocked
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   in safari tracking prevention keeps social media like buttons share buttons or comment
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:48.760]   widgets from tracking you without permission that that that's something Google's never going to do
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:56.520]   right that's well I I agree they'll they'll be happy to shut down Facebook like buttons yeah
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:02.680]   but yeah they're already getting enough antitrust action from right from the EU as it is but yeah
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.880]   this is this is an area in which a classic example of what we're talking about earlier that
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:12.040]   no it's not like a flashy feature oh here's something I can do that I've never been able to do
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:18.280]   before on a macro and iOS device this is a whole suite of these little little features like again
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:23.080]   shutting down all shutting down all these trackers automatically now basically if it's if one of
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:27.640]   those like buttons is there it doesn't make them disappear but there'll be a little warning that
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.640]   says like a caution saying hey this is this is a face this is a like button that can track you do
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:37.800]   want the tracking to happen or not but also they're doing things like often there's so many sneaky
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.680]   tricks that marketers and advertisers use like profiling your system and if they can't get your
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:48.600]   ID from one way they'll figure out that well here are the plugins that this this browser is running
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:55.160]   here is the configuration of this of this of the machine that's running it so now apple safari
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.520]   will also when the when the website asks for details about the machine and the web browser is
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:05.640]   running it will give them a really stripped down and almost anonymous like the least amount of
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:11.800]   information possible they've also taken out of in previous editions of Mac OS you could sort of
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.200]   like inside preferences set that here is my twitter account here's my twitter handle here's
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.560]   my facebook account here's my here's my facebook i facebook password so that that sort of stuff will
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:27.240]   auto auto login and and like sharing features some of them that are powered by apple excuse me apple
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.520]   software will work now apparently the beta neither of those is as they're maybe will be restored
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.440]   later on but apparently there's there's a really big and really emphatic lockdown on getting things
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.160]   not only encrypted and secured but also protecting the user on the web which is a really really nice
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   feature yeah yeah one that one that one it like you said that won't be thought too much about but
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.480]   in the end it makes a huge difference and i'm glad that there are people uh there that are focusing
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:57:00.440]   on this and i love that that very clever okay we will give you the the very small amount of user
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:05.320]   identifier data that we have to give you but it's going to look exactly like hundreds of thousands
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:11.640]   of other people's data uh that are user profiles as well and i think that's a pretty clever and a nice
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.040]   nice smug moment for me to go ha ha you have no idea who i am
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:25.080]   uh yeah i mean i think that apple is smart to double down on privacy i'm not fully convinced
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:32.280]   that they keep everything as private as they'd like you to think um you know that their
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:36.840]   tim cook gave an interview on npr saying no we never asked facebook for additional information
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:41.560]   uh although the times new york times said that they did and
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:49.240]   yeah the latest for the if you're talking about the the latest mini scandal with facebook that
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:55.880]   uh they're they've been basically handing information to like uh phone and interviews with the times
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.360]   facebook identified other partners partners who got in requested and got information
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:07.400]   including apple samsung and amazon so this is a okay maybe it's a he said zuck said thing
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:14.920]   tim denies it but facebook says no no apple requested it and got it um apple says and then a
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.720]   spokesperson says something completely different from tim the company relied on private access to
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos of the social network without opening
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:29.080]   the app interestingly uh if you look at the new mohavi and this may be something that only the
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.960]   beta has there's no mention of linking to your facebook or twitter account in mohavi as it has
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:40.440]   been in previous versions of macos yeah so there's a little disagreement i don't think
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:47.000]   this is the problem i have with sometimes with apple i think that uh i don't think they're completely
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.560]   forthright in their interest for instance again another new york times story paul mannefort got
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:59:00.600]   in trouble yesterday uh the feds asked the judge to revoke bale because they said mannefort's been
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:07.560]   trying to influence witnesses in his indictment uh how do the feds know this mannefort was using
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:14.680]   what's encrypted messaging programs like what's happened signal and we know from the feds warrant
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.000]   that the way that they got mannefort the information and the and the actual text of these
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.560]   messages from supposedly encrypted messaging apps was they have access to his i-cloud stuff it's
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:32.520]   in the warrant so uh well apple would would like to pretend everything is hidden and encrypted
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.440]   they're storing it
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:41.160]   uh how do they have access how do they have access to his i-cloud stuff though and the first one see
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:46.920]   this is a perfect example mica you ought to know better apple has never said they don't have full
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:54.840]   access to your i-cloud no i'm curious like well i'm curious how the the lawmaker or these the this
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.920]   one i have a warrant access to have a warrant okay that's what i was i'm sorry i missed that part
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   they well and that's an important distinction it's not like somebody can't just read it
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.120]   you know i mean you have to have a warrant but apple will with a duly you know with the law
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:14.200]   enforcement subpoena warrant will hand it over and so they have it is the point
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:22.680]   and uh i think people often feel like oh well you know uh apple that nobody it's my data is safe
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   because nobody has it well i cloud has it yeah the the point being that you're always responsible
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.480]   for the security of your own data and that you're in even even if apple is the most trustworthy
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.400]   company when it comes to privacy and security and i believe that they are in terms of mass market
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.720]   consumer products that doesn't mean that you can say oh i'm using apple product good i'm safe
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.800]   it really it will also depend on that app behaving properly it will also depend on as there there
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.600]   might be some data that is being held is being handed over to verizon is being handed over to
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.520]   that that atnt is collecting that your internet service providers collecting so that's why if you
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.840]   if you are doing something that would event that might eventually lead for lead to an indictment
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.800]   happening perhaps this is when you want to meet someone face to face at a neutral location
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.440]   uh on a road by the side of the desert or again learn how torbrows the torbrows are works and
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.880]   actual and encryption works and i prefer self-destructing parchment uh and invisible link
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.560]   myself paul mannefort probably didn't read this disclaimer that said in the apple backup that
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.160]   says back up your chat history media i cloud so if you lose your iphone or switch to new one your
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.320]   chat history is safe you can restore your chat history and media when you reinstall what's app
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   media and messages you back up are not protected by what's app and encryption while in i cloud he
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:47.880]   must have just missed that he probably didn't see that very small detail missed that but it's there
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:56.520]   so you're right and either but i guess i just i think that a lot of people just think oh it's safe
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.600]   it's encrypted and uh do you think they even think that much no i feel like they don't even go that
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:08.840]   far with it honestly like it wait encrypted that's cool i didn't even know it did that use telegram
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:17.160]   as well same thing so uh just so you know and uh you know i'm not i doubt that tim cook's going
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.720]   down to the basement and looking at your i cloud data but i'll hit see all my dogs let's be a but
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.880]   if there's been if there's a breach and there have been breaches of i cloud remember that's how
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.840]   we know what scarlet joe hans is but looks like uh no actually that's not how we know but it's
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.880]   lost in translation translation the first like we know from we know from other sources but but
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:41.400]   honestly that's when the the uh those are all stored in my cloud all those celebrity uh
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:50.520]   and newties uh and so it's possible either through a hacker gaining access uh a um malign employee
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.480]   you just you just need to need to understand that so uh no i don't know why i'm bringing that up i'm
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.160]   just saying that apple may pay a lot of attention to this but it still has all that stuff in the cloud
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:11.240]   um ios 12 let's move on um the big thing i'm thrilled first of all it's going to be any uh
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.760]   ios device that supports ios 11 will sport 12 they're not cutting off the bottom end that's i what
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.640]   did you say any five s and up five s and up pretty much and big speed improvements now they didn't say
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.920]   as you point out that whether these will migrate to lower end phones or not but i would imagine a
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:33.160]   70 percent faster swipe to camera 50 percent faster keyboard display twice as fast uh app launch
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   under heavy workload that's those are big improvements yeah at a time when uh if you bought uh if you
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.760]   bought a uh a pixel excuse me if you bought a nexus phone from google went at the same time you
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:51.640]   bought like a five s or even an iphone six yeah you can still run the latest version of the os on the
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.720]   hunt the iphone six you cannot run the latest version oh excuse me when it's released later this
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.480]   year you will not be able to run the latest version of android on that contemporary device so that's
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.040]   really really great stuff it's also good it's also i think partly an acknowledgement of the fact that
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:12.840]   apple's apple solution for being able to sell iPhones in a market where people don't have a thousand
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:19.000]   dollars to spend on a phone is maintaining a very very lively second and third hand uh iphone
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.520]   market and basically making sure that if someone if someone were to blister pack an iphone five s
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.800]   able still be able to they'll still be able to sell that person music and sell that person apps
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.080]   so that's it's very very smart on all the way you go around with this yeah yeah by the way i read
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:41.800]   the i read the asterisks on this or the asterisks on this and uh these measurements were on a six s
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:48.120]   so it is you know it does improve it considerably even on a very slow phone it actually may not be
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.680]   as much improvement on a faster phone i'm sorry go ahead i'm like oh i was i was curious if that
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:00.600]   also means you know we get more money from third party uh device resellers like gazelle and things
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:07.480]   like that because these older devices now are you know better better working with the latest
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.960]   software i'm just wondering if that has any effect on that i would imagine so means they can
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:19.640]   sell them for more right yeah there's a top risk or market for older iPhones that still we i sometimes
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:24.680]   poke fun and apple for again ignoring basically selling like high-end phones but the fact matter
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:30.920]   is getting back to if you if you bought a nexus 6p or nexus 5x not only does it not get the latest
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:36.360]   software but these were also phones that had like boot like boot loop problems that were related to
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:42.600]   like unseating of chips on on the device uh they're not as they weren't as sturdily made as an iphone
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:48.840]   five s again an iphone five s was i think might have been my last daily carry i was device or not far
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.960]   from it uh and i still have it and if i were to fire it up it's will still like light up just fine
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:59.240]   i'm sure it'll be perfectly good and it's still like classic lovely design so you but you you pay
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.120]   extra money for apple devices but the fact matter is that those darn things last a long time and
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:10.360]   apples apples supports them for a darn long time are we excited about face timing fit 32 people at
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:17.160]   once oh god no i don't have i don't have 32 friends so i don't need it there you go i think i have
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.880]   FaceTime turned off on most of my devices because my mom tries to used to try to FaceTime me all
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:27.160]   the time i'm like mom i don't want to hold this phone up to my face like this for three hours while
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:34.040]   i'm talking to you uh so i just have it turned off uh it mica it's the only way i talk to my mother
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.560]   she refuses to use anything else yeah but i just i don't understand what on the ipad or the computer
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.280]   and then i could be doing other things and talking to it that that that's that's very nice i should
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:51.240]   probably be more graceful or grateful or kind but i just i don't somebody made the joke and i thought
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.080]   this was kind of funny the way that you can and we're i know we're gonna talk about it soon but the
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:01.160]   way that you can use me moji in FaceTime uh so what was like that means i don't have to clean up my
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.960]   entire apartment and comb my hair and do this and actually i have a face like i'm saying no
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:12.360]   because the way they demonstrated it the mo moji is on your head but it's your body oh that's true
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.960]   you're still clean your room until all you don't you don't have to brush your hair do your makeup
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.680]   that's all there you go so you're all excited let's talk about me moji so this is animojis
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:28.040]   this is iphone 10 only they didn't say that and i i realized during ios today the reason they didn't
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.120]   say that is because this is coming out with the next generation of iphone so what it really is
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.720]   ios 12 the new iphones and the iphone 10 you'd needs that special camera array in the notch
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.160]   uh but it's gonna do the same thing animojis do with it you know the ghost and the tiger and
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:50.360]   the koala those are all the new ones in a dinosaur or the old poop emoji except that instead of poop
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:56.040]   it'll be your face which depending on whether you cleaned up for that thing no i'm just gonna
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.640]   i am really excited about the course you are like i'm so glad i found somebody who is
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.560]   i'm a big user well if rene was here he would say the same um he and i are both big users of bit
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.880]   moji which are the little characters that you can create snapchat bought the company and you
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:16.040]   create these little characters that look like you or don't look like you depending on what you
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.200]   want and you can send them around but they're more static snapchat added a few that move around but
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.840]   not according to your face yes but i should point out that sam san does this with the s9
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.720]   true thing that's the mistake sam san made is they take a picture of you and then automatically do it
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:38.600]   and it's uncanny valley as hell it's really you look you look like one of those like like four
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:45.320]   year old pageant kids like yeah you've ever seen like their their photos like they're their people
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.360]   their company their individuals will like photoshop like pageant photos and it's just like let's erase
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.480]   everything and make the eyes yeah that's that it's creepy it's creepy and i think i was wise to
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.200]   avoid uncanny valley by making these a they're not based on pictures like the bit moji and then
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.360]   the s9 you have to build them and and they're more much more cartoony right yeah they're
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.920]   styled after the anemoji themselves and i think one thing that i want to note with this
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:15.240]   that bit moji has failed on that i think the sam san thing is has failed on in a way that google
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:24.360]   with the version of their anemoji too they don't have a whole lot of customization options and so
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.880]   by the time you get to like your finished design it doesn't really look like you and i think that
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.720]   or i've at least seen people talking about how much you can customize with these and i'm really
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:42.600]   happy about that and particularly with people of color um anemoji or i'm sorry bit moji and others
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.920]   have really failed to capture some of the uh hairstyles and textures of people of color in the
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:54.840]   past and apple clearly took the time to i think get some of this right so all of this is to say
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:01.320]   like yes it's a super super silly thing i just think it's fun and i'm glad that apple was before
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.920]   they released this feature it seems that they paid some level of attention to inclusivity on getting
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:12.920]   you know the as many people's possible looks as possible here's uh marquez brownly speaking of
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:19.160]   people color with his uh me moji and yeah it looks great and it while it doesn't look exactly like
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.520]   him here is yeah his hairstyle is not unpopular he that should they should be sure they'll
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.720]   go that would be standard in there yeah yeah i mean also it's not creepy
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:36.520]   which yeah but the and the other thing and the other thing is that like with the it's nice to i think
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.640]   the way to do this feature is exactly the way that apple decided to do it people want to control the
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.600]   way that this thing looks they don't want it yes it's a really cool tech demo of look just
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.520]   look into the 3d camera it will build an automatic like 3d emoji of of you like no i want to be able
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:58.120]   to shoot no if you got my skin tone wrong i want to fix that if you got my if you got my the shape
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.360]   of my face exactly right but i'm very very self-conscious about like the size of my nose or the size of my ears
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.680]   i want to be able i don't care if it is like a lie i want my ears to be a little bit a little bit
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.880]   smaller or i want to change my hairline forward or back and it's i'm not i'm certainly not going to
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.640]   make fun of this feature it's it's a fun feature and it's because a phone is such a personal device
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:27.160]   it should be fun okay this is a this is the uh this is the uh sam sung uh that i took a picture of me
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:33.240]   and it somehow it got my like five o'clock shadow the teeth aren't quite right it looked i looked like
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:39.160]   Bill Clinton i i was gonna say i thought that was still Clinton i did not have sex with that woman i didn't
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:47.480]   oh well for me all us gray hairs look the same uh so this is a little uncanny valley i mean it's
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:54.760]   it's similarly it all fun but it's a weird shading but it's but yeah and it's and it's super fun to
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:00.840]   the the the emoji can actually let's be tracking your features and tracking your face and you can
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   actually do something that's kind of live i thought i thought that was that was probably the most fun
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:10.600]   demo of the entire thing as she was uh building it but also i was really impressed with the fact
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.720]   that it wasn't like here's a static emoji and now here is you like it's like as she's talking about
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:22.280]   what she's doing yeah the emoji and process goes from this like shaved barbie head that's like been
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.080]   like bleached of all that hasn't been painted yet to something that as as she's talking now it's
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.800]   talking as you're doing it really is like a scene out of west world only without the nudity or
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:38.200]   violence it was very very very that's an interesting way to put it yeah actually i was very impressed
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.240]   by a number of the presenters let me turn off the sound here but i was going to see if i could find her
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.080]   for her um
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:52.600]   also i don't think we've seen another apple keynote that had so much representation of both genders
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:59.000]   yeah a lot of women on stage and the women demonstrated real skills in bicycling
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.800]   creating an emojis while their work came in this these poor this poor woman was breathless as she's
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.840]   as she's chatting with jay blonick she was she was just kind of out of breath as she was uh
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:17.080]   bicycling that was i was i was very impressed by the women on stage did a good job exactly being
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:22.920]   able to like not only talk but also talk to a very very tightly controlled script while exerting
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:29.640]   yourself i am not the person to call for that here's the here's uh oh god good for her no i'll never
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.520]   be able to use windows okay here's uh here's the example of the barbie she uh so she's she's using
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:42.360]   where's my audio are you not hearing it it's not perfect there we go so i could add things like
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.440]   shapes or text so in real time she's gonna make a
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:54.760]   ooh so this is comic book it's really fun but for a little bit cynical about a tiny dog hat i think
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.800]   i just think she changed her hair to pick her look as much like do you think she got a she went to the
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:06.360]   beauty parlor and said can you duplicate this oh my goodness not the whole do that they hold up
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.160]   there they're me moji i want to look i have to i have to move a little farther along i think for
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.840]   the i think it was before this because i think this is where she already has it and she's gonna
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:20.680]   replace her face oh okay all right let me uh yeah you're right here we go so she's got her uh
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:30.040]   did you lose my audio again yes i swear to god i just uh roll i don't know how windows works
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.800]   there we go there it is that you cast it or me i'll be cute and cuddly though okay so here's our t-rex
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:42.600]   you're making me think i can't use a machine and we've our very own friendly little ghost oh now
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.480]   with tongue detection i loved how they made a big deal at that not only well that's actually kind of
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.040]   interesting it shows how it finds things getting it also does wink detecting you know you don't
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.680]   it doesn't just blink you can also wink and evolve in your eyes move as well uh with the gaze detection
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.840]   here's the bald Kelsey so i selected a skin color it's still following her what's cool she's doing
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.440]   this live and it's following her mouth is which is really neat i thought that scales up as well as
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:18.680]   she moves her head from side to side okay onto the main event there are so many hairstyles to choose
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.160]   from first i'm gonna grab my color unless your mark is brown and then like i said i need to go
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.560]   a little bit shorter all right i'm gonna use these in a tender profile because that might actually
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:35.560]   get me some more a lot of people replace their uh twitter avatars with them already i've seen oh
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   really yeah i might have to get beta side and keep up with the kids i i haven't yeah i've not
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.800]   installed it on my iphone tin yet so i haven't actually made it as much as i said i was excited
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:51.640]   about it during the state of the union they said that the reason they well this was sort of a joke
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.320]   but also i could see it but what are the reasons they added tongue detection was because when people
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.920]   were trying out the feature one of the first things they did was stick out the tongue and it
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.640]   was the environment that they didn't have yeah but it does show off how sophisticated this stuff is
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.720]   getting i was i was thinking about how this could help accessibility to give like descriptive text
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.600]   of here is the expert you're talking you can you you're talking to somebody so your vision impaired
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.600]   here's what their face looks like right now they're smiling right now they're making right now
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:24.360]   that's oh yeah that's a great idea yeah right here into the drawer alongside the rest of my team and
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.920]   it's still talking even down there in the drawer that's very cool it's pretty amazing
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:32.760]   that's see that's when that's when you're playing this game at expert level
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.440]   yeah so it's not necessary to have live and have it to shrink down a be
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.840]   elsewhere when the interface for the selections are different but like you know what we're we're
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.520]   playing at expert level we're playing from the we're getting from we're hitting from the back
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.320]   back these have we're gonna do that that's always been impressive with the with the demos they
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:56.680]   earned that thousand bucks i'll tell you uh they also they also expanded it from if you're doing
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:02.600]   enemojis from 10 seconds to 30 seconds so now you you can record more than one line when you're
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.640]   doing your lip sync video hi here i am i just wanted to say how are you doing it's like no i need
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:16.520]   more time i'm joy lucky you're lucky the video that your colleague rene richy posted on instagram of
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:24.760]   him playing augmented reality yes what was it slingshot right with the i justine i can't remember
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.600]   what it's what you know what apple calls it but yeah it's essentially these blocks are all set up
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:33.880]   and you slingshot around and it's so funny it's this is a little bit dystopian in a way watching
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:40.600]   these two people play on a blank table but but showing off that ar kid is now a multiplayer
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.000]   not so you can have people you can have not only multiple people playing this game but
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.400]   multiple people watching you watching the players play the game they also added something that i'm
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.560]   kind of concerned and excited to see how developers deal with handle to implement this but you can
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:05.880]   actually basically place a a 3d object somewhere like geographically so basically you can you can
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.480]   like do a geocache where you're hiding you know an oscar statuette at the base of a statue and it
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.600]   will just always be there so anybody who just comes along they will find it there whether
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.560]   there's like one person with this app or 500 people with this app so i love that kind of cool
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:27.560]   another example that they gave was a pin board in like your home so that you and your you and
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.880]   your family can post photos to it and so he would be able to come back to that spot every time and
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:39.640]   hold up your iphone or your ipad and add photos to it or add different documents and things and so
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:45.720]   i'm i'm willing to draw the line right there inside your own damn home you can actually
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.400]   write something on a piece of paper get a magnet that shaped like Yosemite and put it on the damn
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.440]   fridge that's what the fridge that's why the fridge is still made out of metal let me see if i can
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:04.040]   find because they did a pretty good demo of the uh of the game um i wasn't that impressed with the
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:10.600]   lego stuff that seemed to me like uh it was taking away some of the capabilities that you know a
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:17.240]   kid would expect with lego uh it was a it was a nice demo it would be interesting like to build
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.040]   the lego version of Cinderella's of like the millennium falcon and but when you and when you
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.960]   hold them when you're finished with this tactile real world thing you now see that there are
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:31.480]   tie fighters fly Lego tie fighters flying around and it didn't look like that was actually what you
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:37.640]   could do i think you have to buy the playhouse right exactly no that's the anchor it's the idea
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.000]   that it's the idea that once you've built this model once you've actually built this
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.560]   no i'm saying you don't get to build it you have to buy it oh you think it came pre-built the name
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.360]   thing oh for sure no i'm so i i i don't i don't question that like if you have an astound i'm sure
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.240]   it's not i'd be i'd be very very impressed if it is if you just build a random shape house i don't
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:03.080]   never do but but but but that that would be cool again of course i've focused on star wars but
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.160]   it would be cool but you might have a millennium falcon what's your kid
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.720]   because well again an enhancement to it where now there's not only is it like this hey look this
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.920]   cool like little animated diorama but no now there are you can see like imperial walkers
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.640]   that let's let's say now your your little playtime scenario is that the reason why your
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.120]   millennium falcon is like park here is because once again the warp warp drive and the impulse drive
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:28.920]   are both shot you can see on the top of it like chewy and han solo are both trying to fix it
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:34.200]   your job is to like you've got the perspective point of view of someone in an arabol a wing
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.440]   trying to shoot at the imperial walkers that are slowly steadily coming towards it across
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:44.840]   your living room carpet yes i would i would buy an iphone 10 the uh the millennium falcon lego kit
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.640]   and a living room carpet big enough right without any fun understand i don't think you'd be able
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:56.200]   to modify the lego kit you no no i have to be glued together because you can't build it because you
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.280]   have to have it look like that so that they can do it i don't think it's smart enough to do it on
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.040]   the fly is what i'm saying well that's well that's see unfortunately that's one of the things that
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:10.120]   defines the difference between anybody below the age of 35 and above the age of 35 i remember the days
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.840]   where you just got like the big paint bucket full of legos and you built yourself a damn millennium
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.560]   falcon it didn't have a book of instructions i say oh wait stop stop you're building the
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.000]   millennium falcon wrong all right well it's my millennium falcon dammit and if it's mostly white
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.440]   bricks with yellow and red bricks in the middle and it's not great the shape welds
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:35.000]   and that's what i mean when i'm i'm feeling like i mean it's a cool demo they showed a castle it's
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.280]   very much like microsoft did with with their minecraft demo uh there i was thank you for finding to
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:47.080]   play a minecraft yeah that'd be so fun so but but but my sense was you buy this prefabbed town you
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:52.680]   can't modify it because it would screw it up and and then you can stick figures in it and to me that's
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:58.840]   not as kid friendly yeah it's a nice demo but it's not as kid friendly so as long as as long as we
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.320]   agree that's not that you build this thing that comes in a big box and it's already built for you
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:09.160]   it's it's not i think it's an add-on like play feature because once once you've built the you
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:14.360]   you've you've got the you got the the cinderella's castle or you got the millennium falcon or you've
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.880]   got the whatever kit and you've spent like two days like building it up and then and now it's just
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:26.200]   the static object that's just goes on a shelf or that your big sister is mad at you so she smashes
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.240]   it then hides half the pieces you can't put a fact together again uh the fact that now this can be
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:37.560]   like the center of an identifiable piece of a virtual playset i think that's a cool i can't
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.120]   wait to see what developers are sure i think i think this is super super interesting let's take a
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:47.400]   little break we're going to talk about watch o s and tv o s we got a lot this is was a two-hour
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:53.080]   45-minute keynote we got a lot to was it that long two and a half hours to 220 quarter i think
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:59.320]   yeah two and a quarter long keynote we'll talk about uh watching tv o s just a second i showed
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:08.200]   it i brought to you by 23 and me for father's day it's i i started i did 23 me when they first
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.840]   started which was some years ago and one of the things i love about it you just it's a dna kit you
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.120]   spit into a little vial send it back to them and they come back i should open my uh my account here
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:24.120]   and they come back with about 75 reports all about you and let's let's stipulate the most
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.880]   fascinating book in the world is the book all about you so it's all about your genetics what
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:36.760]   both in ancestry and health what it what it tells you about you and where your people came from and
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:42.200]   uh you know what uh what wellness traits you have what you know weird traits too like uh do you
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:49.320]   are you prone to back hair strange stuff like that too um oh i have an invite to share in dna
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:55.400]   relatives let me show this so my mom so i love it and it was really fun because i got uh i have to
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.120]   say i got uh a lot of information out of it and then over the years as they learn more about
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:05.800]   genetic markers uh they added more reports so there's always more coming to you all the time
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:12.520]   and then i gave it to my sister my mom for christmas and you see my mom wants to share her dna
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:19.800]   information with me so now we can share and combine it and i and dad hasn't done it yet so here's the
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:27.960]   good news they've got a great deal 30% off uh now through june 17 30% off every kid it includes free
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:35.800]   gift wrap if you haven't done it get it for yourself get it for dad and get 30% off both go to 23andme.com/twit
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:43.000]   23andme.com/twit so i'm gonna accept by the way look at this we predict maria laport is your
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:52.440]   mother look at that good news you share 49.9% of my dna was shared with my mom so as you fill in
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:58.840]   this tree you can see more and more and more it's really really cool and we're gonna have to put
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:04.360]   our ancestor locations in here so we haven't done that yet i'll show you the ancestry report which is
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:12.760]   really really neat i could see that i'm 39.1% british and irish but i've got a little neanderthal in there
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.960]   265 neanderthal uh variants that means 4% of my dna is neanderthal that's a good example of stuff
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   that they've learned they only they for when i first did it they didn't even know that
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:31.000]   it's helmosapiens could interbreed with neanderthals that was considered by scientists probably unlikely
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.760]   then they found some genetic material from neanderthal genetic material a few years ago
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.920]   and they found out yeah oh no you know what they did in her breed and now i can find out how much
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:45.720]   of me there are many people who have more neanderthal in my family my sister has less she's been
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:52.840]   lording it over me ever since 23andme.com/twit i found out another thing the other day you can
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:26:02.520]   download your entire dna stuff your whole thing and upload it there are sites that you can upload
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.080]   it to the raw data that's the word i was looking for that you can upload it to and will give you
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.000]   additional analysis this is so cool i can see what my markers are
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.160]   a great by the way wouldn't it be great to get for a kid who's studying genetics to give them
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:27.560]   some real world stuff to work on and understand 23andme.com/twit right now through father's day
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:34.200]   30% off every kit through june 17th uh which means you could take advantage of this too
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.960]   it's actually better when you do it with your family i have everybody except that
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.040]   so i hope he's not watching you know knows what his gift will be 23andme.com/twit
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.720]   if before before we go on to watch us on apple tv do you want to just talk about a little bit
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.960]   series shortcuts yeah oh i'm sorry i left that out because i think that's maybe one of the most
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:27:00.600]   of so this was my supposition apple bought workflow which was a great third party app on ios
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:06.280]   it's about a year ago uh workflow was like automated for ios but it's very limited because it's ios
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.160]   and and third party apps don't get access to things like the wifi signal or whatever apple
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.920]   bought it and i was been waiting for them to kind of incorporate it i my guess is these series
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:22.760]   workflows are really workflow right it looks just like it i mean the yeah the the app looks just like
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:29.720]   it and many of the features are similar and in fact right now you can create because in the in
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.640]   the beta there is no uh short concept is yet but you can create workflows in workflow and then use
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.920]   them uh the short concept exists perfect so it's going to be even better because apple of course
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.720]   has access to all the sensors all the information all the stuff the third parties don't get access
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:52.440]   to so i can imagine so one of the things she showed is and the way this is the things people ding google
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:59.560]   for for being creepy my my iphone knows that i have a mim mojito every morning of my way to work
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:06.120]   so suddenly serie pops up saying hey you usually get a mint mojito it fills on the way to work would
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:12.440]   you like me to do that for you that's creepy but it's you hit isly useful and i always thought it was
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:18.280]   useful with google so i'm glad to see apple kind of giving in on all of this yeah i i yeah so with
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:24.200]   that it's interesting like the way that a lot of people think of serie what what apple thinks of
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.800]   serie they think that it's just that voice that you talk to that can then give you the wrong answers
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:38.440]   back all the time but along with doing that it also is how they sort of clump in all of their
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:44.280]   smart and machine learning and all that jazz kind of features where uh serie can find contacts for
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:50.680]   you in your mail and then suggest that you add them to your your contacts app and yes also things
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.480]   like calling your grandma whenever it's her birthday so i see that it's in your calendar if you tap
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:01.160]   this button it'll automatically call you can make that call and things like automatically connecting
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.960]   whenever it automatically connects to the bluetooth in your car then it will suggest that you want
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.120]   to open the podcast app because maybe that's what you always listen to whenever you're in the car so
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:16.920]   that's serious suggestions and then and then there's also this kind of workflow stuff you can add
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.240]   your own and this actually also looks like if this than that right i mean it's kind of that kind of
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:29.080]   yeah i'm i'm wondering uh i'm curious as to how much discussion there might have been about if
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.680]   this than that integration or if if this than that will have the ability as developers to
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:43.080]   uh give their app hooks into this feature because i like the if this than the app yeah because
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.920]   remember that if this than that is multi-platform multi-device you can have an action that just works
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:55.080]   everywhere it's an action that it's a system that will basically whatever what you have no matter
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.640]   how you want it to interact with every other service or piece of hardware you have from like
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:05.160]   light bulbs all the way to tracking chips all the way to like google docs spreadsheets you can make
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.040]   a solution with if this isn't that than that um i know that this is the we're only seen the not
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:16.520]   even the first version of this for for apple but um it was it comes across to me as a really really
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:22.760]   cool and useful feature but kind of limited you're still limited to what developers want to expose
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:29.880]   to this feature and also what apple wants to expose to developers so if it i don't i would hate for
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:35.960]   to turn into like another version of automator where without apples continue its continued emphasis
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:40.360]   on how cool and how useful this is people just for might just forget that it exists and just never
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.240]   even really use it but they on also andy they didn't they talk about syri being able to integrate
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.640]   with apps to that you could enhance and this is something that really finally because syri has
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:55.560]   been kind of dopey if if app developers put the hooks in for syri integration they can make syri
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.720]   smarter just by putting that out you can make it smart by just putting that app on your phone or
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:06.280]   at least give or at least give extra functionality right i would i i don't know making syri smarter
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.800]   is well as an example when i when syri came out before apple bought it it worked with open table
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.520]   you could make reservations so presumably open table could add that to their app and then syri
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:22.200]   would be able at once again to make reservations through open table well that's a that's a different
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.760]   that should that should have already been i think that that was already a syri intent as they're
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:32.840]   called because there are other apps that can do reservations already so that that existed i
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:38.920]   think of as a iOS 10 because there was ride sharing there was payment apps there was restaurant
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:45.560]   reservations and a couple others and the new syri intents that were added as of iOS 12
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:52.200]   those are the what now it's a little bit more open and a little bit more that the intents aren't
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:58.920]   as specific so it's not like you can only use a pay app or you can only use a voice over IP
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:03.800]   app or these different things now it gets a little bit easier for developers to open up
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:10.440]   their it's sort of like that they have a name for but open up their apps to hook in with syri
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:15.000]   and then you'll get a little prompt inside of the app that you can tap on and then it connects it
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:21.320]   with syri but yes the i could see if this than that doing that because there are
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:28.360]   plenty of possibilities in these apps to just say okay i want this particular thing to be able to
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.600]   connect with syri so that all i have to do is say this phrase and syri will do it and i think in
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:38.680]   that sense it may not make syri smarter but it makes syri more useful right more customizable
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:44.520]   more tailorable it's it's i can't wait to play with this hands-on because there's
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:50.600]   it seemed to me during the demos and what i've read afterward that there are there are a lot of
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:56.040]   ways this could go very very wrong i don't think seriously i don't i don't think anybody would want
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:00.760]   their phone to like every time they wake up hi do you know that it's your cousin myra's birthday do
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.320]   you do you want to send her a third thing about it yeah and by the way this is usually the time
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.560]   that you check the you check the ventilation ducts in the heating system also isn't it time for your
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.200]   car to have an oil change and it's tuesday but do you want to do you want to find out traffic
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.200]   reports for that coffee place you should go to it's like please just let me go back to sleep now
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:25.560]   and there's a there's i really it was such a good keynote i really did spend i was the kind of
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.720]   keynote i like in which it gives me a lot to think about and one of the things i was thinking about
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:35.320]   particularly about this particular thing was what i wonder what the better solution is to give the
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.760]   user that level of control where they can define they can take these building blocks and basically
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.320]   build this workflow themselves and make sure that works for them or is it better to have something
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:50.600]   the way that the google assistant is trying to do it which is just being able to say like you know
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:56.200]   hey giermo turn off all the lights turn on the the fan blower and order me a copy i'm leaving
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.080]   the house and going to work and basically instead of having to actually write a list of instructions
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:06.120]   be able to just simply say here's what i want you to do and then eventually this an assistant
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.840]   saying do you want to do are you leaving the house do you want me to do what you did yesterday
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.960]   it's a it's an interesting way i think i think control is underappreciated i think a lot of
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.600]   people developers included they like the flashiness of hey look how automated this is when
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.920]   you can make a better better solution if you just let people build themselves and take
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.560]   responsibility for fixing things that aren't going quite correctly but interesting
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:37.880]   can i uh move to watch o s if we covered macos and uh and i guess i have covered all the cool stuff
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:43.320]   there's a lot there's a lot to unpack and of course not all of it was even in the keynote
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.720]   or in the state of the yeah or even in the state of the union yeah there was quite especially
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:53.160]   ios uh did not get much attention um at the at the state of the union because i think there was
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:59.880]   so much to cover and we know we we didn't go super in-depth again on some of those things and
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:05.480]   specifically like the screen time sort of nanny state features that people were
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.880]   complaining about it all did we yeah we talked about it on uh ios today uh this is of course in
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:19.640]   response to two things one most you know obviously the shareholder revolt in january with two of the
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:25.000]   uh two of the uh shareholders jana partners in the california teachers retirement fund
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.200]   said you got to do something about how addictive your iphone is but but also there's just this kind
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:36.360]   of current in the world it google's doing almost exactly the same kinds of things um and so this
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.520]   is good little more control little more information about how you're using your phone even the ability
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:46.360]   to say you've used instagram too much notice by the way in every case it was instagram facebook and
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:54.200]   youtube that were the that were the problem children i wonder why uh watch os i think one of the i
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.600]   think i have to say i have completely come around on uh on the watch uh i was very skeptical about
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:07.320]   it i thought it was a toy not very useful but as each iteration came out apple made it a bit more
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.720]   peaceful bit more useful and now with watch os five which comes out this fall and will work on
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:19.640]   everything except the original apple watch bastards bastards push to talk they're putting a next
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:27.320]   tell phone in your apple watch that's why i'm so i'm so worried about this one it's a great feature
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.280]   the ability to simply send a quick have like a two-way conversation using just either your mobile
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.560]   broadband or wifi that's fine that's perfectly natural but i know that i'm going to be on an
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:41.480]   Amtrak train and here hi well i'm on the Amtrak train
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:47.560]   that was the problem with next tell you remember annoying next tell phones were
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:54.840]   god i never came so close to tumbling us total strangers then you do realize that every eight
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:03.320]   seconds i get here like i don't want to so annoying yeah uh but and also i have the problem
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.760]   probably a not unusual problem that a lot of people very few people i know where an apple
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.480]   watch all the time my wife does not the one person i probably would use this with now maybe it'll
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:16.520]   convince her to wear her app she has an apple watch maybe it'll convince her to wear it
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.960]   uh but this is that's that's who you use it with your closest
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:25.960]   colleagues or friends use it was used heavily on construction sites uh you know that kind of
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.320]   situation i think this is a brilliant use of the apple watch very interesting use it's fast you
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:36.200]   do have to authorize specific people for for incoming and outbound so i think it'll be it'll be
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:43.800]   cool to watch but you're right it could be extremely annoying um uh podcast i'm happy that podcast
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.440]   will now appear on the watch and let you actually listen directly through the watch pocket cast has
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.000]   been able to the third party apps have been able to i think offer cast to but now apples podcast
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.920]   we'll do that that's good um going backwards finally we'll notice that you're working out
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.560]   which is something that uh sam's watches have done for a long time and i've been
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.080]   wishing that apple would do that because i always forget to start the workout till halfway through it
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:14.440]   now it will give you credit if you start halfway through and it will even say look your heart rate's
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:18.120]   going up it looks like you're working out would you like to start it it's only for walking running
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:24.200]   no i'm just having a really bad anxiety today just yoga they'll have yoga they'll have hiking
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:30.040]   uh better running features apples in an interesting position because people are really serious
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:36.200]   runners i think use garment and you know other you know more serious running watches um but
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.240]   this is slowly adding the features that some of these uh serious runners want like rolling miles
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.120]   and pace notifications and things like that yeah i don't even know what most of that stuff
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:53.880]   thing yeah me neither uh exercise what's that but you know it really did i think the apple watch is
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:59.800]   such a great story to keep following because they they really didn't know what they they knew what
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.920]   kind of a wristwatch they wanted to make that what would look like they hadn't the slightest clue
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.200]   what they wanted the thing to do and it really did take that and really to take a few years from
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.200]   the figure out that okay people are going to be buying it as a really great fitness watch and
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.360]   now they're finally i think with the with the new version they're trying they're figuring out
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.040]   how to actually integrate apps with it in a way that makes more sense than here is a here's a
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:28.600]   here's a constantly a flock of a hive of bees each bee represents a different app that you have to
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:33.080]   scroll to and find because we do we do think you're gonna want to do instagram on your watch
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.080]   instead of taking your phone out of your pocket having a much better experience i really like
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:43.480]   their demonstration of the new like next level actionable alerts from uh from apps where it's a
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.280]   way to make sure if if there's something that you need to respond to or that something has happened
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.920]   that would you would normally take out take your phone out for now instead of just here's three
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.960]   buttons yes no maybe it really lets you do things like no i want to call it i want to call a car right
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.840]   now it's these things that would take you only about 10 seconds on your phone but that 10 seconds
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.960]   is surrounded by time taking it out time unlocking it time getting to the app time getting to the
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:15.240]   feature so i think that a lot of people who who had this common sense not to buy version zero of
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:20.680]   the watch are gonna find that this is this is another okay well i actually i probably should buy a new
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.880]   one anyway okay fine uh but uh i think a lot of people are gonna it's it's i think that a lot of
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:32.680]   people who bought the watch early the i'd love to see a graph of how many days out of the year it's
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.400]   spent inside a drawer versus how many days out of the year it's spent on a wrist and that curve has
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.800]   been going up and up and up and now it's almost one i think with this version it could almost get
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.760]   to one to one not just again not just for a fashion watch but for this is worthwhile for me to have
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.800]   spent hundreds of dollars on this and to have to still charge it every couple of days no absolutely
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.360]   exactly right about that uh i had the series zero watch because i got i got it you know day one
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:03.160]   soon as it shipped i was uh in my hands and i was ready to wear it and over time it went into a
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:08.760]   drawer or well it didn't go into drawer it sat on its charger on my nightstand for you know multiple
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:15.640]   days and i go oh yeah i better put this on it would go on go off go on go off um i had a big heart
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:24.040]   thing happen uh where i ended up in the emergency room a couple times and so in order to to continue
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:31.080]   to track that information i wanted to uh upgrade my apple watch because the the most recent one had
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:35.240]   more heart tracking and you know sort of the heart rate variability and stuff that i've talked about
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:41.560]   before when i upgraded to this watch i wear this thing all the time every day all the time and it's
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.480]   not just because of those heart rate things but also because of everything else that apple is added
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:51.160]   to it so i think that you're you're dead on there like the series zero watch was fun but i ended up
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.640]   just sort of forgetting about it and this one it's not one of those things where i look down at my
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.520]   wrist and go oh yeah i guess i forgot to put that on it's i move out of my bedroom and then i
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.320]   realize oh no i forgot to put my apple watch on need to go back and and strap it on yeah it's become
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:12.440]   my uh my pocket pat now there you go my pocket that is that is the ultimate test you know that
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.960]   it's finally successful if not only not just that but if it's like if you're on the street about to
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:25.320]   get into your car like ah i'm wearing i'm wearing my my g my casio g-shock watch uh it's worth going
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.520]   but it's worth relocking my car going back inside and getting and getting my apple watch that's how
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:37.560]   much i ever lie on it now it's also i think uh a cautionary tale that it's that one shouldn't always
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.720]   judge apple on the first version of anything or any technology company yeah any kind of
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:48.120]   sometimes iteration can produce a really great product over time and i think the apple watch
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:53.480]   was less than useful initially and as i agree with you both it's now i i wear it every day and
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:59.480]   it is it is worthy of going back to get they did add one feature i'm very worried about i don't i'll
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:06.120]   have to wait and see how this works smarter serie uh you only have to raise it to your wrist for it
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:13.880]   to respond what he how's that gonna work i raise it to my wrist to look at what time it is
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.360]   um yeah i was writing during this so i didn't i was writing about something else during this i
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.720]   didn't even know that this is a feature so this is the first time i'm here here's what they write on
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:28.520]   this on the page raise to speak you no longer need to say hey serie just raise your wrist
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:35.960]   um and just say what and start talking uh serie i actually
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:41.400]   on the watch activates too often already but and and not enough both simultaneously
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:47.080]   when i don't want it and never works when i do want it i agree with that because whatever you
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.400]   the part you first said i was like no not really but yes i agree it activates too much not enough yeah
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.680]   too much and not enough um somebody's saying the chairman i do agree i feel really bad for the
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.440]   people who spent 17 000 dollars on a solid gold original apple watch that will not be upgraded
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.680]   i don't think i feel sorry oh i think i think anybody anybody who spent 17 000 dollars on a solid gold
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.480]   gadget watch they probably like eight days after they after they took it out of the box they they
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.400]   wanted they gave it to their kids who strapped bottle rockets to it and blew it up and already
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.680]   melted it down that's that was that was the market they decided they wanted to go for not education
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.240]   not middle and lower income buyers they wanted to get people who would buy a watch they absolutely
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:35.080]   don't give a damn wanted for rel they wanted Beyonce that's what they wanted they wanted just in timber
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:42.200]   lake um actually there's a there's a new show on uh i think it's HBO called the succession
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:48.200]   uh about very very very very rich people basically it's Rupert Murdoch and his children
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:55.320]   and but it's fiction and at one point uh it's the birthday for the old guy and it's this is not a
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:00.360]   spoiler it's just a moment you want to look for if you watch it and one of the son-in-laws
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:05.160]   desperately is trying to give him a nice gift and finally pins him to the wall because he's been
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.640]   avoiding him and says i wanted to get you something special and get in his a beautiful box inside
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.280]   it's a petech philip he opens it up says this is a petech philip and the guy says yeah i know it says
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.240]   that in the lid and then he says thank you no he never even says thank you just gives it to his
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.960]   a man who ends this sitting there on his left and it ends up at the end of the show on the wrist of
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:33.080]   uh of some of like the groundskeeper at the baseball field and i think you exactly right i think people
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:40.760]   who could spend 17,000 although 17,000 is a tiny amount compared to what a lot of these watches i'm
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.800]   sure that petech philip was a hundred thousand dollar watch yeah which is ridiculous i do i do
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:50.920]   i i you do make you do raise a good point i did i'm always a little bit skeptical a little bit i don't
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:57.640]   know judgmental of commentators who say oh this this is classic of how apple doesn't get it they
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.320]   never should have done this to begin with whether you're talking about a google product or an apple
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:07.640]   product or whatever it does take a while to people work really really hard on it uh they don't they
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.160]   they do know what they're doing but they don't know what they've got until they see a million people
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.880]   using this and they can figure out what they've really got that said i we can be critical of
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.880]   again launching a product that really had no focus for no upgrade
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:27.160]   as it turns out okay well that okay but that was i did get three what three years ago out of it four
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:32.920]   years out of it okay that's yeah but if you spent 17,000 that might not be and that's not exactly let's
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:39.480]   put it this way not exactly an heirloom so basically that basically that watches the fire festival of
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:44.600]   apple products or any of the people you've had the money to begin with you bought it for the wrong
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:52.920]   reasons so uh we can wrap it up by talking about tv o s i feel bad because apple's ambitions obviously
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:58.120]   we're to make the apple tv the set top box even alluded to that you know they want to replace that
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:05.400]   ugly cable box the scientific atlanta cable box in your underneath your tv with something more powerful
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.200]   uh and something that does a better job the cable companies historically have never wanted this
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:17.960]   they say no uh our it's our selling advantage it's our distinguishing feature is our the interface
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:23.640]   to our cable box it's where we put ads for other products we're not giving that to apple why why
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:28.200]   would we want to make it easier for our customers to buy movies and rent movies from someplace other
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:35.400]   than us yes precisely so nevertheless it hasn't stopped apple from you know keeping you know the
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.680]   apple tv app that's really what it's about is a centralized cables company style interface
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:44.840]   apple keeps talking about putting live news and sports programming on the apple tv they
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:51.480]   talked about it again yesterday uh and they even showed a scientific atlanta set top box and
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.440]   said this is the better set top box and then they had to admit and only spectrum charters
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:01.720]   gonna be using it and there's not a chance in hell anybody else including your cable company
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.160]   will go near this so if you're a good news if you're on spectrum get an apple tv
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.040]   why did why i don't even understand why spectrum agreed to that yeah that was my
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:16.280]   gosh like how did you get them and how did you get this yeah yeah there's no way
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.560]   Comcast or Cox or anybody else is going to go for it's a it's a weird it's a weird product and i
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.760]   talk and i'm not talking about how well or poorly they have built this thing because not only are they
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:32.360]   facing competent cable companies don't want to replace the their set top boxes now if you spend
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:38.120]   more than 28 cents on a new tv it comes with Netflix apps and youtube apps might even come
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:44.840]   with like essentially an entire broku uh stick built in so they they gotta have to they gotta have
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:49.080]   to come up they're gonna have to come up with a really compelling sell for people but here is
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:55.720]   what the apple tv can deliver that a forty dollar uh four case stick can't uh they well need that
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.760]   got one you may not care but they have Dolby atmos and Dolby vision they're the only streaming
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:05.960]   device that does both that's hdr and the new surround sound that comes from up there too
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:11.000]   yeah comes from above you atmos is awesome though i was very skeptical that atmos got wilkins in our
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.160]   home theater guy kept saying no it's great leo i finally you know we have an atmos theater finally
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:21.560]   in petaluma and i if i can i'll always go to see like infinity war or uh black panther in the atmos
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:27.480]   theater because it really does sound great and i'm at this point gonna probably now buy an atmos
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:34.280]   i need two extra speakers to fire up so i'm probably gonna upgrade to atmos and that's great
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:42.120]   that's a nice feature of the apple tv if you're into good audio i guess small market well it's it's
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.680]   this is a market i don't really understand and as an outsider i kind of wonder if someone is already
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:52.200]   invested in atmos are they're going to be satisfied with an apple tv yeah i'll tell you i am you know
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:50:00.520]   my 4k hdr tv looks really good with the apple tv and what's great is you'll buy a movie or there's
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:05.240]   a movie you've bought and they've automatically upgraded it i bought a 1995 movie the other day
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:12.200]   heat and it's 4k hdr that somebody took the time to make a really nice not a not blue ray but 4k
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:19.000]   hdr and it looks spectacular so no the apple tv is a great adjunct to a high end tv and if you have
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.320]   an atmos speaker system i think it will it will even make it a more appealing so yeah you're you're
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:31.560]   gonna have the blue ray box but i don't want to buy discs anymore that's not you know i have a
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.520]   uhd blue ray player but i and i buy discs for like something if it's really worth it the other thing
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.880]   that they promised is zero sign on this is something again if you use apple tv and you have a cable
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.040]   company and you use show time anytime or hbo go you know that every you know it seems like every
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:54.040]   time you sit down and watch one of these uh over the top apps on your apple tv it says okay now you
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.240]   got to reauthorize which means a log into the cable company and then to hand off and then
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:06.040]   we got to enter a code and it's a real pain in the butt zero sign on will be great it will only work
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:12.520]   with charter spectrum uh because the cable company has to cooperate and guess what they're not
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:19.400]   you think we just sign on they would i'd like why not why not that well they do cooperate actually
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:26.600]   if for a while i couldn't use um what was it i think i couldn't use hbo go on roku because my
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:34.920]   cable provider Comcast said no no you can't use a roku you got to watch but they finally i guess
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:44.120]   made a deal don't be i agree just fine you know i i think most that's a good reason for many people
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.680]   to like switch from their their current cable provider to charter because i mean it's it's a
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:53.320]   competitive market they're usually they're usually four or five cable companies competing
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:59.480]   for your business i know i hate that it's a monopoly you get what you get and you should be happy
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:06.520]   happy all right you have to be excited do you not have an apple tv andy clearly you don't i do
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:10.680]   oh you do you have to be excited about the new nasa screensaver
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:19.560]   okay that's nice i tried i don't keep my tv on long enough for those screensavers to like i
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:26.280]   if i go what i watch a show i watch a show and then i hold down the what is the menu button
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:30.760]   and then hit the sleep thing and it shuts off my television and shuts off the apple tv and shuts
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:34.920]   off the sound all that stuff all at once i don't keep it on long enough for it to go to those
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.880]   sleep screens um so the screensavers are cool but they just i don't know they don't they don't really
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:46.120]   affect me much i guess i just i hope that they have a large enough library now that i can actually
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:51.080]   in some app like at least have some influence because there there's some there's some of these
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:56.120]   sky panoramas i've seen i've seen so many times that the only effect they have on me is a
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.720]   i wonder how many like poor people villages were demolished to make one of those crazy stupid
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:08.280]   800 stories skyscrapers that were built by substandard slave labor like okay well how about
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:16.840]   how about we see like the the arkadia mountains okay there you go on well i leave my i guess you
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:21.800]   know when you get to be my age you spend a lot of time in the middle of shows getting up and going
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.920]   to the bathroom so i see more of the screensavers probably the new young people
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:33.960]   what i what i want is i want them to i want them to do like the nasa screensaver from the iss but
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:39.400]   through the kupola you know and so we can actually see like the the the the pains of glass whatever
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.360]   has been like velcroed the side arm as they they quickly cut away from it but i on the stream we
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:48.680]   saw an arm so they're they'll be skip but because i'm like you the the times i'm watching the
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:53.560]   screensaver or when like something wakes me up at 130 or okay we're at 4 30 in the morning because
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:59.880]   i'm usually in bed by the crack of 2 a.m i'm sorry i'm about to lie there but you know i we kind of
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:04.680]   cool flight those few first two or three seconds i'm in a darkened room and i'm seeing because i got
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:09.720]   into this big tv at the foot of my bed i think oh i'm on the international space station where are we
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:15.560]   oh look i'm in the kupola of northern northern afro is it comfortable bed for a spaceship
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.280]   i've got i've got experiments to run after i make my space burrito
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:27.240]   i'll tell you i see more of the apple tv screensavers on my mac because i have because you know you
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:32.040]   can eat yeah i love it it's and by the way i just found out you can do it on windows too so here's the
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:40.120]   the great wall of china the apple tv screensaver on a surface studio how about that well how about
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:45.560]   never well i never i just i'm waiting for apple to uh to block this
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:52.920]   any minute now i'm gonna get a notice wait a minute we we sense that leo is having fun and it's
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:58.760]   not monetizing any of our hardware this must not stay no apple i buy everything i even bought a
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:06.760]   10 core i mac pro apple you almost bought a macbook air just wasn't like i'm on the verge i'm
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:12.040]   on the edge of buying a macbook air god i don't know what i'm gonna do about uh getting a laptop
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:20.920]   chromebook i got that no i got i you know i'm i this isn't this isn't the time to start like
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:28.040]   another hour long discussion but i had i had a i had a situation with my macbook where uh so i was
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.480]   at the coffee shop and they gave me a cup of soda but they didn't tell me that they gave me a cup that
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:38.040]   had like a hole in the bottom of it so as soon as i poured it like caused this like my my laptop
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.320]   was fine i snatched it up before like the lake reached that but as as i was like putting like
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:49.080]   more piles of like towels on the table in the seat to help them clean it up i'm like my god if that
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:56.200]   macbook had been aced out i would be facing a really tough choice and pica i one of the things as i'm
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.920]   thinking about that maybe i would spend five hundred dollars on a really nice chrome book to tide me
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.800]   over for a year while i decide well i see what apple does with macbooks and if i see that if there's
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.760]   like a think pad that would much rather have instead i'm looking at that i'm looking at that
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:17.080]   Huawei Matebook Pro X Pro that looks sweet there's some really nice laptop system i think
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.960]   not coincidentally asus dumped a lot of new hardware yesterday one of them was so interesting it was
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:27.160]   it has a glass trackpad a big glass trackpad like the macbook but the glass trackpad is actually
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:33.480]   an OLED HD screen so you can like watch movies between your palms while you're working or
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:39.320]   certain apps can like project buttons and stuff to it i don't know how well that system would
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:44.440]   even work but boy if apple decided to implement something like that that would be that would
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.080]   that would get my attention and maybe my two thousand bucks pretty quickly i thought i caught
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:54.200]   my attention to andi i thought this is the coolest thing i've ever seen this is what the touch bar
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.160]   could have been in space really a touch bar but where the trackpad is and of course the trackpad's
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:04.440]   glass is no reason for it not to be a screen i don't know i'm very tempted this looks like a
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:10.760]   very nice laptop as well i it's it's expensive though it is pricey it is spandy well they didn't
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:17.320]   say it price did they oh yeah i started 2300 bucks yeah starts at that's the cheap one that's the
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:22.840]   without the air conditioning and only the amff factory
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:29.320]   starts shipping in mid-july so i have time to save my pennies the ux 580 it's got a
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:36.280]   uh 1080 display where the trackpad is five and a half inch 1080p's display and it's a 4k display
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:44.600]   itself asus makes nice gear forgive me if it's ignorant why not uh microsoft surface thingy
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:50.520]   surface book or surface this is a surface i think that the there i mean for a laptop how can we
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:57.160]   don't go here's the beauty there i have several of them that the the beauty of the windows ecosystem
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:02.680]   something alien i'm sure to you my cesargent is there are like thousands of manufacturers and
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:09.720]   each of them has a different take on what a laptop or a desktop should be and the and i love the the
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.120]   the varied ecosystem it's promised i hate windows 10 i'd so much rather use mac
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:19.240]   but when it isn't as bad as it used to be and so i kind of bite the bullet and
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:26.120]   i that sort of studio is just so isn't this this is awesome uh-huh and to be honest that that helps
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:32.360]   that helps out uh mac users as well because apple as we've seen in so many ios features that got
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:37.240]   shown off yesterday they are paying attention to what is what other companies are doing if there's
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:42.680]   a if there's a feature that they think is working great they say all right that's great we're let's
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:48.280]   let's move and let's do it ourselves uh craig federigi when uh he was uh talking to wired about uh
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:54.920]   about the new marsupan sort of features uh was asked about once again but well how about does this
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:59:00.520]   mean does ios code running on macs mean that you're moving towards like a touchscreen mac and he was
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.880]   saying he was able to say explicitly that no we we haven't seen that been we haven't seen touch
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:10.680]   screen on windows machines done in such a way that force makes us think ooh we should have the
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:16.600]   man he's so wrong it's just that's just i i just i disagree but the thing but the i just agree
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:21.160]   excuse me i disagree with him as well i agree with you but the fact but the fact that windows
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:25.800]   because this is this is an apple and mac like base podcast the fact that there are so many like
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:31.320]   crazy mutations walking out there it does allow apple to look at that yeah see what's going on
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:36.680]   maybe maybe that we don't want to do touch screen but maybe this idea of having a screen that folds
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:41.640]   a little bit more is kind of interesting you know they they have to again they everyone inside apple
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:47.640]   has to use apple products so if they are ever envious of someone with a think pad that feature
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:52.600]   on the think pad will get discussed internally you can be sure yeah i i mean i have to say i i
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:57.880]   reason i don't buy a surface uh book to answer your question i had a surface book not such not such
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:04.200]   good hardware oh and i don't like detachable uh keyboards uh i want a real keyboard i pretty much
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:09.880]   stick with lonovos this is the the new aces and by the way this also has the i9 processor and it has
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:17.560]   the octane and then it has this weird now this is this is just a weird thing uh but and i hated
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:22.120]   the touchpad and maybe this is just another touchpad but at least your fingers are already there
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:27.400]   yeah and see i'm all about that sort of external i know i know it's interesting but that sort yeah
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:33.960]   that key that shortcut type thing i've thought about getting one of those uh elgato stream i have
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.360]   a stream cast i love it they're so cool but i only use it for one thing playing sound effects on the
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:43.560]   radio show so it's not it's not all that useful but it's it's pretty cool
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.080]   hey let we got take a break we got to kick get going here steve gibson's champing at the bit
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.680]   to do security now uh we're going to get your picks in a second prepare your picks my friends
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:59.320]   but first let's talk about something apple owns for a change texture texture is the world it's
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:07.080]   netflix for magazines it's awesome uh i'm a magazine fan i know magazines are uh i've been around for
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:11.480]   a long time but i just feel like some of the best writing the best journalism that's going on now
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:17.560]   is done in the atlantic in the new yorker and wired magazine uh in rolling stone in fact every
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.400]   week or every month there's something i want to read in one of those magazines if i were to
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:27.480]   subscribe to them all well not only would cost me a lot of money but my coffee table would buckle
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:33.160]   under the weight of all that paper texture so much better it's a hundred two hundred of the best
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:40.440]   magazines in the country all the ones i mentioned national geographic shutter bug macworld pc magazine

[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:54.200]   get back issues you get features you can't do in print like video and if you like photography
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.920]   when you look at pictures in shutter bug or national geographic on texture you're not getting
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:03.320]   some kind of badly printed screened version of the picture you're getting all the details you can
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:10.040]   zoom in you could pixel people it's fantastic all recipes lots of cooking stuff sunset there's
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.800]   magazines i probably wouldn't subscribe to sunset but there's always something interesting in there
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:19.160]   at age billboard magazines really fun to look at the hot 100 i'm not going to subscribe to
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.960]   billboard or even buy it a single issue just to do that but it's there so i can look at it whenever
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:30.600]   i want to texture is amazing it's the magazine app unlimited access to more than 200 of the best
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.200]   magazines all in one place get complete issues get back issues anytime anywhere all in one app stay
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.840]   connected to the biggest and best stories today with texture and right now you could try it free
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:47.880]   for a week i want you to do this give it a try texture.com/twit why wait to start reading the
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:53.800]   latest issues of your favorite magazine get immediately unmingled by the u.s postal service
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:03:03.320]   at texture.com/twit texture.com/twit i think there's one magazine i still subscribe to because
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.640]   it's just wearing out all the other magazines i just let the subscriptions wear out and i use
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:15.800]   them on texture it's fantastic and dosh trick and mica sergeant you got a pick for us i do i do this
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:21.480]   is a i know i talked about mophie before on i i don't know what show but i really dig mophie's
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:27.480]   wireless charging capabilities and they just came out with something called the charge stream
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:35.320]   travel kit and in this little pack it's got like a nice little buckle on it comes a cord for
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.880]   plugging in the charger as well as an in-car port so that you can plug it in and in your vehicle
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:49.160]   and then one for the nightstand at the hotel and last but not least is the charge stream mini
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:56.680]   now this is a wireless charging pad and what i like about it is not only does it it's kind of
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:01.720]   angled so whenever it sits flat on your your desktop you can put the the phone on top of it and it kind
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:07.080]   of it's it's angled so you can see what's on it but my favorite thing i don't know why i'm a big nerd
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:14.280]   for micro charging what is it micro foam it's like micro suction foam that's right here on the top
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:19.000]   and so it holds on to your phone really nice so i've noticed that you know when i sit my phone down
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.800]   on it despite that angle like you feel as soon as you sit it down and why that's important is if
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:29.000]   you're if you're laying in the dark or something like that or you are traveling and you can't quite
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.720]   look at your phone you feel whenever it makes that connection and it's pretty good about
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.800]   not needing perfect placement as long as you sort of get it somewhere it somewhere in the middle
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:45.080]   there then it will latch onto the device and and start to charge it the one thing that i will
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:53.080]   note about it is it is only five watts of of wireless charging so it will take a while to
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.840]   to fully charge up your device but if you're just using it for overnight or you're kind of having
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:02.440]   it sitting around to just be a place to drop off your phone for a second it's pretty nifty and like i
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:11.720]   said it's brand new so it's a 50 bucks for the whole kit and kaboodle and i quite like it very
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:19.880]   nice thank you very nice andy and not co what's your pick of the week oh we've muted you
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:27.240]   i can't hear you oh no i can't hear you andy and mute
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:34.520]   sorry my apartment here yes uh my pick of the week is not brand new but it was the first like
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:40.680]   bluetooth speaker that like actually got my got my attention and got my love after i bought it this
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.360]   is the anchor soundcore nano it's about the size of like a kind of marshmallow they sell for like
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:52.200]   toasting in front of campfires so we're not we're not talking but that's that's still impressive
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:57.080]   but so we're not talking about room filling like home pod type sound but the
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:04.840]   i found so many uses for this number one yes it's so tiny that uh that uh why not just having in
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:09.320]   your laptop bag i certainly always have it with me when i travel so i can definitely hear music like
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:13.800]   in the my hotel room bathroom without having to crank it up in the big in the main room and like
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:19.080]   i know the neighbors uh the sound is surprisingly good even though again this is like two inches wide
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:25.640]   so it is like it has base it has like texture to it it has enough loudness that's actually if it's
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:30.440]   anywhere in the room with you it will definitely be a better thing if you've got like just next to
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:36.440]   your your your keyboard uh on your laptop as you're working that's just enough extra oomph to sort of
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.160]   give it to you but the thing that really has gotten uh got made it uh almost an essential thing is
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:46.200]   that it is now like what i always if if ever i'm going on like a long bike ride and i definitely
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:51.240]   or long long walk and i want to listen to podcasts i will actually just like clip this to like the
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:57.800]   shoulder uh of like my laptop bag or of my of my backpack and it's i don't have to crank it up it's
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:02.760]   loud enough that i can certainly enjoy the music and enjoy the podcast but both of my ears are not
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:07.960]   being covered up by headphones so it's i feel like it's much much safer even safer than having just
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:13.800]   wearing one of my ear one of my air pods and leave my other my other ear free uh and during that one
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:21.720]   day with during the one day that was 87 degrees between 51 degrees and like 38 degrees last week i
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:25.880]   did go to the beach and then i still used it there because i'm sitting like at the beach i'm reading
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:31.640]   my reading my Kindle and again i don't necessarily want to have earpods earplugs in my ears all the
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:36.200]   time because it's just uncomfortable and i also don't want to crank up this blue law a huge bluetooth
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:41.080]   speaker and annoy everybody i just want to be able to enjoy my music or my audiobooks or whatever
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:47.080]   and the fact it's only like 16 bucks you can take a flutter on that for 16 bucks it's an anchor device
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:52.680]   so it's really well made with just one button i don't think it's waterproof but it's rubberized
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:57.880]   on the on the back so it'll it's i've had it outside like not in pouring rain but certainly in the
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:02.360]   sort of like drizzly sort of stuff and it survived that really nice uh the battery is not going to
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:07.800]   last you a day and a half like some of the bigger uh bigger bluetooth devices well but it'll last at
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:14.760]   least four or five hours and it will also work as a as a microphone if you're using a speaker
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:19.240]   phone so basically again it's small enough that hey why may as well take it with me it's cheap
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:23.640]   enough that hey amaze will buy it and it's one of those things where once it was inside my office
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:27.560]   it turned out to be exactly the right solution for so many different things so that's why it's
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:33.560]   available in silver and black operator standing by so nice to have a speaker phone that size that's
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:38.280]   kind of cool yeah i guess it's i guess just the right size i don't need something the size of a
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.240]   loaf of bread uh and i certainly don't have room to pack something the size of even a sandwich roll
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:52.280]   then i've tried to mark the price of $50 barbecue marshmallow size yeah i love it i've been using
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:57.000]   this uh service for a long time and i think i finally really want to tell i've told people about
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.480]   it before but it's cross-platform it's called keybase and i know you know about this market mica because
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:06.760]   i saw you just you just joined it so i originally went to keybase because it was a way to kind of
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:13.800]   maintain your pgp key to make it public it allowed you if you if you if i log in or go to keybase.com
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:22.680]   keep sorry keybase.io/leoloport i can see you know kind of verify leo loport you can see all the
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.280]   websites that are verifiably mine you could find you can get my if you want you can get my public
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.480]   key there so you could send me encrypted email or verify my email because i use pgp to sign my
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:40.200]   email but keybase has gotten really useful in a lot of ways and the thing that kind of convinced me
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:47.800]   to to tell you about it is microsoft buying github i know that sounds a little weird but there are a
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.680]   lot of people who are fleeing github and looking for other ways to do get and one of the things key
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.560]   bases had for some time which is very interesting is an encrypted file system by the way this is
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.840]   completely free open source they're commissioning a third party audit so you can verify there's
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:08.520]   mica sergeant i ought to follow him when you follow somebody on keybase that means when their pgp key
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:15.240]   changes you'll get a notification you can uh you can privately chat them in fact it has very slack
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:22.440]   like uh chat capabilities which is kind of neat uh and it's free again it's free you can create a team
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:30.040]   chat so if you have a bunch of people um on a team i should tell you about this karsten because i'm
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:37.640]   alone on the twit staff team chat fully encrypted uh history forever it's it's pretty interesting
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:44.120]   but the reason i've been uh excited about it is with github disappearing it is a really great way
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:50.120]   to use git now this isn't for publicly posting your software this is for teams and individuals who
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:57.000]   want to use a repository for not just for code i use it for code and for my dot files dot files
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.880]   are good example dot files are the setup files that i use on linux machines and on max that's
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:07.240]   it can figure everything and in there are my ssh keys and my pgp keys because when i get a new
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.320]   machine i want those all installed well i wouldn't want to put those publicly on github or git lab
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.640]   or anywhere but i do want them on a git server so that i can update it from different
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.600]   sources and i can make sure it's always up to date and i can get it whenever i install on a new machine
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.080]   so putting it here is great because it's trust no one encryption no one has access to it even
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:31.080]   the key base folks it's encrypted using my pgp key nobody can else can access it but i can use it i
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.840]   can use git to access it and modify it um i also put financial records things i don't want anybody
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.920]   to see completely encrypted but i want them available in other machines tax records uh you know
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:49.880]   passport images things like that really a nice program and absolutely free key base dot i-o
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:59.160]   i there's a lovely picture of you mica thanks uh it is it is it's really kind of i think it's a
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:04.760]   hidden gem i think a lot of people don't know about it and they and they really ought to it is a
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:12.360]   very useful tool it's completely cross-platform windows mac android and ios and of course linux
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:18.920]   i'm and start on everything i use and i get immediately i get all of these benefits and a lot more and
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.800]   they're really getting bigger chris coin created he took the money he made when he sold ok cupid
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.840]   and sparked no oh yeah he and he yeah he was a founder and he took the money said you know what
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.240]   i'm gonna do something for the public good and he did this completely open source and free i
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:39.000]   imagine at some point because they have an encrypted file system they might start charging for that
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:46.120]   because right now i'm getting free storage from them which is awesome it's uh it's kind of an amazing
