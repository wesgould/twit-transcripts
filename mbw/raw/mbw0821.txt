[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   It's time for a Mac break.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.800]   Weekly Renee Ritchie is in Cupertino.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.280]   So hey, great news.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.560]   Micah Sargent is here with us along with Andy and Aco
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.720]   and Alex Lindsay.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.440]   And of course, what are we going to talk about?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440]   WWDC.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.880]   How good is the M2?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   Which laptop should you get?
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.880]   What about the new Mac OS Ventura, iOS 16?
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.680]   And in my opinion, maybe the biggest announcement of all,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800]   a new look for iPad OS.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.320]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.800]   I'm Mike Break Weekly.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.640]   Podcasts you love.

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.680]   And I think we have a little something to talk about today.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.600]   Renee Richie is still in Cupertino.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.320]   But we do have a message from him, which
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.560]   we will pass along in just a second, filling in for Renee.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.840]   The host of iOS today, my co-host yesterday during the event.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.120]   Wearing a lovely cardigan, it's Micah Sargent.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.480]   That's very nice.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.080]   Very nice.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   Thank you.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   Of course, good to have you in Tech News Weekly.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.000]   Andy Inaco is here, WG.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.480]   B.H.R. Ballston.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.800]   And Mr. Alex Lindsay, who probably has been spending
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   the last 24 hours talking about--
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.080]   It sure feels like it.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.040]   How's your voice?
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.720]   Are you sick of it?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.960]   Yes.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.880]   Oh no, I'm excited.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.880]   It's like I get different visions of it.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.600]   Every conversation is slightly different.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.120]   Right.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.800]   So I've had like--
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.320]   That makes sense.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   This is my fourth one.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.320]   Everybody who looks at it has another angle.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.200]   It was a good event.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.280]   A lot of protein there.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.520]   Actually, let's start with that.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.800]   It was a good-- you feel like it was a good event, Andy.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.600]   Yeah, especially because it's a developer conference.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.120]   But obviously, the first keynote is always intended
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.520]   towards the press and towards consumers.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   And boy, did they give particularly consumers
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.000]   a lot to think about, mostly thinking
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.520]   that if you bought new hardware in the past year or two,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.760]   oh boy, we're going to pay things off to you, not with just--
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   whereas last year with the new CPUs, a lot of it was, hey,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.600]   look at these charts about power consumption.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.240]   Look at these charts about speed compared to Intel
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.640]   or compared to other things that we're doing.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.920]   Now we're basically saying, look at the things that--
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.000]   look at the new features that we're
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.920]   going to be able to give you that are more than, hey, look,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.880]   you can do search and replace within an email.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.480]   It's like, no, here's something that you
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.280]   can do with your iPad that you were never able to do before.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.480]   And yes, you're cutting off people who aren't using M1 iPads.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400]   But this is us telling you that this is why, this is the future.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120]   This is why you should probably start replacing your old Macs
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.920]   with new Macs.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.320]   Maybe this is also why you should start replacing
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.960]   your old Windows machines with new Macs and new iPads,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.320]   because clearly, we have such a detailed roadmap
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.040]   for where we're going with everything
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.840]   and how everything's going to work together.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   So yeah, this is a very, very--
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.040]   I'm really excited about what I'll
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   be able to do with my hardware at the end of the year.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.920]   Alex, what was the consensus in the office hours?
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   Was this a good WWDC?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.800]   I think a lot of people were pretty excited about it.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.040]   I think that it didn't have the whiz bang.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   I think it just had lots of good little features
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.920]   that, again, as Andy said, you see everything starting
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   to pull together.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   So all of these different pieces of hardware,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.840]   I think the people really wanted a Mac mini.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.320]   So there was a strong desire for a Mac mini
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.960]   that would be on the M2, as opposed to the laptops.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.920]   I think that there was a surprise
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   that there was very little discussed around AR/VR.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   Very little like zero.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.400]   That was a big surprise.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.800]   It was like a special audio.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.000]   It was like a sentence.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240]   And then we've done some special audio, and then they moved on.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   And so it definitely did not get much--
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.960]   so a lot of us that are paying attention to that,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.640]   paid attention to that, that nothing happened there.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.040]   But I think that-- and nothing with Apple TV,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   the OS is pretty much the same as it was.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.160]   It still feels like there's a lot of pent-up hardware there
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.520]   that there's pent-up capabilities in the hardware
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   that haven't been unleashed.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.880]   And so we're kind of curious as to when that might happen.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.480]   And then as far as the actual production,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.600]   we thought it was pretty good.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.920]   Pretty good.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.480]   Wait a minute, Craig Fittaguridi running--
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.160]   That was the best part.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.680]   Careful.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   I was talking about that.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.720]   That was the best--
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.600]   The Bionic Man.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.120]   Best part in the whole of the entire thing was him running.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   Like the running man thing with Craig,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.080]   it was unbelievably hilarious.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.240]   I mean, it was just so well done, because it was so cheesy.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.760]   I mean, they were just blowing cheddar all over the walls.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.720]   And--
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.320]   They kind of brought back--
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.760]   because I remember the last event,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.440]   they didn't really have a lot of those transitions.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   So much fun.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.200]   I was really glad they brought the transitions back,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.360]   because they had a lot of fun.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.720]   Most of them were a little weird.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.920]   Like it was like, oh, they didn't quite work that one out.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   But some of his were really, really good.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.000]   Like the elevator from--
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.800]   The elevator was pretty good.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.840]   The top to the bottom of the stage and so forth.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.440]   That looked like a get smart elevator.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.920]   That's what I said, get smart.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.280]   At first, I was in mission impossible.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.440]   James Bond, but no, it was get smart.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   Get smart.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.280]   Exactly.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.000]   So it was-- I think I was glad that they didn't try
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.040]   to do it back on stage.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.720]   I think that we would find a stage keynote
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.040]   to be super slow now, compared to what we're used to,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   as far as how fast they transition from one thing
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   to the next.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   And the fact that the performances are way better,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.360]   because they get to do them over and over again.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.280]   And so I think--
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.000]   And they did show it to a live audience.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.240]   So the live audience was outside on the Apple campus.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.520]   They had a big screen setup.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.080]   We saw a lot of tweets and pictures from--
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.920]   The Gelly D. Wall, yeah.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.520]   From people.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.280]   And it was very much like a warm-up act.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.240]   So Tim came on and said, hi, and live.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.360]   And person and Craig came on and said, wave.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   And then they said, OK, now it's 10 o'clock.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.960]   Let's do the show.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.040]   And then everybody just sat watching that.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.080]   And that presumed they were--
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.320]   in fact, I think I'm pretty sure there
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.200]   were demonstration labs and hands-on after.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.960]   I thought it was great.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.640]   They had to meet the developers' conversation afterwards.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.680]   So right after the event was over,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.920]   developers from Apple who work on SwiftUI,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.040]   who work on the different operating systems
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.680]   were standing out in the crowd at these different tables.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   And then people could walk up to them right after the event
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.240]   was over and have conversations with them.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.400]   And the SwiftUI table, I was told, was incredibly packed.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.360]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.600]   Well, that's developers.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.520]   What did you think, Micah?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.400]   Was it all that?
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.080]   Or just so?
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.120]   For me, no.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.200]   So well, OK, so I'll say that there are quite a few little
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   features and changes that I am absolutely excited about.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   I'm looking for digging into even more.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.240]   But the things about which I was the most excited or hopeful
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.280]   for were not announced.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.160]   And of course, I'm an odd person out, so I realized that.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.400]   But I am very much into the smart home and automation
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.080]   and things like that.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.760]   And there was no mention of some of the location stuff
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.720]   that I wanted to check out.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.520]   However, one thing that I think we all need to do as journalists,
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.200]   if we do have developer accounts, is go to Apple's website
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.080]   and look at the sessions that are coming out,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.040]   because I kind of had to shut my mouth and call me skippy,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.760]   because there were several different videos that
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.920]   are coming out that are covering the things that I
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.120]   wanted to have covered.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.200]   They just didn't-- they just was a room on stage.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.200]   It was an hour and 48 minutes.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.720]   It was jam-packed, and they didn't get to nearly everything.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.320]   Here is Craig Federighi's running man transition.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   I'll turn on the sound so you can hear it.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.280]   The iPad OS.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.080]   Slow motion, hair waving in the breeze.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.200]   Somebody said it's a head and shoulders commercial.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.160]   Oh, that's so great.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.960]   He's looking good.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.600]   They're doubling down on Craig as their guy, aren't they?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.400]   He's the use-boosh between meals,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.920]   between like meaty, like challenging courses of a meal,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.040]   where he's got his dad jumps in about their crack naming team.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.280]   And after their hard work on the M1 and M2,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.240]   they came up with Ventura.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.400]   We'll talk about that in a little bit as the next Mac OS.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.200]   I like the joke about the Apple car charging,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.080]   wasn't that like a slide that was like in the background?
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   Oh, I missed that.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.920]   OK, yeah, we got to look at some of Rizzomeaster eggs.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.680]   Renee Richie was there, and he posted in our Discord
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.600]   images of the Pokemon gyms on the Apple campus.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.840]   There's one in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   There is a, what do they call that?
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.400]   Battle Dome, that's the gym.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   In the Apple Park Visitor's Center, Battle Dome.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.920]   And then the AR Park model has another pokey stop.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.480]   So there's two pokey stops in a gym apparently.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.760]   Inside the ring.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.040]   There's a whole bunch of things announced
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.840]   in what we get our Pokemon location.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.360]   Yeah, thanks Renee.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   Oh, no, no, that's perfect.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.880]   It's like, the problem with the people who
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.800]   let go to these things in person is that you often
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.840]   come away with just the stuff that everybody got
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.880]   just by watching the video and/or just by sending off
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.760]   a few emails.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.120]   I absolutely admire Renee for saying, look,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.520]   one of the few things that I can do
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.320]   that I can only learn if I'm actually
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.360]   here boots on ground is what are the Pokemon spots?
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.520]   And also, is Apple allowing stuff like that
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.120]   to happen on their campus?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.200]   So yes, I want them to do everything
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   they can possibly do.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.360]   If they can have a metal detector,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.560]   if they can have one of those ghost detectors
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.920]   to look for EMF fields, I hope they do everything
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.160]   they possibly can while they're allowed inside
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.360]   the square circle.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.760]   And your ARP pictures here, ARP pictures.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.960]   So they didn't have a hands-on, I guess.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.240]   Maybe I was, because I saw pictures
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   of up close of the new MacBook cars,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.160]   but apparently this was the display.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.240]   And Tim Cook is standing in front of it,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.760]   of the new MacBooks.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.800]   So you could kind of see them at a distance,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.440]   but it looked like Tim was keeping people
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.560]   from touching it.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.880]   Some of them did get like,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.960]   I just didn't think I got her hands on.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.840]   Well, no, actually some of the YouTubers
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.880]   got their hands on time to shoot video
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   like with holding it, not using it, of course,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.640]   but at least they got some touchy-feely time.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.720]   - Yeah.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   - Oh, okay, so let's go.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.120]   We're gonna, oh boy, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.320]   There's a new, you know, this is kind of what you'd expect.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.960]   We knew they would talk about the next Mac OS,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.160]   it's called Ventura, the next iOS, iOS 16.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.480]   Those will presumably be out in the fall,
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.760]   they didn't say specifically,
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.360]   but they did say developer versions are out as of yesterday
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.920]   and the public betas will be out next month.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.720]   So we'll all get to try that.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Also that new iPad OS, which is very interesting.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.400]   Let's not get, and then the new Watch OS 9.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.680]   So I think we have to go through this bit by bit.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.040]   They didn't mention TVOS,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.360]   but Micah has put a link to a 9 to 5 Mac article
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.320]   where they talked about it.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.040]   - I wanna start with the M2 'cause I don't know.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.000]   That's for me, I was looking for hardware.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.400]   Remember last week we, Renee and everybody,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.880]   we're lowering expectations saying
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.600]   they might not announce hardware.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.680]   I think supply chain is of course still a big concern,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.600]   but they were able to announce the M2.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.840]   And on tech had a pretty good description
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   of what's going on in the M2 as far as they could deduce.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.200]   Obviously nobody's got hands on
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   until we have benchmarks, nobody will really know.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.760]   But it's, you know, it's interesting.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.960]   And on says they're basically on an 18 month cadence.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   They also answered one question
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.600]   which I'm sure Renee will answer further
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   when he gets here next week.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.760]   It is, it seems to be the SOC built,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.000]   or a derivative of the A15, which is what we expected.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.160]   The M1 was a derivative of the A14.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   Clock speeds are unknown on the M2,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.520]   but it is a bigger chip, 20 billion transistors,
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.200]   which is, you know, 25% more than the M1,
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   and five billion more transistors than the A15 in your iPad.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.840]   So it's not an A15, it's more than,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.600]   but it's based on the architecture of the A15.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.200]   Second, they called it the second generation
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.360]   five nanometer process, which Anand says is likely TSMC's
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.000]   N5P line, which is also used for the A15.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.400]   N5P offers improved performance characteristics
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.840]   versus N5, but not density improvements.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.800]   So that's why the chip is a little bit bigger.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.240]   You have to make room, it's not more dense.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.160]   You know, Apple went through a few of the, you know,
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   the quilt, I love that term by the way, Mike.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.800]   I'd never heard that before.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.160]   - That was Andes. - Was it?
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.320]   - Yeah. - The feature quilt.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.680]   - Feature quilt. - Feature quilt.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   - The feature quilt for this had a lot of details,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.640]   but you know, as always, until you get your hands
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   on the thing, it's kind of hard to know
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   exactly what it is.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.640]   - A lot of it just looks very incremental.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   I'm surprised that they're going,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.080]   it's stuck with just two Thunderbolt ports supported
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.400]   as, 'cause that was the, for a lot of people,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.360]   myself included, that's one of the few real bottlenecks
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.240]   of owning a machine that has an M1.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.680]   And it seems, I wonder if Apple is making that sort of
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.280]   a distinction between people who need to upgrade to
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.440]   one of the Macs or one of the pro CPUs
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800]   that know you're gonna get just two Thunderbolt's
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.560]   probably limited to just two displays,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.160]   no matter what machine you have, a lot of the stuff.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.000]   I was reading the same Anantec tear down as you did.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.560]   And a lot of the stuff is, when it would impress me
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.760]   is that a lot of it is not so much working,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.480]   not as much doing calculations faster so long,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   as much as moving data in and out faster.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   Like there's a more shared L2 cache,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.840]   more memory, that's a big deal is accessing more memory.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.080]   So having a 24 gig ceiling instead of 16,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.480]   which when you think that the pro and the ultra CPUs
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   are basically scaled up versions of the M1 and the M2,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.000]   you have to imagine this will also mean that when we get
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.480]   to the pro series and the Macs, that means that you will
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   also have like a convergent expansion of top amount of memory
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   available to those machines too, faster DDR5 instead of DDR4.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.280]   So that's a higher bandwidth.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.480]   So it's incremental.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.840]   I think, I'll just say that I wonder if a lot of people
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.280]   listening have the same adjustment that I'm making
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.360]   that whenever I see, oh, this isn't the M1,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.400]   this is the M2, that puts me in the mind of,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.680]   oh my God, this is going to be a whole new redesign,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.840]   this is going to be able to do magical things
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.320]   that it wasn't able to do before.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.640]   It'll smell like strawberries all the time
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.400]   when you're working with them.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.120]   Whereas it's more like the iPhone CPU upgrades where,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   yes, it's basic, or when Intel has the,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.000]   you still have an i7 processor,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.040]   but it's a new version of the i7 processor,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.200]   so it's going to be incrementally faster.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.800]   - Yeah, I thought 24 gigs was interesting,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.720]   although you still, the base model,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   according to the Apple Store, still eight gigs,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.760]   which is kind of nutty, I guess,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.080]   they, do they turn off three of the four banks
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.680]   or something, I don't know what they're doing.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   It's a little annoying.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.120]   Maybe that's a binning issue,
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.520]   they may not have the yields to do all 24 gigs,
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.040]   although I guess now it'll be 24, 48, 96, 192,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.880]   like the multiples, which is interesting.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.560]   It is DDR5, as you pointed out,
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.480]   100 gigabytes a second memory bandwidth.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.400]   That's a big increase, that's 50%.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.240]   - That's 50%.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.200]   - Did your people, Alex, get excited over that,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   'cause I know from the point of view of a GPU,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.240]   having very fast unified memory available,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.680]   and a lot of it available to GPU is a big deal.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.520]   - Well, that's been something
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.600]   that a lot of people are paying attention to,
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.560]   is that unified memory architecture.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.800]   So for many of the things that we want to do,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.920]   everything from iOS to the Mac OS,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.880]   being able to have that work is very complex.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.520]   This morning, we were talking about audio, video,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.880]   WWC updates, and we had the CTO from Filmic Pro,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   from FilmicCon, as well as Lead Engineer from Fusion
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.240]   and the Lead Engineer from Mix Effect.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.360]   And one of the things they talked about
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.520]   is how a lot of them are writing to the metal.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.880]   I mean, we're writing to metal,
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   but writing, like they are on the exotic solution process
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.360]   where they're just running out of,
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.200]   they're just writing out the resources.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.960]   - To get every inch of speed out of it.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   - Yeah, yeah, even on the card.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.600]   - On non-sexist, the memory bandwidth
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.160]   is often a bottleneck with GPUs.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.600]   So getting a faster bandwidth,
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.400]   but they also point out DDR5 is not new.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   The M1, a Pro, a Max and Ultra had DDR5,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.840]   which I did not know.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.960]   It was only the original M1 that was stuck with DDR4.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.600]   Still, so that 100 gigabit, you know,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.880]   that 50% improvement is only over the original M1.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.120]   But still, this is important and it's a lot of memory
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.240]   and the faster it gets, the better it gets.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   They also, the biggest change in the M2 is not CPU so much
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.560]   as GPU, were they excited about that?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.680]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.320]   I mean, it's just gonna mean as we go through,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.400]   the GPU is used in so many places.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.920]   You know, it's everything, you know,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.240]   from obviously Apple's talking a little bit about scaling,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   but it's also just every single part of what we do
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.600]   from 3D models to video to even audio
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.640]   is affected by the GPU performance.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.200]   And so increasing the GPU capacity as well as increasing
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.920]   the speed is incredibly important for what we work on.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   - They claim 18% faster CPU.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.520]   And again, we don't know what the clock speed is,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.360]   so it's unknown really what that means
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.680]   'cause the efficiency cores are different
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.840]   from that performance cores, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.560]   - And I think that the problem really is,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.800]   is that a lot of the traditional testing
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.680]   that people would do around clock speed,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.520]   around individual small tests aren't as accurate
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.400]   because when you start talking about the throughput speed,
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   the, you know, how it's managing all of the data,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   it may not measure on a clinical test
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.560]   that that's a lot faster.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.200]   And then it actually becomes a lot faster as you go.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.880]   - Sure, 'cause your renders faster,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.200]   even though the CPU is a faster,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.800]   everything's moving right through the--
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.640]   - And is a hundred gigabytes--
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   - And even that second a fast, is that fast?
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.480]   - Yes, it is.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   - As far as I know, I actually don't know
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.680]   that number well enough.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.360]   So I don't know if that's fast.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.200]   - It feels fast.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   - It feels really fast.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.040]   - It feels fast.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.280]   - I can feel the wind going through my hair, you know, on that.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.680]   But I don't know whether it's the, you know,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   I'm going faster, it's just a windy bit.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.600]   - They're claiming a 35, up to 35% faster GPU.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.640]   So almost a double the increase for the GPU.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.120]   And I, by the way, I was, I've been talking about this
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.720]   for some time because we knew it would probably be based
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.120]   on the A15, that Apple's problem is when the M1 came out,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.680]   it was such a leap forward, you know, five times faster
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   and things, they're not going to be able to do that
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.720]   at every generation.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.160]   So this was going to be the beginning
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.480]   of incremental improvements along the line.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.120]   And the real question is, you know,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.680]   where these improvements are and, you know,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.640]   clearly focusing on the neural engine,
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.240]   it's 40% faster.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.400]   And on the GPU, it's 35% faster is, you know,
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.040]   a smart way to know, I think.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.840]   - And they add the ProRes, the ProRes
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.600]   and the H.264, H.264 compressors right into the chip.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.680]   So that was external before.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.000]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.720]   So that's now on the processor.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.120]   - Yeah, it's on the processor.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   And what's interesting about that is that it's a lot,
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.000]   I don't think that, I think it's a lot faster
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.080]   because it's now in the chip.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.360]   It's no longer part of the board.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   So in the max, the studio max as well as the 16 inch max,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.840]   those chips were discrete and they were on the board.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.000]   By putting them into the central processor,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.600]   you end up with a lot more delivery of the data.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.640]   So it's going to be a lot faster.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.000]   - So on chip is now the high performance media engine,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.640]   the ProRes and code and decode.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.480]   - That's incredible.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.440]   - Support for 6K external displays, that's new.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.600]   - I think one.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.440]   - One.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   - I think display-e.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   - Yeah, we, I think we talked about that,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.640]   we talked about a lot.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.480]   - Really?
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.120]   - So yeah, a lot of people want, yeah,
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   when you look at the laptops,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.360]   you really, you know, a lot of people want to come home
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.640]   and have it be part of their system as opposed to-
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.040]   - So you want to be able to have a 6K monitor that you have.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.160]   - Is it two? - Or two, or two 4Ks?
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.440]   - Yeah. - You know, like, and,
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.040]   and the issue is, is that, is that I think that the,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.120]   what I did find surprising is I know they came out
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.000]   with these lower end ones, and this seems to be the TikTok
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.160]   that they're starting to-
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.760]   - Yeah, these are presumably lower end, yeah.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.720]   - But the issue is, is that for me and a lot of people
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.560]   that I know, as soon as we saw an M2 13 inch Mac Pro,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.880]   no one's buying a 16 inch M1.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.160]   Like, like everyone's like, oh, you know, now it becomes-
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.960]   - It's a really high cliff.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.080]   - Okay. - Because now everyone wants,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.520]   no one wants to buy an M1 now.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   You know, like you want to now wait for the-
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.800]   - 'Cause you're thinking down the road,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.480]   they'll be an M2 Pro. - Yeah.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.160]   - And Macs in a 16 inch.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.440]   - So everyone's gonna try to hang on.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.200]   So it really kills the sales to not have those Macs
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.840]   come out at the same time. - That's tricky, isn't it?
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.760]   - Yeah. - And really, it really
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.600]   kicks the sales.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.160]   I think that obviously by the end of the year,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.480]   they're gonna have to upgrade.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.880]   I don't think they can wait until next year,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.440]   because I think it really will depress sales
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.080]   of the 16 inch, maybe that doesn't matter as much to them,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   but, but for a lot of us, we, you know,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.440]   no one wants to buy an M1 now,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.040]   'cause if you're afraid you're gonna-
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.920]   - Mike and I were talking during the event
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.000]   about maybe they thought that they would slipstream.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.120]   So when they did the M1 announcement with a low end M1s,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.920]   they did iMacs and Mac minis,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.760]   as well as the 13 inch and the MacBook Air.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.960]   Perhaps they will slipstream those extra low ends
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.440]   in the next few months.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.840]   In fact, I already saw a rumor they might do that.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.600]   And M2 Mac mini might be in the offing.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.280]   And then maybe in the fall,
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.480]   what was the cadence last time it was?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.960]   - It seems like they would announce it October, November
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.920]   for the computers because the iPhone gets to own,
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.720]   the only thing the iPhone would potentially share
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.080]   any time with in the fall would be the Apple TV.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.680]   If they had some more Apple TV Plus
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   or some kind of activation that they wanna do.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.480]   And the one thing that could happen is,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.920]   let's say, you know, the iPhone now,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.480]   the Apple TV Plus now does, you know, 4K 120 frames a second,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.080]   which is capable of, but no one,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   but it hasn't been activated yet.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.640]   And they talk about how the phone now can capture 124K
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.200]   and usually view it on the Apple TV.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   That kind of thing might happen.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.640]   But outside of that, they'd really try to keep it.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.320]   It's pretty much about the iPhone.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.200]   - There is a choke point on the supply chain.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.960]   The next iPhone will have the A16,
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   but rumors are only the high ends.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.480]   The pros will have the A16 and the lower ends will stick
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.720]   with the A15, which means a short supply on the A16.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.240]   So they may be pushing up against the limitations
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.360]   of what TMS and C can do, too.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   - I still think Apple could flex.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.040]   I know this sounds crazy, but I think that they could flex
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.240]   a week before the event and just go,
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.520]   "Hey, we're gonna put something out next week.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.960]   "Here are the prices.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.840]   "Choose your poison without knowing what it is."
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.680]   Just to show people that they can sell 20 million phones
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.360]   without even showing us what they are.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.480]   'Cause, you know, especially when you know
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.160]   that it's constrained supply,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.120]   if you know it's constrained supply,
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.560]   there's a lot of us that would just buy it.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.320]   Like, I'm gonna buy that one.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.520]   We can guess what it has.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.560]   I'm gonna buy that one ahead of time.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.480]   And I bet you it'd be 10 to 20 million people.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.880]   And that would be a huge flex by Apple,
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.800]   just to show that we don't even have to tell people
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.880]   what it is in the life.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.720]   - They're just gonna buy it.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   - It's gonna buy it.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   - It sold out.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.400]   It sold out.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.240]   We sold out, I can just imagine Tim Cook walking up and going,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.280]   "We sold out through the end of the year before this event."
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.600]   Like, we even told you what it was, you know?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.920]   - They did tell, "How long before Apple offers
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   "like direct deposit?
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.720]   "You can have your paycheck put directly on your Apple card."
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.120]   - Well, they do have buy now, pay later.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   We'll talk about that in a little bit later.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.960]   (laughs)
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Maybe that's the secret.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.480]   They were a little scant in details about
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.960]   when you can order it.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.920]   They were able to put out the prices.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.480]   And the only difference in pricing is 200 bucks more
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.920]   for the base model MacBook Air,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.000]   11.99 instead of 9.99.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.120]   But everything else, as I believe,
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.000]   is the same price with the M2 in it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.320]   They also, let's not forget,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.520]   they've got a Mac Pro to deliver this year.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.760]   They probably don't want to steal its thunder.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.160]   This is going to be interesting.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.880]   And then there's supply chain.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.160]   And that's a huge unknown.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.760]   So all they said is available next month.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.560]   Available, does that mean for pre-orders?
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.160]   Does that mean you'll be able to pick it up?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   Does that what?
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.520]   - Is that going to, you can order it before July 31st?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.040]   - Yeah, that's all we know.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.880]   (laughs)
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.960]   - Exactly.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.600]   - I mean, obviously there's some factories
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.240]   somewhere making them as fast as they're little feet
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.400]   can scurry, but how many they'll be able to make
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.560]   is really going to be limited by how many chips they can get,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.480]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.880]   And it's the legacy nodes that are even more problematic
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.920]   than the M2s.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.520]   So there's a lot of unknowns.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.360]   And I bet you supply chain king Tim Cook is fretting.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.400]   (laughs)
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.240]   Just a little bit over all this.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.720]   - I will say that the M2, I mean, as a parent,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.120]   the new M2 air is pretty awesome.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.800]   Like pretty awesome computer for your kids.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.120]   Like going to school or whether they're going to college
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.320]   or whatever, it's just an incredibly powerful machine
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.600]   for school work.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.800]   - As last year, the difference in the MacBook Air
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.600]   and the MacBook Pro 13 is you've got more capacity
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.660]   for battery, the battery's life is better.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.000]   Although now that they're not a wedge,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.040]   I don't know if that's the case,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.800]   and you have active cooling, you have a fan
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   in the MacBook Pro.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.920]   And more Thunderbolt, right?
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.280]   Or more connect connectivity.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.680]   - More connectivity, same number of Thunderbolt channels,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.880]   but more ports.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.800]   - Although you do get a mag safe.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.360]   - You get a mag safe on both.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.120]   - But only in the air.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.320]   - Oh, you don't get a mag safe on the third?
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.960]   Oh, they didn't redesign the 13, that's why.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.800]   - Yeah.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.160]   - Yeah, so you only get it in the air,
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.040]   but in the air you get a mag safe back.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   So it looks like the old one.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.520]   - My car wasn't much of a redesign on the air.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.160]   They got rid of the wedge, but that's about it.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.120]   - They essentially made the MacBook Air
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.720]   look like the other MacBooks that are available
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.640]   with the M1 chip.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.760]   So all of them now have that.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.800]   It's those four little, what do they got,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.280]   plateaus on the bottom?
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.760]   Those little four plateau feet
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.640]   that are available on the MacBook Pros.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.080]   It got mag safe and it has the same sort of front style
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.480]   with the notch as well.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.320]   So yeah, they're just bringing it in line
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.160]   with the current design.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.000]   - Everything's so much square off now, yeah.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.840]   - That's excellent.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.080]   - The wedge is starting to look.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.160]   I mean, that's the original design.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.080]   Like Steve Jobs pulled out, pulled that design out
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.040]   of him, no envelope.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.400]   So yeah, Apple is not going to be happy
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.200]   with keeping that same stock design.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.440]   I just, the only thing that I'm,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.080]   we often make fun of like all these YouTube channels
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   that what a horrible, horrible piece of news from Apple
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.840]   that look how easy it is to bend and crack
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   and destroy this iPhone simply by putting
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.000]   like eight tons of pressure on it.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.440]   But nonetheless, that's so thin.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.200]   It was a 12.3, 12.3 millimeters or something.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.280]   That's so thin that even when I put my iPad Pro
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.000]   in my bag, if I've got that bag really stuffed full,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.640]   I get worried about the pressure being put on to the iPad
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.440]   that maybe it will flex a little bit
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.720]   and I'll put a little bend in it.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.320]   I really want to see YouTube, YouTubers and other people
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.800]   actually compare that to the old iPad
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.960]   to the 13 inch MacBook to see if it's weaker
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.520]   and if it's more susceptible to bending or breaking
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.360]   than anything else.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.320]   'Cause that becomes, I love how slim it is.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.520]   It feels as though it's going to be a challenge
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.240]   or two my iPad Pro with the magic keyboard.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.640]   But oh, that's not, I will love it up until the point
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.320]   which it starts to wobble like a potato chip.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.400]   - MagSafe, two Thunderbolt's on the left.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   It's got a high impedance headphone jack on the right.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.320]   Natch and real function keys and fingerprint sensor
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.920]   and then unfortunately, 'cause the 13 inch
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.920]   did not get redesigned, there's still a touch bar
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   on the 13 inch, there's no notch but they have big bezels.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.760]   So really it's as if the notch goes all the way around,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.040]   I guess.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.520]   The notch bothers me a little bit
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.120]   because my menu bar is so full I have to use bar tenor
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   to scooch things out of the way
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.000]   'cause otherwise stuff literally goes under the notch
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.160]   and I don't even know if it's there.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   And I use some programs like EMAX
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   where if I'm full screen, the notch is there.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.600]   Safari and others are smart enough
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.080]   just to go full screen to the notch level.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.480]   But the notch bugs me, I don't like the notch.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.000]   On the other hand, I like it more
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.200]   than I like the touch bar.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.080]   So I think the air is probably the way to go.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.540]   And performance wise, the air should be identical
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.120]   except for sustained throughput, right?
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.360]   - So yeah, so if you're going to do anything
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.960]   that's going to require a lot of CPU over 20 minutes,
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.160]   you're not the air's not the right thing for you.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.000]   So if you're going to-- - You're going to do
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.360]   rendering photogrammetry.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.480]   - Like rendering photogrammetry rendering video.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.760]   You have a long video that needs to be rendered out
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   or compressed.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.560]   You have a 3D rendering, like many of our three,
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.320]   much of our 3D rendering is considerably longer
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.640]   than 20 minutes sometimes one night.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.240]   And so if we're rendering something
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.160]   with ray tracing and glow--
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.320]   - I'll bring that home and do it on my studio.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.080]   - You should, but I mean, again, we've done it a lot
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.720]   in laptops, but without a fan it will be a big deal.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.400]   Like it will and it'll slow to a crawl over time.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.520]   - And I have to correct myself that is not a courage
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.880]   port on the right.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   It is an audio jack.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.120]   (laughing)
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.040]   Not a headphone jack.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.760]   - It is high impedance so it'll drive like really,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.720]   really good headphones.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.800]   - Yeah, pro headphones, yeah.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.280]   Anything else to say about the M2 except Apple's continuing
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.400]   to build upon this Apple Silicon in a very impressive fashion?
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.880]   - What is that? - I'm not surprised
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   that they didn't, but at the same time,
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.320]   I noted that they didn't go ahead and say,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.280]   "Oh, and by the way, we have that secret little thing
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.080]   on the side that lets us connect multiple together."
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.280]   Because remember with the M1, they didn't reveal that
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.240]   until they revealed the Mac studio,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.680]   at which point they said, "We've got this special connector
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.560]   that was always there ready to have two of them
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.920]   laying side by side."
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.800]   They didn't mention that with the M2,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.320]   but I imagine that the same thing is going to play out.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.640]   - What did the office hours folks think about hardware,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.840]   anything we've left out?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.800]   'Cause I'm sure there was a lot of conversation
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.720]   about that, Alex.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.560]   - I mean, there was a fair bit of it.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.280]   I mean, the continuity camera is really popular
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.040]   in office hours. - That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.680]   Yeah, a lot of people really.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.960]   It was the most impressive, 'cause I think across the board
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.560]   and the conversations that we've had,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.160]   everyone's favorite, I mean, when we were watching,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.600]   'cause we were watching a couple hundred of us
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.680]   were watching it together yesterday,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.840]   when Craig did the run, that was the hit.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.080]   Like everyone was laughing and having a great time with it.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.680]   But the thing that got everyone to really just stop
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.080]   and look at what they were doing,
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.640]   was the continuity camera using the ultra wide,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.160]   and then re-deforming a perspective view underneath it
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.520]   into something that looked flat.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.440]   And there was a lot of people that were just like,
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   "Whoa, that's a flex."
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.360]   That's like, look at that, that was something like that.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.040]   - Don't get your hopes up, because there was a hands-on,
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.880]   I can't remember who did it, it was Apple Insider,
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.320]   a nine to five, somebody obviously installed
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.200]   the developer beta immediately.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.360]   And showed us what it looks like, don't get your hopes up.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.760]   (laughs)
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   - It was just an interesting, I mean,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.960]   it's one of those things that--
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.280]   - I too got excited, I thought, wow, that's really cool.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.840]   Well, again, I think that it's gonna take a little while
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.600]   before they release it, so we're probably looking
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.520]   at an early one, two, a lot of us have lots of cameras,
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.080]   and we probably wouldn't want that angle anyway.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.000]   But the fact that they were really--
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.840]   - Was that cool?
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.800]   That's heavy math, that's not like a simple math.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.840]   - Well, Wesley Hilliard's article,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.520]   hands-on at Apple Insider,
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.160]   he's got his iPhone 13 there.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.280]   It does use the wide angle, by the way,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.640]   this is actually a good thing to know,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.480]   and again, this is the developer release,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.200]   so this is early days, but this is center stage,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.600]   he says center stage requires you to use wide angle,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.320]   which means it is a little bit softer, as you can see.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.640]   Portrait studio light, you can stack them.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.880]   Portrait and studio light looks pretty darn good.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.600]   I really like that studio light feature.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   This is the 14 inch MacBook Pro
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.760]   versus the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Studio Display.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.800]   Studio Display, guess which one's the studio display?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   (laughing)
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Holy cow, but unfortunately, this is the desktop shot.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.840]   He says, "Deskmon is a bit awkward,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.320]   depending on when you use it, the camera can only see
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.360]   so far down, so it needs plenty of space in front
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.400]   to actually see a desk in our testing.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.360]   Deskmon focused on our chest at about a three degree angle
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.920]   below the camera at three feet away,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.960]   so unless you have a desk on your chest, it's...
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's when I had a punch.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.800]   - It was a good demo.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   It was a good demo. - I had the California burrito
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.640]   with extra salsa.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.520]   - So, did the camo get Sherlocked?
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   - Doesn't look like it.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.800]   - No?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.920]   - No, I think that camo's got some trouble.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.080]   Like it's gonna be, you know, like, regardless of the...
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.560]   - There'll be a percentage of people who'll say,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.560]   "I've got all I need with that."
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.600]   - Yeah, especially in folks who haven't even heard
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.000]   of camo in the first place,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   that now they've got this feature that is built in
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.800]   and it's a little bit more discoverable
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.640]   and doesn't require cables and things like that.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   So, yeah, the group that they're going after right now,
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.800]   now they've got some trouble there,
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.680]   but if it doesn't work very well in comparison to me
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.160]   being able to have a cable plugged in
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.520]   that does have a very high quality video,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.760]   then I'm sick of what I got.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.360]   - Well, yeah, in fact, it might be good for camo
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.720]   because it'll raise the awareness that you can use an iPhone
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.480]   and they may say, "Oh, maybe I need a better solution
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.960]   in camo." - Yeah, I mean, I think that
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.320]   the vast majority of us within Office Hours
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.360]   is using Filmic with, or Shoot, Shoot of the--
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.400]   - Yeah, I started with Shoot.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.240]   I like Shoot a lot.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.520]   You told me about Shoot, I started with Shoot.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.320]   I don't know why I bought camo.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.800]   I bought both of them and I ended up using camo,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.720]   I can't remember why, but both of them
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   are let you use the camera without any,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.120]   you know, in a clean feed. - Right.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.280]   - And I used it on Sunday, you know, our studio got fried.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.360]   We had a power outage overnight on Saturday night
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.000]   and an analog board got fried, even though it was on a UPS.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.640]   And we couldn't do audio out of the studio.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.800]   So I had to go home, thank God I had camo set up
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.280]   with my iPhone 12 and all of Twit was done on camo
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.120]   with iPhone 12 and it saved the day, to be honest.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.600]   Zoom, by the way, Zoom worked better at home than it does here.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.760]   (laughing)
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.960]   Zoom is amazing, Alex, 'cause I had to do it old school
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.000]   where it was one Zoom call with four people.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.280]   And it worked great.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.520]   - Yeah, it's the big tank.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.880]   - Somebody pointed out, there's less lag,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.480]   there was less lag on that doing it that way than there.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.440]   And I guess that makes sense.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.800]   We're doing, here we do four different,
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.520]   or three different zooms.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.320]   - Yeah, you have twice, you pay twice for it.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.560]   So that's like for the bigger shows I do,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.320]   I still use individual computers for each person
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.560]   like you do in Twit.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.440]   For office hours, we're using what's called Zoom ISO,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.360]   which allows us to basically go into an existing meeting
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.240]   and grab 1080p feeds out of it.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.040]   And so we pull those feeds directly, you know, out of it
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.640]   and pump them into a switcher.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.560]   And that's where, I mean, I think that Twit
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.080]   will eventually want to go.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   There's a lot of development in that area.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.680]   When Zoom bought liminal, all that stuff.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.800]   - I have to hire you for a consult because
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.480]   you don't have to hire me, Leo, you just call me.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   - That was one real big surprise.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.920]   I'll have some, a general question.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.320]   I was a big surprise was that I didn't have any latency.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.160]   There were people that didn't talk over each other on Sunday
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.680]   and it was like, wow.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.480]   This should be worse, not better, but it actually was better.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.920]   It makes sense 'cause one Zoom call
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.200]   so that they can synchronize it a little bit better, I guess.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.360]   But yeah, yeah.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:24.920]   All right, so hardware wise, what are you buying, Alex?
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.360]   - None of the stuff that we released.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.000]   - None of the stuff, you're gonna wait for an M2 Pro Max.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.880]   - I mean, I have, I just bought the studio.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.040]   So I have, I've made it--
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.880]   - It's two to the three things.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   - Fantastic.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.040]   - And I don't have to use laptop.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.880]   - And I don't have to use the studio, Max.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.120]   I don't need the Ultra.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.280]   And I have no interest in small screens.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.880]   Like I bought a 14 inch to make
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.320]   because I was gonna, when I travel, I'm gonna do this thing.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.000]   Well, A, I haven't traveled very much.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.240]   And B, I hate the 14 inch.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.760]   Like I hate that form factor with a passion.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.520]   Like when I open it up, I'm just like,
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.440]   oh my goodness, I can't believe I did this.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   So anyway, so, so like I just,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.960]   every time I open it up, I'm angry.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.440]   I'm like, I can just use my iPad.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.080]   And so, so anyway, so, so I hate that 14 inch
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.320]   and I don't like the form factor.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.360]   I really want, I wanna go back to the 17 inch effect.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.000]   I'd buy an 18 inch laptop.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.440]   But I don't--
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.280]   - And you make a good point that this just
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.320]   telegraphs what they're gonna be doing next
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.680]   with the more high-end stuff.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.040]   Do you think the pro will be an M2?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.440]   I guess it will be.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.320]   - I think it'll be an M2.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.360]   I think you'll end up with a mag safe,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.160]   along with two thunderbolts.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.760]   - No, not the laptop, the Mac Pro, the desktop.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.600]   - Oh, the Mac Pro?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.440]   - Yeah.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.280]   - I think the big thing with the Mac Pro,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.720]   the big question is whether they're gonna make it big enough
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.240]   to put PCI slots in.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.680]   I mean, 'cause I think that that should be there
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.880]   when I'm at the bottom of the field.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.840]   - Yeah, you need in trouble.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.560]   So, a lot of us want to, yeah, want to do that.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.920]   - Andy, did you, somebody in the chat room said,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.480]   "Boy, Leo's lucky that you couldn't buy this right away."
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.000]   (laughing)
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.880]   'Cause I had my finger, but there was no point
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.240]   in hovering it over any buy button.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.480]   Andy, are you tempted?
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.880]   - No, I'm still waiting for whatever.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.560]   I still think that the best Mac in my future
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   is going to be a very nicely loaded Mac Mini with whatever.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.480]   When they really do refresh the Mac Mini,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.640]   they don't make it into a studio.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.720]   They just simply say, "We're gonna take this form factor.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.560]   "We're gonna take this rough price point
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.720]   "and we're just gonna put hotter, solocan in it."
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.120]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.360]   Love the MacBook Air.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.440]   There's so many reasons today,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.040]   and we'll get into some more of that later on today,
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.240]   but there's so many reasons now for wondering
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.080]   why is Apple continuing to make a Mac line
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.280]   and an iPad line?
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   'Cause the MacBook Air really does.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.360]   If that design, if that render had come out
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.640]   like two or three years ago as,
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.280]   "Hey, Apple's coming up with a new iPad
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.920]   "that has an integrated keyboard and trackpad."
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.200]   We would have believed it immediately
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.920]   because that's the right design line
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.160]   which is right the size, it's the right thickness.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.320]   It's gonna be interesting.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.040]   We're gonna be looking for a shakeup in the MacBook line
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.680]   because it's hard to figure out
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.560]   why there's some 13-inch MacBook
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.520]   and a MacBook Air, why not simply have
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.640]   the two larger sized ones and give the people
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.080]   who are coming in with 12, 13, $1,400
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.800]   to spend on a laptop, some clarity.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.000]   The only, the last thing I'll say is that
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.720]   I'm glad that Apple still has a 999 MacBook
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.840]   on the price list.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.320]   I'm disappointed that it's,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.400]   well, we're just gonna take like the last year's model
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.640]   and just keep it on the price list.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.200]   I think that Apple really needs to maintain commitment
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.080]   to having at least one MacBook under $1,000.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.440]   And I think they should be aiming for 899
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.680]   for the minimum buy-in to buy a portable Mac.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.480]   So it's, I'm looking forward to them
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.440]   basically looking at the $900 price point,
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.800]   the $1,000 even price point and saying,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.240]   "No, we're not gonna just give you the old Mac.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.160]   "We're gonna give you something brilliant and wonderful
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   "that is designed so that we can actually sell it to you
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.360]   "and make a profit for that."
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.080]   But we acknowledge that a lot of people
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.600]   have a hard ceiling of $1,000 to spend on a MacBook.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.080]   - I do like 24 gigs of RAM over 16.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.620]   I think that's kind of nice.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.960]   What do you think, Micah?
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.360]   Does any of this tempt you?
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.600]   - So I have an Intel MacBook Pro, a 16 inch.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.480]   - Oh, well, you need a good one for sure.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.600]   - So, well, there's the thing,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.360]   it is my portable device, right?
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.280]   And increasingly, I am realizing
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.640]   that I would benefit from a smaller device
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.800]   that could be my portable device.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   The laptop that I use for the tech guy
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.680]   when I come in on Saturdays with you.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.440]   And I've got that little desk to sit it on,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.400]   my own lunch tray.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   And so I've got this Mac studio that is blazing fast.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.520]   It's amazing that I'm using right now
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.040]   that I use for my shows and it is great.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.560]   But as a secondary device,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.480]   I think now that it would be my true secondary device,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.800]   I don't know if I wanna wait for the 14 inch MacBook Pro
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   that's, you know, will come out with the M2 chip
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.480]   or, you know, dig in right now with the 13 inch MacBook Pro
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.560]   or even the MacBook Air,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.120]   because for my purposes as a secondary device,
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   any of those is--
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.800]   - Any M1.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.640]   - Step up, yeah.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.560]   - Yeah, it's gonna be better.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.480]   Yeah, that's always true.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.920]   The people who are really, you know,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.960]   have old machines, anything that you step up to.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.960]   I bought a M1 Mac Mini instead of a studio for the studio,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.360]   my radio studio, and it's been great.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.400]   And it's indistinct, it's indistinguishable.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.000]   In day to day operation from any other M1,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.480]   and I'm not sure the M2 will be noticeably different
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.080]   from any other M1.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.400]   - I think it depends on what you do with it.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   - Yeah, you know what I'm saying,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.880]   but I'm talking about day to day, you know, email,
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.120]   web browsing, stuff most people do, not photogrammetry.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.720]   - No, I have seven of them.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.960]   So, I have five, six of those are,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.040]   I own, I mean, six of them,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.320]   I bought myself not the company,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.200]   like I own, well, I have them for office hours.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.880]   And they are, most of them are eight gigs,
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   'cause I just needed them quickly
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.120]   and are all one equivalent, didn't think,
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   and they've been fine.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.280]   And then the one, the one 16 is here
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.720]   that I use for a variety of things.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.000]   And it's, I can hit the ceiling on it.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.760]   Like it's not like DaVinci Resolve will hit the ceiling,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.880]   you know, on it.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.720]   - What does that mean?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.480]   It slows down or?
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.760]   - It starts to crawl, it starts to have some anomalies.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.360]   It's just, it's just, it's just way--
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.560]   - It's unreliable, that's not--
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.400]   - Well, it's six, it's, to be fair,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.800]   it was six channels or six video streams
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.560]   of 5.7K Blackmagic RAW.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.640]   - Well, of course it crawls.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.520]   Okay, see your day-to-day operation is a little different
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.440]   when I move that, when I move that to the studio,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   it just runs like butter.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.480]   Like it just goes, hello, you know, like,
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.400]   I can, I can now do it.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.600]   So, but, so I know where the, I know where the,
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   but for almost everything I do on a day-to-day basis,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   90% of it, the Mac mini is just rock, you know,
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.560]   and I love that.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.480]   - I have to say the new Air has some compelling features,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.040]   even if you had the M1 Air, a 1080p camera,
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.720]   although we haven't yet seen, you know,
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.440]   there's Mac Studio also has a,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.360]   display also as a 1080p camera.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.200]   That by itself doesn't tell you anything.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.480]   0.44 inch height, which is interesting
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.760]   'cause the MacBook Air with that wedge starts at 6.16
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.640]   and goes to 0.63, I guess I should do it in metric,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.560]   but I'm sorry, this is America.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.440]   And wait, you know, I thought 2.7 pounds, that sounds heavy,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.200]   but it is still lighter than the M1 MacBook Air
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.920]   by a tenth of a pound.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.320]   So, there are reasons you might wanna look at a new Air,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.200]   and I have to say, I feel like by not redesigning
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.320]   the MacBook Pro 13-inch, Apple might have made
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.560]   a little bit of a mistake.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   - Yeah.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.640]   I'm a little disappointed too that one of the best,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.400]   one of my favorite rumors about the MacBook Air
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.920]   was that they are gonna offer it in the same,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.640]   like really wonderful range of colors
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.600]   as they created the iMacs.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.440]   - Yeah, do it.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.600]   - It's like, okay, it's, I mean, it's not bad,
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.800]   but I understand that they can't have,
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.120]   so they can't have a whole bunch of lime green.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.680]   They can't find out by empirical failure
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.720]   that no one wants the lime green air,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.560]   and the lime green air is the only one
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.400]   that you can actually pick up at the store today.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.800]   The rest of them have like a three month wait.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.640]   - Frankly, this is the--
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.120]   - The supply chain issues, I'm surprised
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.560]   they even did four skus.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.400]   - True.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.240]   - Right?
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.000]   You know, this is, you don't wanna make more than you have to.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.360]   I guess there's no supply chain issue in color aluminum.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.200]   (laughing)
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.000]   - The very thing about having three,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.160]   you have two shades of gray, that means that
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.560]   you're not gonna think twice about putting
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.480]   really cool stickers on it.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.720]   - Oh, the third thing on the MacBook Air
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.400]   is that 24 gigs of RAM.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.120]   The M2, I think that's a significant difference.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.800]   - I just think it's available on black.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.920]   - Oh, you just still want black.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.680]   Is an anodized aluminum and black card to do?
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.480]   - Isn't it black?
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.400]   Didn't it have a black?
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.680]   - There's no black.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.120]   It's gray, silver, midnight, so it's dark.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.960]   - It's not that dark.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   - It's fine, it's okay.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.800]   - Oh, okay.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.200]   - Mid black black would be great.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.560]   - I like it, I like it.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.200]   - I gotta look at how dark midnight is.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.920]   - For your military ops,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.800]   of which you have plenty, you have a long list of clients.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.280]   - Let's see, let's look at this.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.120]   - Yeah, this is you guys streaming.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.360]   - Yeah, it is black.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.200]   That is black.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.040]   - It's pretty dark.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:14.880]   - It's pretty dark.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.720]   - Oh, that's not, oh, you know what?
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.160]   I would buy, you know what?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.880]   You just, you convinced me, I just thought it was
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.320]   the metallic gray, the slate gray, but no, no,
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.160]   that's pretty dark.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   It's pretty, it's midnight.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.640]   I think Starlight is how it goes.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.240]   - It's kind of a blue-hued black.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.080]   - Is it?
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.840]   - I mean, this is black.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.280]   - Yeah, you paid a hundred bucks extra for that.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.320]   This looks pretty good.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   I did not fully appreciate it.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.000]   This is the midnight.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.960]   - There's the space gray, there's the silver,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.520]   and there's the Starlight.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.240]   - I'm gonna go black.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.840]   - I think Apple, Apple, you know, they made a gold watch.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.960]   They should make a quote unquote,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.240]   but instead of gold for the laptop,
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.520]   they should make it Vanta Black.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.280]   - I'm just like, 'cause the logo,
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.320]   it just looked like it was like,
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.640]   it would look like there's a black hole in front of you
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.440]   with a logo just floating in front of it.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.120]   - Stealth, I wanna stealth.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.440]   - Yeah, stealth.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.960]   - That would be the best exercise for Mr. Beast.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   - Yeah, I'm exactly Vanta Black.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.200]   The black is black.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   - Just don't touch it or pick it up or move it.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.640]   - It's spinal tap black.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.920]   - Yeah, yeah, there's that.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   - The black is too black.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.920]   - It's so practical.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.000]   - Super practical.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.840]   - Okay.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.360]   I wouldn't, you know, okay,
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.760]   now I'm a little more interested.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.840]   And the, I didn't realize it was that dark in midnight.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.520]   - Yeah, I'm hoping that we see more of those choices.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.360]   I don't think they,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.440]   I don't really need green or purple,
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.000]   I just think that's black as it can be.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.480]   - Let me see if I got that and I maxed everything out.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.040]   So I got 24 gigs of RAM,
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.200]   I got two terabytes of storage,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.120]   I got the six to seven watt USB,
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.960]   oh no, oh they have now this dual port adapter,
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.520]   which was kind of hysterical.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.920]   - If you max it out,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.960]   you get the really good 65 watt adapter.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.040]   Otherwise you get the 35 watt no extra ports, I think.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.920]   - No, there's a, now remember that we thought,
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.960]   Mike and I were kind of stunned by this.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.480]   This we thought was gonna be a third party,
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.960]   but Apple's offering you.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.400]   It's only 35 watts though.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.240]   - Oh okay.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.480]   - But you get the 65,
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.320]   if you get the 67. - You get the 67.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.880]   - You could choose, no, you could choose either,
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.520]   well maybe because I'm higher spec,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.200]   either one you get to choose.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.280]   I'll go, yeah gosh, that's a good,
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.520]   I believe, I don't, I believe that it's a high watt
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.400]   it's for adapters, I don't need that.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.680]   Maybe I'll get the dual one just for fun.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.400]   - I actually have to say that I don't find the Apple
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.280]   power supplies.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.120]   - No.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.020]   - You can't get the
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.860]   - I get plenty of gain adapters from all the
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.120]   - That's right. - the
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:43.960]   - I really like them.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.800]   - Yeah.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.240]   - So 2500 bucks maxed out.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.080]   - Wow.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.400]   - For MacBook Air, I know that's not an unreasonable amount
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.920]   of money for a machine of that performance and that design,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.480]   but I will always think of the MacBook Air as the wildest
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.480]   amount of money you spend on it is $1,500.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.800]   Above that, you're in MacBook Pro territory.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.640]   - Yeah.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.720]   Well the one thing is, it's important for the marketing teams
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.160]   to do a lot of big companies because the marketing teams
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.080]   can't often get pros.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.920]   So they can't get them.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.360]   - Because they're marketing.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.200]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.040]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.040]   - They can only get the errors.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:17.880]   - Yeah.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.400]   - So you can't buy the pros unless you're an engineer
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.200]   or you can't request them.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.360]   So a loaded air might be a
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.800]   - MacBook and all stuff for marketing.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.240]   - Especially, your rock, mid, mid, black.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.000]   - The rock, your overseas are historically funny.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.920]   - Yeah, they are funny.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.320]   They create a lot of odd flows.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.120]   Let's take a little break 'cause I really want to talk
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.720]   about iPadOS.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.560]   - Yeah.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   - And Apple has now made clear after a lot of speculation
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.360]   on our part what the intent was with the iPad.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.080]   And it's clear now, I think, at least it is in my mind.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.480]   I'll see if it is in yours,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.080]   what they intend to do with the iPad.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.320]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.200]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.320]   We have, I don't know how many, three.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.520]   We have a number of employees we hired with Zip Recruiter.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.720]   It's been really great for us.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.840]   We love Zip Recruiter.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.160]   And here it is summertime,
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.840]   and man, the job market is red hot, right?
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.480]   There, where do you find people?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.200]   If you're a business owner, the last thing you want to do
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.280]   is spend your free time sorting through unqualified
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.920]   candidates when you could be spending time on vacation
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.560]   at the pool or at a backyard barbecue
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.400]   or gardening or something.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.880]   That's why you need Zip Recruiter to find good candidates.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.360]   They do the work for you.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.960]   And now you can try it free at ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.840]   Did I say good?
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.400]   Great candidates.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.360]   We love the people we've hired through Zip Recruiter.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.920]   There are a lot of reasons to use Zip Recruiter.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   You can't ask the widest possible in that.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.320]   They're posting to 100 plus job boards.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   Plus, all of those resumes, all of those emails,
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.160]   don't go into your inbox.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.240]   They go to the Zip Recruiter interface
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.200]   where it's easy to eliminate unqualified candidates.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.080]   You have questions.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.760]   You can ask them things like that, screening questions.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.960]   They reformat all the resumes
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.600]   so the raises is scanned through.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.000]   It makes it very simple to rank and rate people
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.080]   so that you can find the right people fast.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.000]   And there's one more things that Percruiter does
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.160]   that is fantastic.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.880]   They find the right candidates for your job.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.720]   They offer you.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.520]   They go through all the resumes they have on fall.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.360]   They take all those resumes, they scan through them
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.040]   and they find ones that meet your qualifications.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.960]   They send them to you so you can invite them.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.800]   And I gotta tell you, when you invite somebody
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.040]   to apply to your job, their ears perk up,
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.000]   their eyes light up.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.320]   They go, "Wow, you want me?"
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.800]   It's a great way to start a great relationship.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.400]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.760]   get a quality candidate within the first day.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.440]   For us, it's usually within the first hour.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.640]   It's amazing.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.440]   The number one rated hiring site
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.600]   based on G2 satisfaction ratings
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.120]   as of January 1st of this year, Zip Recruiter.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.040]   That's a lot of satisfaction, baby.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.440]   This summer led Zip Recruiter to do the work.

[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.520]   Mac, break weekly and my very expensive Macintosh habit.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.720]   I think you know what, I'm happy with the Mac Studio,
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.200]   but I feel like we probably should get,
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.560]   right, Micah, we need to get an M2,
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.920]   just to talk about it, just to review it, right?
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.800]   Of course, Leo.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.240]   Of course you need to get an M2.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.640]   I think honestly, since you're still using a 16 inch
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.760]   Intel device, maybe you should get,
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.680]   which one would you, if, then remember,
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.600]   we're gonna get it for you as your employer.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.800]   Which one would you get?
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.400]   Would you get the Touch Bar one with the bigger fan?
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.000]   Or would you, I think I should get an error, don't you think?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.840]   Yeah, because again, this I just wanted to be
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.440]   this secondary portable device.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.800]   It could be faster, much faster than the 16 Intel.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.640]   Yup.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.480]   All right.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.320]   Midnight MacBook Air.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.000]   Would you get it midnight for me so I could see it?
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.680]   Okay. For you.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.440]   I know you like, I like, you probably like what?
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.120]   What do you want, Starlight?
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.400]   The plain silver.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.800]   The silver boring.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.280]   You can get silver if you want.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.880]   I'll just have to watch Alex's from a distance.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.680]   Unless Alex, you find somebody that can make it Vanta Black.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.720]   I know, I'm, I'm.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.400]   I bet you, that's the way you know.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.480]   I bet you something.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.320]   Right?
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.160]   I don't know.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.000]   I mean, it'd be a horrible waste of money
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.520]   because it would scratch off in like 10 seconds.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.240]   Oh, it's just a paint job?
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.320]   It's a paint, I mean, I think it'd be very hard
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360]   to get Vanta Black, because it's the nature of the surface.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.480]   You couldn't, it would be very...
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.960]   No, you want to analyze, yeah, you'd add.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.560]   Well, you'd want to protect it
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.760]   with some of that polyurethane spray at Home Depot.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.600]   Oh, there you go.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   That's a big and shiny.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.480]   And then it would be shiny, but very,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.480]   it'd be weird, weird highlights of stuff appearing over black.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.840]   If you're looking for a practical solution to anything,
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.160]   you wouldn't be suggesting Vanta Black.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.080]   You just want the flex of saying that, yes,
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.480]   I got the stupidest, most expensive paint job
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.240]   on a MacBook ever.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.560]   So Apple did announce new iOS features.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.640]   They're going to be far too much for us to talk about.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.080]   They took them an hour, 48 minutes.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.960]   There's no way we could do it in two hours,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.080]   especially since we should just spend an hour talking about them.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.000]   And one.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.160]   But so we'll get to as much as we can,
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.040]   but I really think the iPadOS is very interesting.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.560]   We had heard rumors that were going to improve
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.400]   the multitasking, but it's a little different
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.880]   what they're doing.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.400]   Andy, what does this tell you anything
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.280]   about Apple's strategy with the iPad?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.120]   You know, the rumors about the,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.400]   we heard about stage manager,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.360]   were that, hey, if you've got a keyboard
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.600]   and a trackpad attached to your iPad Pro,
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.320]   you will be able to have overlapping windows
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.560]   for the first time, which sounded like a very,
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.120]   very simple solution to a productivity problem.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.560]   Instead, they gave us a stage manager
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.000]   that is now the combined,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.120]   WorkSpace Manager application switcher
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.960]   across the Mac and the iPad.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.960]   So once again, we're getting a completely unified experience
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.600]   across both.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:20.400]   And I haven't installed the developer beta on my iPad
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.120]   'cause I use my iPad every day.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.240]   I only have one that will.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.080]   I've got it.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.040]   Did you, you installed it?
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.040]   Look, he's got it.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.880]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.720]   Oh, oh.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.720]   All right, so there are two screens.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.240]   So a couple of questions now that you,
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.400]   oh, thank you for doing this, Micah.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.000]   Can you hide the stage?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.400]   Yes, I just, so this is what's interesting about it
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.840]   is you actually have to use control center
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.880]   to turn it on and off.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.600]   So if you want it on, you go down and you find
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.920]   a control center stage manager to turn that off
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   and then you'll see it goes into split view here.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.760]   I'll swipe down again.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.040]   I'll turn the control center back on.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.320]   See, this is the big change from me,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.800]   my point of view is from tiled windows
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.640]   to overlapping windows.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.000]   But can you drag that overlapping window?
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.400]   Yes, you can.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.520]   Can you click the Safari to bring it to the front?
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.360]   Yep.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.200]   Oh.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.560]   So it's a windowed operating system all of a sudden.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.080]   To me, that's a massive shift.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.520]   That's a desktop.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.400]   That's a desktop shift.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.000]   Absolutely.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.160]   And also the fact that you can have that pin to--
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.480]   Micah has a pin to the left, but you
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.640]   also have a pin to the bottom, I think, of the screen.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.040]   So it's just--
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   Can I get it to the right?
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.320]   Because I like to--
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.480]   That's why I want it to.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.120]   And you can.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.200]   Maybe you can on the Mac.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   This is the iPad.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   But the idea that you can drag windows in and out
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.120]   of that shelf and group and ungroup.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.000]   And essentially try to have the same sort of mojo
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.640]   you got going on with the iPad that I like,
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.760]   which is focus on one app at a time very, very easily,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.280]   but also easily switch between a different workspace
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   or a different set of tools grouped together.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.440]   That's really interesting and really powerful,
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.560]   even on the Mac.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:53.120]   But as you say, it is a huge shift
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.480]   from what the iPad was designed to do originally.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.800]   I actually thought that Apple's idea of having a tablet OS,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.200]   a touch OS, and how it would manage windows and apps
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.480]   simultaneously compared to windows
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.520]   was a little bit-- was a lot more forward-thinking.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.800]   Instead of just simply having, oh, we'll do this the same way
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.560]   we've done since the mid-1980s.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.440]   The idea of saying, no, we will-- we're not
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.560]   going to let you have four windows open everywhere
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.200]   and overlapping and however you want.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.280]   But we will make it so easy to place them
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.640]   and to make them into a very, very productive workspace,
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.320]   meaning that we're not imagining that you're
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.280]   going to be using an iPad for something that we'd
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.720]   be better suited for a notebook.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.320]   We imagine that what you want to do
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:43.320]   is have a column of notes and an outliner
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.000]   that you're making notes from, but you also
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.960]   have a PDF document in the main tile or a worksheet
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.000]   or a web page that you're making notes from.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.400]   That's what I really, really like about being productive
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.240]   with the iPad.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.920]   So I'm really, really keen to see, as soon as the public beta
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.520]   comes out, how natural it is to actually use this.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.640]   I'm sure it's going to help that I'll probably
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.840]   be using this on an external display.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.040]   Which is another feature that they've actually--
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.120]   I mean, I've got-- I mean, I was fiercely making notes.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:13.560]   Go ahead.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.120]   Let me ask, Micah, can you--
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.320]   so there's limited to two different windows.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:18.840]   Is that right?
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.640]   Ooh, let me see if I can pull up a third.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.760]   Up to four windows with no overlap that I've at least
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.160]   without overlapping.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.000]   So I talked about this yesterday.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.720]   In the early days of computing, there was a debate over--
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.560]   go ahead, show my screen, because that's all I really care
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.720]   about, not me.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.560]   Oh, yeah, I haven't gotten there yet.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   OK.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   So there was a debate in the earliest days of windowing,
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.960]   I mean, like Xerox Park days, whether you
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.680]   should have tiled windows, which is a lot easier
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.400]   for the computer, or overlapping windows.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.600]   And overlapping windows kind of won
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:56.680]   with the original Macintosh and with windows on PCs.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.160]   But as soon as we went to the iPad, suddenly it was--
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.680]   first it was full screen, period, or nothing.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.720]   And then with multitasking, they got tiled windows.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:10.320]   This is a big leap into a different world of computing.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.000]   And really what it tells me is that Apple has a fork
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.560]   on the road, that Apple is now saying,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.200]   we have essentially two desktop operating systems,
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.680]   one for people with a touch, and one for people with a mouse,
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.840]   one for people who want to get a lot of powerful work done.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.800]   Because they added to the file manager,
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.080]   they added to files, a lot of kind of--
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.000]   you can rename--
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.720]   You can change extensions.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.520]   That's a desktop concept that was alien to the iPad
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.760]   until very, very recently.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.600]   Well, fundamentally, I mean--
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   Go ahead.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.160]   I think any question of these operating systems
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.200]   aren't fully finding each way.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.280]   They're finding their way together.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.200]   Like, I mean, the iOS and iPad--
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.120]   But there'll still be a distinction, right?
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:53.880]   Because one's touch.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   I don't think you're ever going to put touch on the Mac, right?
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.040]   Yeah, but I think that the development of those--
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.520]   I think that you could end up with two different interfaces.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.280]   Like, we think about that when we think about dynamic interfaces,
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.120]   where you have an interface that's touch, an interface that
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.640]   is more mouse-driven.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.920]   And like you would have when we build web pages,
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.080]   we have one for mobile, one for desktop.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.120]   It displays itself differently depending on what it's on.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.760]   So a kind of a responsive interface for the same app,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.560]   I think, could be something that we could see in the future.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.360]   Well, one of the things I was thinking about was that--
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.520]   so you mentioned that it also is--
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.320]   that the iPadOS is going to also be supporting external
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.560]   displays for the first time, meaning not just simply
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.120]   mirroring your iPad display to a larger display,
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.320]   but actually having a second display the way
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.480]   that we expected to work on the iPad.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.360]   And I imagined immediately what would happen
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.000]   with universal control.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.600]   So if I have two monitors--
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.920]   the identical-- my two identical Del favorite monitors
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.520]   on a two-arm pivoting stand, and I'm using universal control,
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.120]   and assuming that universal control will
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.520]   work on an iPad external display,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   given that they're both using--
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.920]   they're both the Mac and the iPad are going
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.280]   to be using stage manager.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.920]   Both the Mac and the iPad are--
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.320]   the third-party apps are probably
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.040]   going to be trying to support Apple's new concept of toolbars.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.120]   It's going to be a very, very shared experience.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.240]   It's going to be very, very difficult to tell the difference
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.960]   between what I'm going to be--
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.920]   what I'm doing on the Mac versus what I'm doing on the iPad.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.000]   And that is a signal change between what Apple's
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.880]   been doing with the iPad.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.560]   I think Apple's--
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]   Sorry, launch the Mac.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.920]   --the messaging and advertising will all point you--
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.320]   remember, what's a computer, right?
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.920]   The point you-- the younger generation that's
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.080]   used to iOS and touch will be now, I think,
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.760]   just as productive on an iPad as they would be on a desktop.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.240]   They'll prefer iPad if you want mobility,
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   if you want to work in your lap.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.320]   There'll be a lot of reasons why people will say, oh, no.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.120]   I don't think there's going to be any confusion.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.680]   I think old school people will want a Mac.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.840]   And I think a younger generation, I think your kids, Alex,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.400]   will want an iPad.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.360]   Yeah, my kids are--
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.160]   I mean, they've had iPads almost their entire life.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.120]   So they are very facile with the iPads.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.520]   And so I think that they will continue down that path.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.800]   I think that the thing that I have trouble with
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.080]   is there's just things that are difficult to do with touch.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.960]   I think omnigraphful is a good example of something
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.840]   that I build wiring diagrams and omnigraphful--
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.040]   Yeah, you're going to get a desktop.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.840]   --that I cannot do on the iPad.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.640]   But I couldn't--
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.320]   there's nobody, young or old, that could build a wiring
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.600]   diagram as fast as I build them in the desktop version
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.120]   on the iPad.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.760]   Not because it's that you're comfortable with one or the other.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.520]   It's that the touch interface just isn't--
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.080]   A mouse is better for that.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.400]   --for that one thing.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.920]   So there's a handful of things that
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.160]   are going to be like that that require a precision
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.760]   that you can't get with your finger.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.920]   And I think that that's where we're still
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.440]   going to be problematic.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.800]   Maybe with a pencil.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.480]   Maybe you can get--
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.400]   I think for the time, I would love to draw it out.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.360]   --photographers, artists will gravitate towards touch.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.200]   I think that for word processing, is this is good?
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.960]   Probably not.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.280]   Well--
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.640]   I think you know iPad, you could word process.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   OK.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   I guess with the real keyboard and all that.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.280]   But also, there are things that are a lot more subtle
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.560]   about that, like being able to do virtual memory swap
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.280]   in the new iPad OS so that you'll have--
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.880]   as you're-- since you're now having 3, 4, 5, whatever,
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.720]   however many apps open at the same time,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.480]   being able for each one to have 16 gigs of application
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.800]   RAM dedicated to it, that's not just, I think,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.360]   for multitasking, that also really
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.720]   enables a higher class of app.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.440]   I've been spending the past day trying to figure out exactly
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.200]   what driver kit entails for iPad OS.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   Because one of the first things I thought about is, oh,
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.400]   so if Apple doesn't want to support an external camera
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.280]   for the iPad, can Logitech simply write an iPad driver
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.640]   for their Brio camera?
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.400]   And now, suddenly, I can have an external camera for it.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.240]   And I won't go through the whole list of things
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.960]   that I've been basically something about this.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.040]   But down, down, down, down, down, just so many things
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.320]   that are trying to make things--
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.080]   they're trying to give it parity with a desktop.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.960]   Even-- I'm really excited as a practical measure
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.320]   all the enhancements they're making to the Files app.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.720]   And I'm slapping myself because I'm getting giddy about, oh,
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.400]   my god, I can actually do a get info on a folder
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.640]   and find out how much you--
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.080]   you mean I can sort on a column?
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.240]   I can sort by size.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   I can sort by file type, just like I've
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.080]   been able to do on every single computer, literally,
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.280]   since Mac OS 1.04.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.480]   I mean, for the longest time we've said,
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.160]   we've looked at the M1 and Mac iPad Pro, particularly,
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.600]   and said that hardware is amazing.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.320]   But the software doesn't live up to it.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.440]   This is a seminal change.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.880]   I think this really--
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.600]   Michael, let me ask you.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.960]   So you've been playing with it.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.680]   How long have you had it?
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.520]   Probably not that long.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.720]   Only since this morning.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.800]   So I'm sure there are a lot of questions.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.200]   So you were able to open multiple windows, yeah?
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:57.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.160]   Let me show here that's the wrong one.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.720]   Nope, that's not it either.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.360]   Where's iPad?
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.320]   He's using Ecamm.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:04.840]   There we go.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.480]   Oh, look at that.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.280]   Lots of windows.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:06.760]   That's for work.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.120]   So I've got four windows open.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.120]   And the weather, by the way.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.080]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.440]   I didn't realize that while--
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.240]   so we know we can tap on another one
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.200]   to bring that forward, right?
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.080]   But while I have weather focused,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.360]   I can still tap and scroll on that--
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.640]   --before even though it's behind.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.240]   That's huge.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.000]   So you can tap to bring it forward,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.720]   but you can still interact with it
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.600]   even though it's in the background.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.360]   That's a very advanced Linux-y kind of a feature.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.320]   That's huge.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.560]   This is, I think--
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.240]   the only thing holding it back really
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.640]   is the size of the screen.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.480]   And the touch interface means the touch targets
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.520]   have to stay pretty big.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.120]   So that whole stage on the left there, that's big.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.320]   That takes up a lot of space.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.440]   I'm not crazy about that.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.520]   Can you auto-hide that?
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.640]   Maybe on the Mac you'll be able to.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.800]   Yeah, I haven't seen the settings for this feature
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.360]   in particular, so I'm not searching.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   The other thing that's--
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.280]   Absolutely huge.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.480]   And they're talking about this in the Swift tracks, I'm sure.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.400]   You'd develop for one platform you're developing for all three,
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.840]   iOS, iPad, OS, and Mac OS.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.680]   Although, interestingly, I understand
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:14.120]   that they're still using catalysts for some of their apps.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.200]   Instead of doing a cross-platform Swift UI app,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.360]   they're using catalyst for a couple of the new apps.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.680]   But--
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.360]   I think that indicates--
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:25.880]   Doesn't matter.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.960]   Right.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.440]   Exactly.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.560]   I think it indicates a lot of faith that they have
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.000]   and how good that tool is.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.840]   They're willing to eat their own dog food.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.400]   Only they don't call it dog food.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.240]   They're feeding it to consumers as well.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.120]   I think it's going to become more and more clear over time
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   that there are people who are going to use the iPad
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.760]   and then people who are going to use the Mac.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.680]   And then there are a lot of us who will use both, right?
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.240]   And if when you're going on the Graffle,
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.440]   you're just going to say, well, let me get my Mac fired up here.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.800]   And to be clear, I would prefer to use the iPad for everything
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.720]   that I could.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.760]   So I try to use the iPad whenever I can.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.840]   In fact, I experiment with stuff even if I had--
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.120]   You try to use it on the Mac.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   And again, I think I've talked about this before.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.880]   I have a very hybrid-- this is a good example--
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.640]   how I develop presentations.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.600]   You know, it's-- and that can be on their iPad or the computer
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.960]   or even my phone.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.640]   I then sketch every slide for keynote.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.200]   In keynote, like I just-- I'm in the iPad drawing.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.240]   Like, this is what I want this slide to look like.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:23.960]   And I go through that.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   But then I go back to the Mac to build it.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.720]   Because the iPad, the touch process--
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.160]   Well, continuity makes that--
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:31.800]   --presentation.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   Very easy, doesn't it?
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.920]   I have to admit, I've been a little modal in how I do it.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.880]   But I think the continuity would make it a lot easier.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.760]   What does make it easier is that I'm saving the iCloud.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.000]   So I just finished what I'm doing on my iPad.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.960]   I open it up in my Mac.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.440]   And I go back--
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.280]   That was another huge feature in Monterey that they showed,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.720]   which is if you're using pages, keynote, a number of apps,
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.480]   you can collaborate.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.360]   But you know, you'd be collaborating with yourself.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.040]   It doesn't have to be a second person.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:00.880]   But you can have--
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.440]   I do that a lot.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.320]   --the same document open up in two different places
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   and changes reflected in both places.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.240]   And they have an API for that.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.440]   I think that benefits the single person as much as it does a team.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.200]   Very, very interesting.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.960]   Tomorrow, thanks to Kovar in our Discord,
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.440]   tomorrow is use Xcode to develop a multi-platform app.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.600]   That's the track for tomorrow.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.800]   Learn how you could build apps for multiple Apple platforms
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.640]   using Xcode 14.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.840]   We'll show you how to streamline app targets, maintain
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.160]   a common code base, and share settings by default.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.000]   We'll also explore how you can customize your app
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.720]   for each platform through conditionalizing your settings
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.520]   and code so you can make it be native depending on the platform.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.960]   Joe says, I'm hoping they don't attempt to turn iPadOS
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.440]   into a pseudo-Mac OS.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.400]   And I think that was one of the fears I had, right?
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.120]   Was that they would either--
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.360]   I was actually maybe a little more afraid they were going to iPadify
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.800]   the Mac.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.440]   But you could also say, I hope they don't
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.840]   macify the iPad.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.920]   But this is not that.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.120]   I think they're going to have two very separate feelings.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.480]   I don't know if it's going to be very separate.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.960]   But I think it is taking what the Mac does and rethinking it.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.440]   So the iPad is a little bit more of a clean slate.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.560]   The Mac has a lot of technical debt.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.840]   And so the thing is that the iPad can be something you can go,
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.000]   hey, this is really necessary on the Mac.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.160]   This would be great on the iPad.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.640]   It won't add it.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.160]   But they are leaving lots of things behind
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.560]   because those things are, again, part of the history,
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.760]   not part of the future.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.400]   Think about how the other redoing settings in Mac OS
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.960]   for the first time and probably since Mac OS 10
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.600]   to make it look a lot either eight, depending on your sense
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.480]   of history, to make it look and work
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.040]   the way that it does on the iPad or the way
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.320]   that it does in Mac OS 6.02.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.160]   Having a scrolling list of different panes and panels.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.720]   And then that's how you get to each individual setting panel.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.040]   As opposed to here are some icons that honestly,
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.560]   I only navigate them by doing a spotlight search for the feature
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.120]   or the thing that I want to adjust
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.480]   because it's hard to navigate visually all these icons.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.800]   Much easier simply to have an alphabetical list.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.640]   I really do think that they want to have as much of a,
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.000]   if the Macs and the iPads don't necessarily
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.200]   cover the same ground, they want it to,
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.400]   the Apple at least wants to have as much
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.280]   of a shared experience as they possibly can.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.720]   And maybe that answers back to my complaint about,
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.800]   ooh, I really want Apple to always have
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.600]   like a really good $900 or $1,000 Mac.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.840]   Maybe their statement is that, well,
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.520]   what used to be the MacBook Air is now like the $799 M1 iPad.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.720]   Oh, there we go.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.160]   I was going to show you, this is the best I can do with what I've got.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.000]   But that's the new settings screen in Mac OS.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   So the icons are off to the side.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.040]   It looks different.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.160]   They also redesigned font book and did it up in Swift UI,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.600]   which I'm a little disappointed because I love my font book
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.800]   and I didn't know anything with that.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.160]   The font book is as plain an app as you could get.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.560]   It's just a list of fonts and what they look like.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.880]   What can they do to make it bad?
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.760]   They just, it's because of it so simple,
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.600]   they could rebuild it using Swift and Swift UI.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   So they kind of went with that.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.880]   But yeah, this see, this, which by the way,
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.040]   incredibly hot 16 inch Intel.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.080]   I can, you have my permission and encouragement
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.720]   to make those orders go up to order any color you want, MacBook Air.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.600]   I felt comfortable installing the beta on here.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.280]   That'll be your beta machine.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.520]   Yeah, that'll be your beta machine.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:39.840]   I just, I feel like there were a couple of moments
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.040]   in this yesterday where Apple announced and probably
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.160]   to little applause some life changing things.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.160]   This iPad OS is one of them.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.000]   The other one is Passkey.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.880]   Yes.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.160]   So Steve gets us talked about Passkey.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.920]   This is something, an initiative from Google Microsoft
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.360]   and now very much Apple to eliminate passwords.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.160]   And I think that in a few years you're going to look back
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.240]   on passwords and say, that was a bad thing.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.720]   I think a lot of us have been trying to get past it
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.120]   and past the Passkey and I think, or past the password.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.240]   And I think that was probably the most important announcement.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.280]   Huge.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:20.800]   Yesterday.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.160]   Huge.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.960]   Was the fact that we're going to get to a point where we're
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.720]   building into the infrastructure that, and I think it's going to be transform
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.720]   transformational to the whole world.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.600]   Because as people start to get out of that and start, and because it's
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.640]   being supported by a lot of other people, it could potentially be a really big deal.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.480]   Well, it doubles down on the biometrics that Apple is now basically putting everywhere.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.880]   And I expect to see biometric keyboards for the desktops as well.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.440]   Because now using biometrics, Face ID or Touch ID,
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.840]   you can have an absolutely phishing proof log in to apps and websites.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.080]   And you don't need a password.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.960]   You don't need a password manager.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.520]   That's going to be very, very big.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.480]   The thing that is really important though is that Apple is pairing that up with other
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.400]   privacy initiatives.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.680]   Because the real thing now is that we will know who you are and we have to protect what
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   that means.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   That's right.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.320]   In a bigger, in a bigger, because we will absolutely know that you're on that computer
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.000]   and it's you interacting.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.560]   And that's going to be a, that's a, it's a tricky problem is that, you know, people
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.720]   have been able to say, well, I don't know if that was me or not.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.720]   You won't be able to say that anymore.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   And so.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   That may be good.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.720]   No, no, I, no, I think it's great.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.600]   No, I think that might be a big improvement.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.520]   You've been the one arguing to eliminate anonymity online.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.040]   Yeah, I don't, I think that it's great.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.880]   It's going to change the way we interact with people, but there are people that are puts
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.760]   in danger that need to be able to be, you know, so we just have to kind of weigh that
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   out.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.640]   And I think that the company that is probably the most ahead of that is Apple thinking about
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.920]   how are we going to keep us private, even the, but authenticated.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:57.680]   Well, I think that's also why they announced what was it safe, safe kit or.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.280]   What are the personal safety?
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.840]   They, they, safety check, safety check.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.440]   And I saw a number of women, quite a few women on Twitter saying this is, you don't
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.000]   even understand how important this is.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.080]   This is huge for domestic violence victims, for partners of crazy people, for people who
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.440]   want to, you know, separate their identity.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.280]   And I think it maybe goes hand in hand with Paskey.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.080]   In other words, if you're going to have Paskey, you need safety check.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.320]   Apple pays attention to this stuff.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   God bless them.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.920]   And of course, they learned their lesson with their tags.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.680]   And I think that also heightened their awareness, you know, anything else we want to say about
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.880]   iPad, OS, weather.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.360]   We're so, we're, we're, we're such an Apple people.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360]   Oh my God.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   Thank God.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   Well, thank you, Apple.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   You gave us a weather app.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   They led with that.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   They knew.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.160]   We know that, we know that, we know that a built in calculator app is way too much to
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.280]   ask, but we're so thrilled we get to know what the weather is.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   I actually there was there was one thing that I wanted to ask Alex about that.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.920]   What do you, what do you think about reference mode on the iPad?
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.560]   What is reference mode?
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.240]   Once I see it, I'm super excited about it.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.400]   I was really excited.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.480]   So reference mode is the idea that it one of the things that when we're trying to work
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   on a project, you know, that we used to joke that NTSC meant never the same color.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480]   Same color.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:25.240]   You know, and so you, you don't know, like a lot of
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.960]   times I use my iPhone.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.240]   Literally, I turn off whatever my, you know, yell, you know, I warm, I have a warm view
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.800]   on my iPhone all the time.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.600]   But if I don't do that, I turn it off and I look at a live stream and I consider most
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.520]   the time that is the most accurate view I have of the color, you know, like, of how
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.000]   the color looks because Apple spends so much time on it.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.680]   But having a reference mode that says we're going to turn off everything else, we're going
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.320]   to not make any corrections.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   This is a very accurate and for them to call it reference mode, I feel like they're putting
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.800]   a lot of effort into it.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.160]   So if I look at those colors of the real, that is incredible.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.600]   If you're sending out an iPad, I mean, it makes for an ad agency for a production company,
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.200]   it makes these iPads almost required issue.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   Interesting.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.120]   Because now I can send you something and you go into reference mode and you look at it
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.360]   and you say, okay, that I want that yellow to be 2% less green or whatever that is, they
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.160]   can make those adjustments.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.200]   And we can, and we have a single point of the truth and theoretically, if everybody's
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.560]   in reference mode and they're getting the same signal, it just means that they all have
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   colors that agree on.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.200]   They can have those conversations.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.040]   It's a huge problem.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.400]   Like we have reference monitors that we don't trust because they're what, you know, what
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   is the ET lab?
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   It's the ETL.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.040]   They're putting liquid retina on the MacBook here.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.800]   Is that important to it?
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800]   It's somewhat.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.840]   The Mac, MacBook Air, I mean, the display is fine.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.600]   You know, like it's, well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.600]   It's putting up a good bit.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.600]   Yeah, I'm not.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:17:00.480]   I mean, I would actually trust the iPad in reference mode more than, you know, it's something,
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.240]   it's being able to say, I trust this to be accurate.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.760]   Now it's not going to be 100% accurate.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.800]   There's, you know, you can get these much more expensive, you know, $10,000, $20,000
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.240]   monitors that we pay attention to our colorists use, but I can't afford that.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.000]   So I need something that I can look at.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   And I think that this being outboard, like having an iPad that I look over at and I send
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   something out from resolve or send something out from Final Cut and look at it and go,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   okay, am I happy with those colors?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.240]   And I have a fairly good idea that I'm pretty close to a good source of the truth.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.240]   I think is important.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.960]   My case pulled up the privacy and the security page.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.040]   So here's the prediction that I'd like to make.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.200]   I think this is very interesting.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.960]   It wasn't covered on stage, but it was something that flew by at the platform state of the
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   union.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.600]   If you go on the beta privacy and security and you scroll all the way down, there's a
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.080]   new thing under security called developer mode.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.160]   And I want to read the text before I make my prediction.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.240]   It says, if you're developing apps for Apple products, developer mode allows you to use
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.720]   features that are required for app development.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.520]   When developer mode is turned on, your device security will be reduced.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   This is on the eye.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   My prediction.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.520]   This is on the iPad.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.520]   It'll be on the iPhone as well.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.920]   This is an iOS iPad OS feature that lets developers right now install their apps and
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.160]   do tests.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.480]   I think this is laying the groundwork for a future in which Apple is forced to allow
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.720]   sideloading.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.000]   This is like an in case we need to do this, we have this now switch.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.640]   Instead of test flight, you can kind of turn on this low security mode and sideload
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   apps.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   I think this is them putting that in there.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.800]   Like the way Android does it where it's there, you have to look for it.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.800]   You have to dig for it.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   But they have to ask that if you know.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   It doesn't have to.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.720]   But the assumption is that if you know to look for it, then clearly you are at least
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.440]   on your way to understanding that you're taking a risk and you're doing something outside
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   the norm.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.720]   That's an interesting good catch.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.720]   Very interesting catch.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.640]   I probably shouldn't downplay the importance of the changes to messages either as Google
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.520]   continues to stumble with the Android messaging.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.320]   Apple has just getting better and better.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.680]   Now they have editing in messages.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.680]   They also have 50, you can edit any message within 15 minutes.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:20.440]   You can pull back a message within 15 minutes so you can un-send.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.160]   They're also much improving dictation.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.240]   The keyboard will stay up.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.560]   You'll be able to edit your dictation as you go.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.880]   I think this is also going to be a life-changing improvement.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   I think it is.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.600]   I think that the, I think this also is one of the reasons that Apple wouldn't be able
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.960]   to integrate with another message system because you probably can't do that.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   It's green bubble.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.760]   So, you know, it's going to be a lot of messages that interaction between it would have to
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.040]   be their own servers to be able to execute them.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.840]   Shareplay via messages, collaborating via messages.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.960]   This is very, you know, this is, this is that thing Apple does so well.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   It's great for users.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.160]   It's also great for the business because it really locks you into the ecosystem.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.960]   Well, and also someone says, well, you should just interact with the Apple.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   Well, we've got a lot of things that we can't do.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.000]   Well, we can turn off all those great features, I guess.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.720]   But to be fair, you could simply enable the features that you can cross-communicate with
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.800]   and just simply reserve the ones that you can.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800]   Well, they do.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   You got a text message bubble, right?
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.360]   You got the SMM bubble.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   Good luck to you.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.200]   We can't do sensorif text or non-mono space text with a desktop message.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.800]   Our hands are just tied.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.800]   I do think that when I looked at the photo sharing, you know, they showed the new photo
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.680]   sharing where you can have these shared photo libraries.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.320]   And I can already see there's like two holdouts in my family that don't have iPhones that
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   are going to get a lot of them.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   They're all going, right?
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320]   We're sharing this whole library.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.040]   It's going to be great except for you two.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.760]   Well, and you're going to sell a lot of iPhones because Apple has said that iOS 16 will only
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.640]   be available on iPhone 8s and later.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:09.160]   If you have an iPad that's not a pro, a lot of the new features will require a pro.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.800]   Although you will be able to do external displays supported on an iPad Air as well, but not the
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   least expensive iPad, nothing.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:21.040]   A lot of people are pretty salty about all the features that are M1 iPad-prone-exclusive
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.800]   instead of just like two years ago.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.400]   Will you live in reference mode, Alex?
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.200]   Or will you go back and forth?
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.160]   No, I'm probably not living it.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:37.880]   I actually keep my monitors really warm because I feel like if I leave everything regular
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.120]   white by the end of the day, I feel like someone's drilled.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   Literally, I've been looking into the sun.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.000]   I have a tendency.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.800]   My phone is usually turned down to less than half and it's warm because it just bothers
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.480]   me a lot less.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.280]   I think that I probably keep that way.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.480]   Most of my monitors are very...
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.640]   So then when I want to do something with color, I flip them to a more neutral state so I can
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.120]   definitely see myself going back and forth.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   Mike, if you can...
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.400]   I don't know if they'll change this in the future, but right now when you turn on reference
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.320]   mode, it does this really frightening flash of the screen that's sort of severe before
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.560]   it changes.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.240]   And it made me a little bit like, "Oh, should I even be doing this?"
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.720]   It says, "If you do this, it will affect battery life."
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.400]   And then there's fine-tuned calibration.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.560]   So you'll see here measured versus target calibration points.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.960]   I don't know how any of it works, obviously, but yeah, that's...
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   It's not for us.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.880]   That is not for you and me.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   That is for others.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:37.200]   Do you think that maybe that's because of the display technology where if they really
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.040]   are serious about reference mode, they have to set each pixel to the same state or the
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.000]   same electrical state before?
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.440]   Oh, so it has to actually...
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   That makes sense.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   There's also a...
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   Makes sense to me, what you're saying.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   Can you play with it?
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.000]   I don't know if you have the display scaling mode, which answers my issue with running out
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.480]   of real estate.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.640]   I don't understand quite how that works, but the idea is increasing the pixel density
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.120]   of the display, in other words, turning up the resolution, you can see more.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.440]   Oh, yeah, here it is.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   So there are three options, zoomed and standard, which we've always had.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.360]   Now there's an option called "more space."
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360]   So I'll set that.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.880]   Oh, it's just use more space.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.040]   Oh, they have to restart the iPad.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   So that's going to go...
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040]   Okay, so you could...
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.720]   Okay, so it's just another scaling...
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.920]   It's just another scaling setting, really.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.920]   It's not like I have infinite...
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.520]   There's no slider.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.680]   Yeah, it's not slider.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.360]   So is the native resolution of the iPad significantly more than what it's actually using?
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.160]   It must be.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.800]   It must be set at a doubled resolution.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.240]   Yeah, I wish that I could show you quickly a swap between the two, but this is the new
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.000]   "more resolution" mode.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   Oh, it looks...
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.400]   There's a little bit more room.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   These three were stacked next to each other, and there was no room on the right side for
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   more.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.360]   So you could get a little bit more and more.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.760]   But if you do use a multi-window situation like that, you probably want to stay in that.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.920]   Yeah, if you're in stage manager a lot.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:03.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.880]   I saw another user who had the beta say that the maximum number of non-overlapping windows
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.800]   you could fit in as iPad were for, like iPhone with...
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.240]   It doesn't look pretty.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.240]   I hate to imagine a world in which I would wish to buy a third-party window manager for
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.800]   the iPad.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.880]   But honestly, that's one of the things I've been asking, I've been really hoping for for
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:34.960]   a long time, but sometimes on the iPad, I really do want to have like two, not just half of
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.960]   an iPad display, half an iPad display.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.800]   I kind of want like just two iPhone columns, and then the rest of it be the piece that I'm
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.560]   working on because I want to keep an eye on a Twitter flag, and I also want to keep an
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   eye on my inbox.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.000]   I figured you probably played with the Henry and Mitzi mode a little bit too, Micah, the
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.680]   ability to pop your pets out.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.680]   Pull things out.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.680]   Yes.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.720]   I was actually surprised at the quality of it because I thought that it was going to
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.720]   be pretty...
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.000]   The corners would be blurred, it'd be a little weird, but I was actually pretty impressed.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.840]   So I did it with, this morning on iOS today, we did it with some pets, and we also did
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   it with...
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.320]   I had a photo that was mostly just a coffee mug, and I was able to take and pull out the
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.320]   coffee mug.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.880]   It looks like you could turn a pet into a sticker in effect.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.000]   You could lift the subject from the background, paste it in messages, now you have a Mitzi
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   sticker.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.760]   So they don't actually...
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   So that's what it did seem like at first that they were stickers, but they are just photos
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.760]   that you could send.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   They're just photos without a background.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.280]   So let me show you real quick just on this.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.200]   So this is the mug, and if I just tap and hold on the mug where there's not text, it's
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.840]   important to not do a part where there's text, because if you do, then it's going to
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.440]   do the auto text selection.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.840]   But also select a portion of the mug and then move it.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   Look at that.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.440]   Now you'll see I've got this little mug that I could then swipe over and drop into messages
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   and send some.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440]   Okay, that's pretty cool.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440]   That was that fast.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.440]   Yeah, I just held down and moved.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   And that's not a heterogeneous...
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:08.040]   You know, on a green screen, you've got a very complicated background.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.040]   Exactly.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040]   That's the...
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.080]   Alex, you think that's the depth in the image?
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.960]   Will it work better with the image?
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   It's a lot of...
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.920]   Adobe's been doing a lot of work here, and a lot of other folks have been doing a lot
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920]   of work here.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:20.920]   So it's probably...
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.520]   It's a lot of machine learning that's there and it's trained and it's looking for things
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.600]   that it's looking for hard edges.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.400]   I'd love to see that in a more fluffy hair kind of thing as far as...
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.400]   Yeah, sometimes fun.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.160]   So that's a little bit harder to do that calculation, but not impossible.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.680]   Adobe's been doing that for maybe five years.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.720]   So I mean, they've showed it for a decade of them doing different levels of it.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   And so I think that...
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.120]   It's a magic eraser.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.120]   It's edge detection.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.120]   It's clipping.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   So it's those features.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   But what's different is that Apple has the hardware.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.080]   And so what Apple's, I think, doing is using...
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.640]   And I would guess potentially the neural engine to do some of those things where it's really
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.560]   smartly grabbing that.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.640]   And there's no reason for it to take any time if it's got dedicated processing to make it.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   It's interesting you mentioned, Michael, if you clicked on the text, it would then make
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   that live text.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   Yep, it would.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.480]   I would have it highlighted that text.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.440]   Okay, you could cut and paste it and so forth.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.440]   That's really...
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.200]   And they showed it, of course, because it's developers.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.640]   How often you've watched a YouTube video with code in it, and you can cut the code,
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   cut and paste it.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.320]   Oh, look, that's a hard one.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   What is that?
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.640]   So this is a Highland cow that I crocheted for someone for Christmas.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.720]   And so it's got some fibers and things up in the top corners.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.520]   And the one thing that gets wrong here, which is understandable, because there's a plant
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.480]   in the way, you'll notice that when I pull on this...
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.480]   It's cut off by the leaf.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.040]   Yeah, it does get...
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   Well, now I've got...
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.760]   Does it be expected to completely rebuild?
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:55.040]   It's only in beta, but the real one, of course, we expect to completely rebuild that yard.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   I'm just kidding.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.200]   Yeah, the exact same part.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.200]   So...
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   But it does a very good job of taking out the edge.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.600]   Yeah, you have to put it on some white and let's go to multi-wind-dome.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.800]   Yeah, let me all do that.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.800]   I'm just trying to be mindful of people's privacy while doing this, so...
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   I know.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:18.960]   You're going to show how we did the cover art for our show yesterday with Memojis.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.920]   And I realized that I have to be in messages.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920]   There we go.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   And then I had all these messages.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   Oh, yeah, you can't show messages.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.560]   Messages on iPad is bad because it'll show everyone else's messages.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.120]   There's a few errors up in the upper right.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.200]   Yeah, it's not super not bad.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.280]   To do it that quickly is very impressive.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.320]   I mean, especially look around the tongue here.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.360]   That's good enough.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   That's good enough.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360]   Holy cow.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.160]   That's really good.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160]   Wow.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160]   And also it's a good starting point.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.000]   I could then take that into an app and pull off my Apple Pencil and start...
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.640]   Yeah, but they know no one's going to do that.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.400]   They know that this is just for you.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.400]   Exactly.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   It's not.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.240]   To do, you know, cut out the back, cut out the ex-boyfriend or whatever.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.200]   But if that were featuring the photos app, you could just put a slider to say, "Be a little
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.800]   bit more aggressive, be less aggressive."
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.800]   Right.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800]   Right.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800]   That's such a big deal.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800]   I suspect that.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   That's a good idea about the keynote.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.560]   And in the sense that this is why I have like a whole other like sub-head and my OmniOutlanner
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:19.720]   doc is about, "Here is all the things that are kind of cool about what Google does that
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.560]   they are now saying, "That's a good idea.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.560]   Let's do that.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.160]   That wouldn't be too hard for us to do that.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.440]   Let's do it ourselves."
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:31.000]   And or, "Let's do something that historically people thought that will only Google has a
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.720]   really great maps app.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:38.400]   Any Google does really good document collaboration or really good translate or if the Google
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.480]   lends us really cool, let's show that we can actually do that too."
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.760]   And so why would you use the Google version of it when ours is so much more private?
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760]   I want to take a little break.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.760]   I want to come back.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.480]   Apple did do something else that I thought was interesting.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.680]   They announced a new app.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:55.880]   And it's unclear exactly what the intent is, but I'd love to get, I think it's deeper
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:56.880]   than it looks.
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:03.440]   But we'll find out with our esteemed panel, Michael Sargent and Iannako, Alex Lindsey.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:09.480]   Renee is, of course, on assignment somewhere deep within the confines of the Apple campus.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.880]   I got to see him briefly yesterday and he's very okay.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.880]   So he's still alive.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.480]   He's not too hard to handle the back of the skull.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.840]   Yeah, I drove down after we finished our event and I got done with some stuff just so
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.920]   I, because I knew that there were going to be a few folks there that I knew.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.880]   Did you have to like stand outside the gate and say, "I'm out here?"
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:33.120]   But basically, that's pretty much what I had to do for Renee.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.840]   Other people I was able to see, but he was very, very busy.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.440]   And so I got to give him a little pat on the shoulder and say, "Hi."
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.840]   And then he's having fun, I bet.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.080]   Yeah, he seems to be.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.280]   He's in Hog Heaven, as they say.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280]   Well, good.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.160]   Well, I know we'll have a lot more to talk about next week when Renee comes back.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.480]   He's getting all those briefings right now.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.320]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Land.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.280]   I have in my life, and I think I'm not alone in this.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.680]   I hope I'm not alone, been trying to get rid of single-use plastics.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.680]   Plastic bags, plastic bottles.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.480]   I even shave old school now with a metal racer plate that I can take out of the metal handle
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.080]   and put in a little tin.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.200]   This is something that I found that has really changed our lives at home.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.120]   It's called Blue Land, and it's an answer to a big problem.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:31.200]   Did you know that more than 5 billion with a B-plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.360]   are thrown away every year?
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.960]   And they land in the landfill and they will never go away.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.320]   They don't biodegrade.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.640]   They're not contrary to what the plastic industry tells you.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.600]   They're not recyclable, really easily recyclable.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:50.800]   And then, if that weren't bad enough, when you buy those hand soaps and the cleaning solutions,
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.840]   they're 90% water.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.640]   So you're shipping all this water all over the country for no good reason.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:59.080]   Blue Land solves this problem.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:04.240]   Stop wasting water, stop throwing out plastic, get Blue Land's revolutionary refill cleaning
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   system.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:09.040]   Instead, Blue Land was founded on the belief that the cleaner planet starts by eliminating
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.720]   plastic waste while creating powerful, effective cleaners for your entire home.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.920]   This is an example of the Blue Land by once refill forever bottle.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:25.120]   This one's lightweight because it's a multi-surface cleaner, so you want to have it lightweight.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.840]   The hand cleaner bottles, which I now have in every sink in the house and every sink
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:35.400]   here at work too, they're heavy glass because you don't want them to move.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.040]   So you get them, you're going to keep reusing them, and then Blue Land, you can subscribe
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.520]   or just ask for it on demand.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.160]   I actually have them send me a text message that says, "We think you're about to be out.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Should we send you some more?"
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   I say, "Yes."
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:51.240]   This is the little cleaning solution, the multi-surface cleaning solution.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.360]   It's just a tablet.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.840]   You fill this up with warm water, you put in the tablet, it dissolves, and now you have
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:00.160]   a very good multi-surface cleaning solution.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:09.600]   They have window cleaners, I use their dish washing soap, I use their dishwasher soap,
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.920]   I use their washing machine tablets, their toilet tablets, believe it or not, are so popular
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:18.760]   they sell out all the time they are now in stock, so get them.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.600]   The Blue Land toilet tablet cleaner, it's so easy.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.960]   I love all of this.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.480]   Instead of shipping around a lot of water and plastic bottles, you're just going to throw
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.480]   out.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:32.800]   They just ship you the active ingredients, and that's fantastic.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.600]   I have to say, the only thing you'll have to throw out is your outdated idea that eco-friendly
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.000]   products are more costly and less effective.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.560]   This saves you money, this saves the world's plastic waste, and you get a great cleaner.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.880]   By the way, the cents are fantastic.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.800]   We use the unscented stuff for the laundry and so forth, so they have a variety.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.440]   You can do that too, but the hand soap, I always get the cents.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.560]   Iris agave, or Perrin lemon, or lavender eucalyptus, they have special cents for different times
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.560]   of the year.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.560]   At Christmas time, I got all my hands smelling like gingerbread cookies, and I thought that
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.120]   was kind of fun.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.600]   From their best-selling clean essentials kit to their hand soap duo, to their plastic-free
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.600]   laundry and dishwasher tablets, Blue Land is something for every inch of your home.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:28.080]   By the way, another thing to try, it's not exactly to save plastic, although it does
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.640]   save dryer sheets, I guess.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.920]   They sell wool balls.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.520]   We bought these three wool balls you put in the dryer, eliminate static, dries the clothes
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.720]   faster.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.200]   So another, I love these things.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.720]   Blue Land's stunning high-quality forever bottles started just $10 when you buy a kit.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.960]   They are meant to be reused forever with money-saving refill tablets, and the tablet started just
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   $2.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.280]   Because you're just paying for the active ingredients, and not everything else.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.000]   I think this is brilliant.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   Try Blue Land today.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   You will love it.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.640]   It's a great housewarming gift, a gift for friends and family.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   When my daughter got a new apartment, I mentioned this before, I set her up with the whole thing.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.720]   It's just great.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.520]   Right now you get 20% off your first order when you go to Blue Land, B-L-U-E-L-A-N-D,
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:25.040]   blueland.com/macbreak, 20% off your first order of Blue Land products, 20% off.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040]   That's a good deal.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.040]   Blueland.com/macbreak.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.240]   Do it for yourself, but do it for the planet too.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.880]   It's really great.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.040]   Blueland.com/macbreak.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.200]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.640]   So I don't know if this is going to be a big deal or not.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.200]   It's not unusual that Apple will announce a new app like Clips.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   It just doesn't go anywhere.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:54.720]   But I feel like this is something designed for use in the iPad and the Mac that could
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.400]   actually change the way we work that could be more collaborative on its surface freeform,
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.560]   which is coming later this year.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.840]   Looks like just a shared whiteboard, big deal.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.920]   There's tons of those.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.880]   But you can embed video in it.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.560]   You can embed web links in it.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.640]   You can embed documents in it.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.360]   I don't know.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.360]   Alex, did the office hours folks think anything of this or was it just--
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.480]   I have to admit we kind of--
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.480]   A throwaway.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.480]   --lost over it.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.040]   I think we just saw it and we're like, OK, we can draw on it.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.000]   I mean, I--
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   Sorry.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.240]   I feel like it's more than a whiteboard.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.800]   I feel like it's almost like Google waves.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.800]   Potentially.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.360]   I mean, I think that it's interesting.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.880]   I think that until we play with it, it's hard to tell how well it will work.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.880]   I thought it's significant that it's also an iPad app.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.960]   So I don't know whether they're just simply
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.360]   trying to beef up Mac OS and Apple's own built-in apps
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.560]   as a productivity suite as a way to buttress
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.240]   against the power of the Google Suite.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.400]   Or they could have just simply said, just like the Notes app,
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.920]   this is something cool that we can do that someone did a head start on.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.960]   And we liked it enough to decide that let's just roll it into the OS.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.080]   But this is the sort of beard stroking I do like three hours
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.880]   after I've been doing nothing but thinking about the keynote
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.040]   and what things I thought might happen didn't happen.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.920]   But it seems as though it's in line with a lot of things
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.680]   that I was perceiving that it is-- if you think about it as a shared space
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:28.480]   with people where people come in and exchange things and collaborate,
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.320]   is this a distant early warning symbol of what we're going to be seeing them do
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.960]   with the AR headset?
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.160]   Given that sharing is now not just simply a feature
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.240]   that they've done to achieve parity for productivity apps,
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.840]   but there is a sharing API.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   There is a collaboration.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:51.480]   Maybe this is the-- I could imagine this being like the precursor to a framework
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.440]   that basically says that any time you want to have a shared space
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.120]   where people are coming in and participating virtually and manipulating
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.480]   the same objects, here is the starters of the framework you're going to be using
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.040]   to do that.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.440]   It's not hard to imagine something like that.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.520]   I wouldn't make that a prediction of any kind,
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.280]   but given that we're all thinking about AR at the moment,
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.160]   that it's hard not to think about that so soon before the end of the year
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.240]   or January, which is when we're expecting to see hardware.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:26.200]   And I really expect-- you're watching this very slow, lumbering approach
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.600]   to the AR solution that it definitely could be part of that.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.880]   And I think that that's what Apple's doing with that a lot of companies
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.240]   just don't have the time to do.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.840]   And the money to do is to not be in a rush to make sure they get it out right
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.520]   and to build an entire ecosystem around it so that when you turn it on,
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.280]   it's like, oh, and then we're adding this and now everything makes sense.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.480]   And I think that that's a level of--
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.560]   I mean, I think Apple probably started working on this headset 10 years ago.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:59.880]   It's not-- and so I think that that's a very slow lumbering process
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.760]   to build the entire ecosystem out, not just build it
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.760]   and hope they come.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.040]   Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.640]   I didn't thought about the AR thing.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.800]   I just-- to me, why write something that already exists
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.920]   unless this is going to be a piece of a larger puzzle?
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.840]   And maybe AR is part of it.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.800]   Apple did a lot of things about collaboration that I thought was interesting.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.920]   This reminds me of Notion, which you and I--
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.120]   Micah have used.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.040]   They didn't say whether it's persistent, but I assume it's a persistent space
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.480]   that all the participants can come and go and it'll live on.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:40.000]   So if you're planning a trip to-- with somebody, I'd use Notion for that.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.040]   And then I create a document that Lisa can see with all the information in it
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.080]   that she needs.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.600]   I just feel like-- and Microsoft, by the way, has announced something similar called
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.720]   Loop.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.200]   And the reason Microsoft's doing it is because they can put components from all
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.880]   of their apps in it, an Excel spreadsheet or a Word document,
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.200]   and much more there's a developer API.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.200]   I feel like there is something brewing here in the collaborative space,
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.560]   maybe the VR space.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.040]   Yeah, imagine if instead of white, you had nothing.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.840]   And you were wearing this and these things were floating in your vision.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.360]   That would be kind of interesting.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.960]   Imagine that being a 3D space instead of a 2D space.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.040]   I don't know.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.080]   It's just puzzling to me that they would--
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:25.760]   and you're right, Andy.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.480]   Somebody just-- somebody had written it and said, oh, yeah, we can release that too.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.960]   It will come on Mac, iPadOS, and iOS.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.680]   So that's interesting.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.960]   It's just that there was such a recurring theme throughout the presentation,
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.160]   just collaboration everywhere.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.480]   And not even just as, hey, we wired up this feature so that pages could work with groups.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.080]   It's like, no, here is an API so that even if a third-party developer wants
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.680]   to make a collaborative app, they don't have to roll their own solution,
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.280]   they can just use our own APIs.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   And it's good for business.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:56.800]   It stuck out.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.920]   Because it uses messages.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.960]   It uses FaceTime.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.040]   It uses all the technologies.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.720]   So anyway, maybe I'm making more of it than it deserves.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.880]   Beard stroking.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.520]   But that's what we do.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.120]   That's our job.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:13.760]   That's what we do for the 24 to 48 hours after keynote.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:16.680]   iOS 16, any big--
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.960]   Micah, you and Rosemary, probably, are excited about shortcuts and enhanced shortcut features.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.120]   Yeah, Rosemary in particular, obviously.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.440]   One of the things that they've done in shortcuts is that little remove background thing is a shortcut
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:31.960]   feature.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.600]   So you can actually set up a shortcut where you can feed it a bunch of photos and say,
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.080]   take the background out of all of those.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.760]   And then you get the photos back with just the subject that's at the front.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.520]   There, honestly, it would take us hours to go through all of the changes.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.040]   There was so much.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.760]   Lock screen was the thing they started with.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:53.000]   And that also uses the cutout feature because, for instance, the numbers and the clock
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.280]   are behind your head or behind the Joshua tree or whatever.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:05.640]   And it's funny because this is a feature that Google had in Android and took out.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.040]   Is this lock screen, all these widgets, all of this live stuff?
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:16.160]   But really, also-- and some people who analyze the code of iOS 16 see this in the code,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:22.000]   supports a feature that is rumored to be coming with the next iPhone, which is an always-on
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]   lock screen.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.160]   So now you might have an always-on display on your phone that has all sorts of information
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:28.680]   in there.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.680]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.400]   I've got that on my pixel.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.400]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   I'll just guess.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.440]   I think we're saying the same thing.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.200]   Imagine basically having a smart display that's just in your pocket at the time that
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.520]   you don't actually have to wake it.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.960]   You don't actually have to fire up an app to get the information that you want.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.400]   Imagine an Apple Watch complication thing where you can just pick out your phone like
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.320]   a pocket watch, check it, then put it back in your pocket.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.200]   The way the watch-- I really think that's going to be big.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.440]   The way the watch makes that work is by slowing down to 1 hertz, like really slowing the display
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.440]   down.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.800]   The iPhone can't currently do that, but that is thought to be a variable refresh feature
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.560]   of iPhone 14.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.560]   Go ahead, Micah.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.280]   I was just going to say, well, two things.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.640]   One, I have been comparing this new lock screen feature to just basically they took what you
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.800]   could do on an Apple Watch and blew it up.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.640]   And so it's just like having an Apple Watch on your home screen, which is very cool.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.720]   And now they've combined those technologies.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:30.040]   So a developer who designs a widget/complication, those now fall in the same kind of code base.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:35.360]   So it's very easy to have them for both the Apple Watch and the iPhone, which again makes
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.720]   more developers more likely to add those complications, those widgets to be able to
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.480]   access across devices.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:45.800]   I think the one thing that I'm curious-- I mean, Apple's done a pretty good job on the
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.680]   Apple Watch with having the always on screen and the battery life being good.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.120]   But when it comes to the Pixel, I've noticed that it does impact the battery, which makes
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.440]   sense to have an always on screen.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.240]   Obviously, if the screen is always odd, there will be some impact to battery.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.920]   I'm curious what Apple will do and that give and take to try and maintain as much battery
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.760]   life as possible.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:12.760]   The only thing I'll say about that is that the number one thing that affected my battery
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760]   was Facebook.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.000]   Oh, it was the least.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.640]   So I still go on Facebook from my desktop, but I do not have that on phone.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.520]   I don't have that Instagram.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.880]   Anything that is a-- because there's just so much whatever it's doing, there is so much
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:28.880]   going on.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.880]   You know what it's doing.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.880]   But I'm amazed at--
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.320]   It's constantly telling me that what you're up to.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.280]   Like right now, I get up at 4 o'clock in the morning, 4.30 in the morning, and I took
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.280]   it off the charger.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.880]   Like that's the last time it saw charging, and it's now 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.240]   and I've used 10% on my phone.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:50.200]   And I've been using it on and off all morning.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:56.960]   So anyway, I just think that it may impact the battery, but there's a lot of things that
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.600]   impact the battery on your phone.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   And this--
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.600]   Audible is the biggest impact to my battery.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   Yeah, because you listen all the time.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600]   I do.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600]   Me too.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.280]   I love the idea that having widgets that are live, they showed a map.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.440]   For instance, as you're navigating, you don't have to turn your phone on.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.840]   It's always there.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.840]   If you're waiting for a delivery, you can see a timeline.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.720]   I could see a lot of stuff happening with this lock screen.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:28.040]   It's one of those features that users are going to have to put some work into, like focus,
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.680]   which means 99% of users won't do a thing with it.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.040]   But for those who really care, you'll have a lot more functionality.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.040]   I wonder how Apple is going to sort of figure that in with their usual dogma, which is
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.840]   that we are so committed to making sure that our users have a good time with our products,
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.440]   that we are not going to allow them to have a bad time with our products.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:54.280]   Meaning that if they were able to say that, well, this will cost you 10% of your battery
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.600]   life, but so we're not going to let you even make that swap, make that choice if you want
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   to make it.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:05.120]   Anything else in iOS that we should talk about?
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.080]   Mail and Safari updated a little bit.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.000]   Somebody was saying it's the biggest update to Mail ever.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000]   I don't know.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000]   I know you should know.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000]   I can't.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.200]   It's nice to have stuff that I've had.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.200]   Every other app.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:24.200]   Being able to basically, if you send an email, we have a certain countdown timer to say,
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.920]   "Actually, please unsun that."
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.880]   Some editing features, that's where stuff.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.880]   It's nice.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.160]   There's a reason why I don't use the Mail.app as my mail app because it's just not as muscular
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.240]   as pretty much anything else out there.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.040]   Anytime that they give you better features, that's a nice thing.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.960]   Not to be poo-pooed, but it's definitely, you realize that you're like the third guest
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.680]   on the tonight show or on the Letterman show, and Robin Williams is guest number one.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.400]   You know that you're ready to go on stage at the keynote, but you're probably going
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.320]   to get bumped if you're there to talk about new features in Mail.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:00.120]   I just remembered something.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.880]   So firstly, one of the things is that a lot of the features that we've talked about that
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:06.440]   are the big ones are multi-platform features.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.440]   Yes.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.560]   So we've covered a lot of that stuff anyway.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:15.360]   But one that I actually learned yesterday on my trip down south, I didn't realize that
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.680]   this was the case.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.680]   You now can, so you remember iCloud Plus, right?
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:28.560]   The feature set that gives you the ability to turn on the device tracking protections
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.080]   that are sort of next level.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.880]   It also gives you the ability to create masked emails where they will generate kind of a
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.800]   fake email for you so that you don't get that spam or that you can kind of monitor what's
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.800]   ending up selling your information.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:48.800]   Well, now right within these settings, when you go into iCloud Plus, you can actually
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:53.000]   buy domains to set up your own custom.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.680]   Yes, they're using CloudFlare for this.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.840]   CloudFlare just became a registrar not too long ago, I think within the past three or
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.920]   four months.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.320]   And Apple is doing the management right there so you can use your Apple account to actually
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:14.400]   purchase a domain and set up your own private email that does that hide my email setting.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.760]   So I thought that was a really interesting thing that was very, very buried.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.600]   But just sort of being able to be right in those settings and make a purchase of a custom
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:28.680]   domain without having to go elsewhere was kind of an interesting thing.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.600]   You've always said, Alex, that Apple should get into financial services.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.960]   And they snuck a little thing in there that actually puts them into an interesting position
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.680]   with financial services.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:46.600]   Apple Pay later, there are basically financing purchases and not just for Apple products,
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.920]   but for a lot of people, they said Shopify will be the first company to use this.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.120]   This is Buy Now Pay later.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.760]   They had to figure out something to do with all that cash.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.960]   We'll lend it up.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.520]   I think that I don't know if they're using an external finance, but because they're not
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:09.400]   charging interest, I don't know what an external group would want to do with it.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.120]   So it does feel like they're using their own cash to back it up.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.120]   So yeah.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:21.080]   A US only and probably forever because of banking regulations around the world and how
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.160]   complicated those are.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:28.240]   It does feel like they just keep getting closer to being a bank.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.720]   I mean, this is not something that consumers get this from a lot of places.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.520]   It's not something that people are saying, well, Apple Pay has to have it, but it sure
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:41.880]   promotes the use of Apple Pay by a lot of merchants who don't have these features, right?
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.160]   I mean, I think the big thing is for Apple is it's not so much that whether it's available
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.440]   somewhere else, it's just that a lot of Apple users wanted to be available inside of their
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440]   little cocoon.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.440]   Right.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.440]   Apple doesn't even have to do it as well.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.720]   It has to do 80% as good as everybody else as long as it's inside the ecosystem and they
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.920]   don't have to think about it.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.160]   A lot of Apple users will just be like, okay, that's what I wanted to.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.800]   Like, I mean, like the Apple Maps, which I now believe are pretty close to on par with
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.800]   Google Maps.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.800]   That's what they were saying.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:11.400]   When it came out, it was not definitely not as good, but still 60% of iPhone users were using
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.320]   it because when I click on something, it shows up.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.200]   And so that's part of the issue.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.040]   But that is a danger.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.680]   The more Apple gets into these more traditional banking features, the more that they're putting
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.400]   the goodwill that they've built with their customers at risk.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:34.440]   If people think that, oh, well, gosh, I've never done this, hey, pay nothing now, wait
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.360]   for a few months.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.440]   But I've never accepted those terms because I know there must be something where once
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:47.320]   I start payments, if I'm late, they're suddenly like a 50% tariff or 50% fee.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.000]   The first time that someone says, hey, I trust Apple not to screw me over on a credit deal
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:58.080]   or on a loan deal or on a pay later deal, suddenly this they become not the trustworthy
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:01.520]   place that is not going to steal my information that is going to treat me well, that's going
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:05.080]   to treat me fairly, and it becomes, oh, I shouldn't have trusted them at all.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.520]   I just had a horrible experience with Apple.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.440]   I'm never going to recommend them to anybody ever again.
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:12.840]   Yeah, but what an opportunity to be the good guy.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:13.840]   True.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:14.840]   Right.
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:19.640]   So I'm keen to see again, if someone can't come up with the money, is it a straight repo
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:25.240]   and you're fine or is it, no, you're still on the hook for $2,000 computer only now with
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.160]   a $2,400 computer?
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:30.680]   It does say it's eligibility based on eligibility.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.440]   They're not getting anybody do for payments.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.840]   So there's a little, the fine print and so the, my guess is that the rating has to be
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:44.440]   pretty high and people with higher ratings are pretty obsessive about paying them.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]   Right.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.880]   But people's circumstances do change as we found over the past two or three years where
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.880]   you're fine.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:54.800]   You're fine last year and you thought, oh, well, gosh, I'm buying a new car, a new house,
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:55.800]   and a new Mac.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:58.920]   And suddenly you're living in your car and you can't pay for the Mac.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:01.680]   At least you have a new Mac.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.680]   You can't live in your car.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.560]   You can just leave it in your car.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.320]   I will wrap up with this.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.920]   I thought it was really interesting.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:16.960]   And what they talked about with a car play, I thought it's kind of signaled that they want
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:17.960]   to build a car.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.480]   I don't know if I'm wrong about this.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:25.720]   They talk about the next generation of car play and showed a screen that as far as I
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:31.600]   know is only available in one high-end auto, the Mercedes EQS, that goes all the way across
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:37.200]   and by the way, there's no Mercedes branding or Ford or any other car company.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.920]   It's all Apple.
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.000]   As if they're telling the car companies, let us design the UI.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.720]   I thought very interesting.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:52.200]   I wonder if I wonder how much of that is a really rigged sample because boy, instrumentation,
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]   this is not even rigged.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200]   This is a drawing.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200]   I mean, I know.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:58.880]   But I mean that I want you're absolutely right.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:03.880]   But the thing is, there have been studies based on how many people have died because
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.840]   a switch was put in the wrong place or because it's the wrong color or because it looks like
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.400]   it's set, but it's not set.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:15.240]   This is not something I can change my watch face and my Android watch is something stupid
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.320]   and it doesn't really matter.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.400]   But if you let someone rearrange their console so that a really, really important piece of
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:27.200]   data just isn't there when they absolutely need it, that's a really, really bad thing.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.480]   And it's interesting.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:33.760]   And also, I wonder how many designers, if you thought that Johnny Ive and Apple designers
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.240]   were obsessive, think about the designers of a luxury brand car.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.960]   Are they going to be happy handing over the user interface design to the else?
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.480]   That's why I think it's really about Project Titan.
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.640]   That's why I really think.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.320]   It says this next generation of car plays the ultimate iPhone experience for the car.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.720]   It provides content for all the drivers screens, all of them, by the way, where your speedometer
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:00.240]   would be everything, including the instrument cluster, ensuring a cohesive design experience
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:05.440]   that's the very best of your car and your iPhone vehicle functions like a radio and
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.720]   temperature, vehicle functions like radio and temperature controls are handled right
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:15.000]   from car play, personalization options ranging from widgets to selecting a curated gauge cluster
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.400]   design, make it unique to the driver.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:20.360]   I have to think this is really intended for self driving cars.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.680]   I think this is, this is Apple saying, yeah, you see that ugly thing.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.960]   Is it your car manufacturers foisting on you?
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:29.960]   You could have this.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.040]   And we noticed that there's still not, how many editions of WatchOS later, they're still
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.840]   not allowing you to create your own watch faces, but they are coming up with their own curated
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.320]   designs on a regular basis.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.920]   So maybe this is part of that.
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.920]   Same philosophy.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.080]   I mean, we know Apple's working on a car.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.080]   The only thing I could think of is this is intended for an Apple car.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:52.360]   Well, I mean, I think that also, I mean, they did say that we're going to start seeing some
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.000]   of these at least in the, in the not too distant future.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.640]   So I mean, they, you know, not well, we're going to announce late 2023.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.760]   They're going to announce which vehicles.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:02.760]   Right.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.520]   For, I, for instance, I have car play on my Ford Machi, which I love.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:14.480]   And there are some components from car play showing up on the driver's screen, but most
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.200]   of the driver's screen is owned by Ford.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.880]   I don't see Ford ever giving that up.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.440]   I think the real danger for the car manufacturers is in each class.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:30.160]   Let's like, if we break up these cars into, let's say five classes in each class where
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.200]   there's not a lot of difference between the cars, not a lot of differentiating factors.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.200]   This could be a differentiating factor.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.080]   I know that I would never buy a car that didn't have car plaques at this point.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:40.080]   That's why I didn't buy a Tesla.
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.600]   And I put it when it first came out.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.080]   But I, but I would never buy one now.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.280]   And so the issue is is that if I had five cars in the same class that I was looking at and
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:55.440]   only one head, this new Apple interface, I would buy it.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:00.080]   Like the other, you know, and so, so I think that if they don't have to turn the whole
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:03.600]   industry, they just have to divide it.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.760]   And then, and then a lot and create a reel because it's really hard for cars to differentiate
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.160]   themselves from each other.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:12.720]   And so for the ones that don't want to play, you just get the other ones and you, you know,
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720]   beat them with it.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.680]   And so that's, you know, that's, that's the, so I think that that might be more of what
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:23.120]   Apple is, you know, going to try to do at least and move things forward is just get,
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.960]   you know, cut those classes into bits and pieces and then, you know, show enough.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:32.200]   And if they show high sales, I mean, and when I say high sales, a punch of one or two
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.280]   percent is worth billions.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.280]   Right.
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:35.480]   You know, just one or two percent more.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.000]   I think consumers may also say an Apple kind of hinted at this.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.080]   I don't trust BMW with my data.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.520]   I trust Apple with my data.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.880]   And that's going to be a differentiator as well going down the road.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.960]   Well, there's a BMW still going to get your data.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:53.600]   They're just going to let there is no Apple is very restrictive.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:54.960]   No, Apple is very restrictive.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:57.200]   If you're, you know, Apple automotive.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:04.160]   Are you, I, okay, I, I have, I have trouble, I have trouble believing that a company would
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.600]   sign on for something like that, given how valuable that data is.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:08.600]   Oh, I agree.
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:12.520]   And that's why Apple wants to put pressure on your car company.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:18.240]   And again, again, we have to remember that Verizon Verizon laughed Apple out of the, uh,
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.960]   out of the room when they, when they offered the, when they said that what they wanted
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.680]   for the iPhone and it was probably the most expensive thing Verizon ever did.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.440]   You know, so well, they got, they got their money back.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.800]   I mean, that's, I'm just, I'm just saying that I'm just saying, yeah, well, they're
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:33.800]   still selling.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:38.360]   They still, they still reap the, the iPhone, but answer what they, what they lost was this
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:41.640]   is, I'm, I'll, I'll prevent this from becoming a total distraction.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:47.660]   So they basically gave AT&T the ability to, to lift themselves into Verizon's orbit as
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:53.840]   far as, as far as your, and they, and the thing is, is that I, I dumped Verizon for AT&T
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.680]   when the iPhone came out and I'm still using AT&T and I spend a lot of money with AT&T.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.680]   It's the whole family.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:04.320]   I just, you think I was, it's, you know, I just don't, I just, I just don't think that,
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:09.480]   that car play is going to be doing a whole lot that Android, Android auto can't match.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:15.220]   I'm also skeptical that there will be a lot of – it looks great for a solution for luxury
[01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:20.480]   cars, but how about the cars that most people are going to be buying, they're just going
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:25.280]   to have a very simple center console, and maybe Dash and Cuth cluster to fill out.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:31.640]   So I am yet to be convinced that this is going to be a trump card for Apple.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:37.460]   It's nice, but it's – as Alex – excuse me, as Leo said – it's a piece of art
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:41.080]   at this point, and we're still trying to figure out exactly it's – it's nice to
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.940]   see that Apple is trying to make some fine ways to monetize all their research on the
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:45.940]   car.
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:49.460]   Most of the news that we're getting out of that project is another really critical
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:54.500]   person decided to bail and start working for another car company, or just to – as soon
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:59:00.020]   as their stock options paid out, they decided to come to leave, which is not something that
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:05.500]   someone who is looking forward to being on a stage, being introduced by Tim Cook and
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:09.340]   showing off the actual product that is actually shipping.
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:11.940]   If they see that happening the next couple years, they're probably not going to stick
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:12.940]   around.
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:16.460]   They like to ship products, so it's – maybe they're looking for ways to monetize all
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:19.020]   the research they've been doing up to this point.
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:23.900]   Mac OS 10 or 11 – is it 13 now?
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:24.900]   Ventura.
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:27.820]   Mac OS 13, Ventura.
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.420]   As all the stuff we just talked about, basically.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:33.740]   That's what's really interesting.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:38.660]   I mean, honestly, if you want to look at the overall of what we heard yesterday, everything
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:44.140]   they said really for the first time ever kind of applied to all their operating systems,
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.140]   to some degree.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:47.380]   They're all designed to work together.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:52.780]   Stage manager comes to both iOS – iPad OS, I should say – and Mac OS.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:58.500]   The collaborative features and messages go all across the board, continuity and handoff,
[01:59:58.500 --> 01:59:59.500]   across the board.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:03.700]   We're really seeing – this is really a strong ecosystem play from Apple.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:08.020]   Oh, but Leo, you can't forget that Clock is now on macOS.
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:12.020]   And now – it was a trade.
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.220]   iPad OS traded weather.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.220]   There you go.
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:16.660]   It traded for weather.
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:20.860]   It gave Mac OS, Clock OS, and an app to be named later.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:21.860]   And I think everybody's very happy.
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:24.500]   Next thing's going to be demanding, graphing calculator.
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.500]   Where does it end, Leo?
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.700]   Yeah, there are a few apps that we have not yet parted over.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:35.140]   I think really a lot of this is just Apple showing off the commonality of the platform
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.140]   now.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.700]   Oh, it is notable that – Oh, you got this.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:41.100]   Please, go ahead.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:47.660]   This Ventura does drop a lot of Macs, mostly Intel Macs, but a lot of Macs that people might
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.540]   have bought as early as like two years ago, three years ago, are not going to be compatible.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:52.980]   That doesn't mean that they're dead.
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:56.620]   That doesn't mean that the support is dead because the version of the OS that are running
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:58.620]   right now is very, very nice.
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:05.300]   But I think that some people who bought Macs in like 2019 might feel like their noses
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.700]   are got pushed out of joint by this.
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:15.660]   IMAX 2017 and later, IMAX Pro 2017 and later MacBook Air 2018 and later MacBook Pro 2017
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:16.660]   and later.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.500]   At least they didn't say you have to have an M1.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.780]   Mac Pro 2019 and later Mac Studio.
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.500]   Mac Mini 2018 and later.
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:23.500]   That's what I told 19 and later.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:24.500]   Yeah, next year.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:25.500]   Definitely.
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:28.140]   You don't buy into the Mac OS expecting a lot of backwards compatibility.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.740]   I mean, it's still going back five years.
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:30.740]   Yeah.
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:31.740]   I think that's what I'm doing.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:37.020]   I'm pretty excited about Handoff coming to Handoff for FaceTime coming to the Mac.
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:38.260]   Yeah, that's big.
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:42.180]   Only because my mom never answers on the right device.
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.460]   I have to hang up and say, "Don't answer and I'm going to call you back now.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:50.580]   Answer only on the iPad, but now she'll just be able to swoop it over to the...".
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:55.380]   You also like the fact that they have that QuickNote feature is now coming to the iPhone
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:56.380]   as well.
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:00.540]   You're on the iPad and Mac OS where you drag up from the right hand corner.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.740]   That makes notes just getting better and better and better.
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:10.300]   I think that the real challenge is really dealing with the fact for all the other competitors
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:16.140]   is Apple just keeps tying these ecosystems together and no one else really has that ecosystem
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.860]   that they can tie all the pieces of hardware and all the different things that you're doing
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:20.860]   back together.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:24.420]   I've kind of wandered off from the AirPods ecosystem.
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:27.820]   I don't use them as much in a day-to-day basis.
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:30.740]   It's back to Bluetooth.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:33.380]   You're just kind of like, "Okay."
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.060]   They were big on gaming as well.
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:38.220]   We didn't really mention that at all because I think we're all a little bit skeptical.
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:39.220]   Gaming on the desktop.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.220]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:41.220]   Yeah, they were big on that.
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:46.620]   They showed that very popular Resident Evil Village game that you can play right now on
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.740]   PS5 and Xbox, whichever console.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:55.940]   But it's coming to the Mac soon and then they also showed No Man's Sky on the platform as
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:56.940]   well.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.540]   I think that they are really trying to say, "Hey, hey, hey."
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:07.260]   In fact, one of the first sessions available for folks today was all about bringing the
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:11.500]   support for Unity games to Apple.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:17.220]   They had all sorts of stuff about how in Unity you can add these little plug-ins that Apple
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:22.260]   has that will allow you to basically make it a little bit easier for those Unity games
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:23.260]   to come.
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:30.860]   Did you know, Leo, that in this next version of Mac OS, you can create Linux Virtual Machines?
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.860]   What?
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:34.140]   I thought about you when I read that.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.260]   Oh, it might be nice.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.580]   They didn't mention Unity on stage.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:40.540]   They mentioned Metal.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:46.780]   Alex is Metal enough to bring AAA gaming to the Mac?
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:48.820]   I don't think that's enough.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:53.020]   I think the problem is just not that as much of a culture for that on that side.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:56.940]   I think they have to figure out who's going to buy it that doesn't already own a console
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.940]   or doesn't already.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:02.700]   If you're really into the AAA gaming, you have a big PVPC or you have a console.
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:03.940]   I think that it's going to take a long time.
[02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:11.740]   I think that Apple has to use an arcade, really has to fund some apps that really push
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:14.460]   the outer envelope of what the hardware can do.
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.900]   That's the advantage that they have.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:18.780]   They're actually directly funding these games.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:22.860]   They can actually go, "Okay, we really want to see you push the outer envelope of that
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:24.860]   process or build games like that."
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:27.980]   I think there's a lot of places they could do that.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:31.620]   I think that what would be really interesting is to build something that could be played
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:38.740]   on the phone and scale to the Mac Pro and just give you more detail and more things to
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:39.740]   enjoy.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:42.860]   I don't think anybody's done that I've seen very well.
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:46.300]   I think there's people who have tried it, but I think that Apple is uniquely capable
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:47.500]   of doing that.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.100]   We didn't really get to watch OS.
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:54.100]   We'll maybe save that for next week, but very clear that Apple says, "Now, the watch
[02:04:54.100 --> 02:05:00.180]   is about health and a lot of new health features on watch OS that are going to make it more
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:03.820]   and more desirable to runners and others."
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:04.820]   Sleep stages.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:05.820]   Sleep stages.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:08.660]   They have med timers and med reminders.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:11.460]   They've just added a huge amount of health features.
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:15.340]   This is now the health device.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.380]   They're just doubling down on that.
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:23.860]   If you go to the new features page for the Mac, for the iPad, for the iPhone, it's just
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:30.340]   lots and lots of very gated topics and different kinds of features and enhancements.
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:34.260]   You could almost wear out your fingers scrolling down on the watch OS before you get to the
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:35.260]   first thing.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:37.260]   That's nothing to do with health.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.980]   That's going to be alternative watch faces.
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:42.660]   All right, let's take a break.
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.180]   Pics of the week.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:46.940]   Still to come as we continue Mac break weekly.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:49.980]   Thank you, Micah, for coming in and filling in for Renee Ritchie.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:54.460]   It's great to have you on, especially as you already got up early this morning to do
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.900]   iOS today with Rosemary Orchard.
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:59.940]   I'll be back on Thursday for Tech News Weekly.
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:03.540]   Watch iOS today if you want a deeper dive right into iOS.
[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:04.540]   Yes, absolutely.
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:05.540]   It's interesting.
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:06.540]   Lots of stuff.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:09.500]   I bet you talked a little bit about HomeKit.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:11.700]   I didn't because there wasn't enough.
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.100]   There wasn't enough disgust.
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.060]   A little bit disappointing, frankly.
[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:16.060]   Yes.
[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:23.660]   But that's appropriate because basically that's what home automation is, a little bit disappointing.
[02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:31.140]   Alex Lindsay, Office Hours.global and onino.media and the Inaco, WGBH Boston, we will have your
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:34.660]   Pics of the Week prepare.
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:38.180]   This word from our sponsor, CashFly.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.220]   Our show is brought to you by CashFly.
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:45.420]   Not just a sponsorship, but literally when you download it, when you watch it, you're
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:48.580]   watching from a CashFly server near you.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:49.900]   That's why I love CashFly.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.580]   It's our content delivery network, our CDN.
[02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:57.940]   With the best throughput, the best global reach 50 locations around the globe.
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:02.380]   Whenever you're watching our shows or listening to our shows, you're getting the content from
[02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:05.180]   a server close to you geographically.
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.620]   That's why so many people use CashFly.
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:10.220]   Not just for content delivery, but for gaming.
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:15.660]   And now for ultra low latency, video streaming.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:21.420]   With sub one second latency, you can go live in hours, ditch that unreliable WebRTC solution
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:27.460]   for their WebSocket, live video workflow, scales to millions of users.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:35.300]   Take an amazing encoding platform.
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:39.340]   It's well worth taking a look at if you're looking at video streaming.
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:44.940]   If you're looking at a cash fly now has something called storage optimization, which
[02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:48.660]   actually increases your cash ratio to 100%.
[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:51.540]   It takes the load off your origin servers, reduces your S3 bills.
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:54.340]   We've been kind of using this since we started with CashFly.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:59.340]   They very kindly allowed us to store our content on CashFly servers, which means they're
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:01.860]   available in the cash instantly.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:07.900]   We no longer have any of that expensive of transitioning our content from our origin servers
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.820]   to CashFly.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:10.820]   Just fantastic.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:11.820]   You want to take a look at that.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:14.380]   They call it SOS storage optimization system.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:18.980]   Of course with CashFly's elite managed packages, you get VIP treatment, the kind of treatment
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:22.500]   we get 24/7 support response times in less than an hour.
[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:25.820]   Most cases, if there's an issue, they'll know about it and they'll be working to fix it
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:28.460]   before your team is even called.
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:34.660]   CashFly lightning fast gaming, faster downloads, zero lag, glitches or outages, mobile content
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:39.380]   optimization that offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.940]   So your site loads faster on any device.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:44.100]   Multi-CDN means redundancy and failover.
[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:48.660]   In fact, CashFly's had 100% availability over the last 12 months.
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:55.220]   100%, they're 10 times faster than traditional methods on 6 continents, 30% faster than other
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:59.860]   major CDNs with a 98% cash hit ratio.
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.420]   It's CashFly.
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:04.020]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:05.420]   Interested?
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:08.500]   Let me recommend you go to cashfly.com.
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:12.660]   Best of all, 24/7, 365 day a year priority support.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.460]   So they'll always be there when you need them.
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:19.100]   Cashfly.com and if you've got video, if you're streaming, you definitely want to look at
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:21.060]   their ultra low latency streaming.
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:23.700]   CashFly, thank you, CashFly.
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:28.980]   You're a lifesaver and have been for more than 10 years on our network.
[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:30.820]   Mike Osargan, I'm going to let you kick things off.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:32.940]   Our guest of honor today.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:33.940]   All right.
[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:34.940]   Yeah.
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:39.580]   I'm talking about an app called Good Day World and this is an app.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:40.580]   Good day.
[02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:46.860]   This is a really cool app for folks who are curious about the UI of iOS.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:53.180]   So this app was actually created entirely by a person who is a product designer, first
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:56.460]   and foremost, developer, not so much.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:57.860]   Like that's how he describes himself.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:03.140]   So even though he is a product designer and thinks about things in that way, he wanted
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:05.940]   to talk about the different ways that the system works.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:10.220]   So the guy's name is Clarko and it starts out with some fun text and everything that
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:14.500]   you can read about and talking about should designers actually do coding.
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:16.420]   But it goes on from there.
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:21.380]   It shows off a lot of the fun UI features that are available that you might not even
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:22.380]   know about.
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:29.060]   So this first little kind of widget or little toolkit that's here is one for different places
[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:32.700]   around Cupertino that are tasty places to eat.
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:35.820]   So you can swipe between these different places and kind of learn about them if you're in
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:37.180]   the area.
[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:43.620]   The next one is a little streaming media player that will play music throughout the day depending
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:44.820]   on what day it is.
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:47.140]   So each day it comes up with a new thing.
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:49.540]   But this is where things get fun.
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:52.780]   You can learn about different ways to actually do toggles.
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:59.100]   So essentially this product designer was trying to see how customizable SwiftUI is while also
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:00.300]   getting to play around with it.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:04.660]   So the first thing is I can go through and tap on all of these toggles and play around
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:05.660]   with them.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:09.820]   So you can see these customizations that you can do to make your code as customizable as
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:11.020]   you want and get some idea.
[02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:14.460]   And I should also mention there are some haptic feedback things happening as well.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:16.380]   Also for these switches.
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:20.700]   And the product designer is super clever in writing as well.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.220]   So as you read through these you kind of have a chuckle as you're learning about them.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:25.380]   Different checkboxes.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:28.860]   And then my favorite segment is called Keyed Up.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:33.020]   And here I didn't realize there were so many different ways to do this.
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:39.100]   Here I didn't realize there were so many different kinds of keyboards that iOS can serve you
[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:40.900]   depending on what you're doing.
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:44.340]   And what's cool is you can tap on each of these keyboards and actually bring them up
[02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:45.340]   from the bottom.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:48.380]   There's the default model, the ASCII capable model.
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:52.420]   But even ones like the Twitter variant which you can see in the bottom right there's the
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:56.500]   at sign and the octo-thorp or the pound sign depending on how you choose to describe it.
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:59.500]   I guess also the hashtag is another way.
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:03.180]   And then there's versions like the email address form.
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:07.140]   So whenever you tap into an email form this is the keyboard that pops up, the URL keyboard
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:10.140]   form and so on and so forth.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:14.100]   And then this section which talks about autocorrect.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:18.460]   There's this part here where you're meant to type in the text below that says the five
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:22.980]   boxing wizards jump quickly, right?
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:24.860]   And obviously I'm not doing a very good job typing.
[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:26.140]   That has autocorrect built in.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:31.100]   But the one underneath is without autocorrect and you're meant to type it in and see kind
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:37.100]   of how hard it can be to actually type that out.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:42.420]   And then it goes on to all caps typing, typing with each word capitalized and then even one
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:45.700]   that has the SpongeBob case which is where there are ones that are up and down.
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:48.860]   But that one is not actually built into the system.
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:56.980]   The developers continuously updating these so that you can check out the other discoveries
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:00.140]   that they've made as they are playing around in the system.
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:05.260]   And I just think it's a really delightful little app that is kind of a quick look at
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.860]   some of the built in features of SwiftUI.
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:13.740]   And also the developers started building it in playgrounds on an iPad.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:15.580]   So I think that's a pretty cool thing as well.
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:19.340]   Yeah, a chance to see all the controls and stuff built into SwiftUI.
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.740]   Good day world from Clacko.
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:24.340]   Yeah, now LLC, it's free.
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:25.340]   Yep, absolutely.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:29.340]   Does it give you code samples or is it just to look at it?
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:33.780]   Yeah, it's just for looking just to see what all the interface design patterns.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:36.500]   Because these are things that you can just drag and drop essentially.
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:37.500]   There's not really.
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:38.500]   Right.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:39.500]   Yeah.
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:44.220]   So kind of a fun thing if you're curious about the inner workings and what's possible just
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:48.700]   even on the surface of SwiftUI, this is a great app for that.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.020]   It's like the Fisher-Frank's busy busy box for babies.
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:52.020]   It is a busy box.
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:53.020]   A dial and a button.
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:55.460]   Yeah, it's a fidget cube.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.460]   Yeah.
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.340]   Andy, you're not going to go big other week.
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:02.220]   Mine is a kind of a combined pick and tip.
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:10.060]   I've gradually become convinced that it is okay to not spend a fortune on a monitor arm.
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:13.220]   The one that I've been using for the past 10 years is an Ergo Tron.
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:15.340]   It's made by a proper company.
[02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:18.860]   It costs like hundreds of dollars.
[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:25.580]   But I've just particularly given how much time I'm using with my MacBook connected to
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:29.380]   an external screen and also connected to an iPad at the same time.
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.220]   I decided that, okay, I need a dual arm thing.
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:35.020]   And I was like, geez, I really want to spend $350 for the Ergo Tron.
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:37.580]   One of those are the ones that was recommended by Wearcutter.
[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:42.500]   But it's especially tempting given that if you go on Amazon, you will find just dozens
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:47.260]   of like kind of no name monitor arms that cost like 50 bucks.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:51.620]   So even like the dual monitor, dual arm ones cost like 60 or 70.
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:54.380]   So I've been tracking prices for a while.
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:57.420]   I found one that I kind of liked and it went on sale for 90 bucks.
[02:14:57.420 --> 02:14:58.420]   I bought it.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:04.900]   I was not specifically recommending this one, but this happens to be the Ergir ERgir ERgir
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:07.020]   dual monitor stand.
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:08.660]   List price 149 currently.
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:09.660]   It's 110.
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:10.940]   I bought it at 89.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.780]   I use, as usual, I was using camel, camel, camel to track prices.
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:17.220]   And so I know that is legitimately a super low price.
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:18.380]   So I bought it.
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:19.380]   So I'm using it right now.
[02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:22.460]   And I have to say that I found nothing to complain about.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460]   It's all metal parts.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:27.940]   It's not like it's like all plastic and it's like everything sagging after the after one
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:28.940]   day.
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:33.700]   The difference between this and my Ergir Tron is that it's set up was definitely more complicated.
[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:35.420]   There was a lot more assembly to be done.
[02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:39.540]   I was kind of anticipating that would be like the Ergir Tron where you basically snap a
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:41.940]   few things together, screw it onto my desk and I'm good.
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.580]   No, it did take a little while.
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:47.180]   The instructions were okay, but not great, but not hard to follow.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:51.020]   The other thing is that I think that if I paid an extra two or three hundred dollars
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:57.380]   for the setup, the arms would be a lot more like zero gravity than they actually are.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:02.300]   What I like about my Ergir Tron is that I can truly just hold the bottom of my of the
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:06.060]   screen with a few fingers and just tilt and move it exactly where I want it to go.
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:07.300]   And it stays there.
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:09.860]   These arms are a little stiffer.
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:14.500]   They can certainly be adjusted exactly the same way as I do in my three hundred four
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:15.780]   hundred dollar arm.
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:20.660]   But the difference is that I kind of have to use both arms, both hands to do it and put
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:21.660]   it where I wanted to go.
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:23.420]   Then it will stay where it wants to go.
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:27.340]   It's just it takes a little it's more difficult I think to dial it in.
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:32.220]   It uses gas cylinders just like the expensive one to decide like to offset the weight of
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:33.780]   whatever it is you've got connected to it.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:36.900]   I've got a 24 inch Dell monitor on one.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:40.140]   I've got my MacBook Pro on a tray on the other one.
[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:45.580]   So if I spent more time fiddling with that adjustment to counteract the weight precisely
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:48.420]   as opposed to roughly maybe it would be better.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:51.620]   But then again it's not as though I'm always like adjusting these things a hundred ways
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:52.620]   anyway.
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:57.820]   In this particular application I'm happy to have saved two hundred dollars with a very
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:00.340]   small amount of inconvenience that I think was worth it.
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:04.700]   So basically what I'm saying is that if you have been in the same position that I've been
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:09.940]   in where you seem you don't have like three or four hundred dollars to spend on again
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:15.620]   a really good name brand recommended by wire cutter monitor arm.
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:20.100]   But you don't want to buy junk that will wake you up in the middle of the night in the
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:23.860]   other room because you've got five thousand dollars worth of screens and computers.
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:27.980]   They're just flung across the robot by a by a broken spring.
[02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:30.100]   I think it's I think it's a it's a good thing to try.
[02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:31.100]   It's a good thing to test.
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:34.060]   I bought this and I'm very very happy with it so far.
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:35.060]   Nice.
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:36.060]   Nice.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:39.500]   That's kind of one of my dreams to get my monitors up on arms.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:40.500]   Yeah.
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.980]   I have a good thing to do there not.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:44.460]   I meant to ask Alex.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:48.980]   Well, you had a visa mount recommendation for an iPad Pro that I lost.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:49.980]   Yes.
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:50.980]   It's Vivo.
[02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:54.140]   I don't know if I can reach it.
[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:55.140]   There it is.
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.140]   It's kind of in there.
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:57.140]   And it's on an arm too.
[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:58.140]   All my monitors are on arms.
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:03.380]   I use I do something similar to Andy is that I have I have like five monitors that are
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:05.940]   on arms and then I have a wackum tablet here.
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:10.820]   That's what I use for my my wackum tablets connected to it via visa mount.
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:15.500]   And I use two of these little Vivo holders to grab onto the iPad and grab onto a wackum
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:16.500]   tablet.
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:21.100]   They're all on who want to, which is another inexpensive set of arms and they make ones
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:25.980]   with a center pole as well as ones that mount on the base and they're similar to price.
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.020]   They were from 60 to 120 bucks.
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:32.340]   You know, the the higher ones that I've used are the monitors in motion, which are magical.
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.820]   Like you just grab something and move it and it goes where it wants the Amazon ones are
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:42.300]   about 280 and my company my previous company, Pixel or, you know, probably bought 20 of
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:43.860]   them, 30 of them.
[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:49.300]   But but these ones are they are, as Andy said, a little stiffer than the other ones are.
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:54.060]   They're not quite as magical as placing things, but they're a lot cheaper.
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:56.020]   These are the ones I bought with him.
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:59.780]   And especially if you're if your goal is I want arms on all the things, not just on
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:03.620]   that one special screen that I do most of my work on, which which which turned into my
[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:04.620]   goal.
[02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:05.620]   I still have this.
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:09.180]   I still have it on the us on a small table that I use just for podcasting.
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:14.380]   But as soon as I finished, like fixing up that corner of the office with a big work table,
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:16.740]   that's going to be like a four screen setup.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:22.140]   And that's that's the difference between 2021 and 2022 that no, I definitely want like
[02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:29.020]   multiple like iPads on visa mounts now and on arms because they are that useful.
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.540]   Alex, what's your pick this week?
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:34.340]   So I think another person office hours, Tom Ferguson.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:40.300]   And again, I would the some of the other stuff I was suggested by him.
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:44.820]   This is the aftershocks, which I just never thought I'd buy.
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:48.620]   And aftershocks, it's called open calm and it's got a wave.
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.940]   It's got a little boom.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.580]   It's got a little boom mic on it.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:55.980]   So this is bone conducting, which, you know, I experiment bone conducting early on.
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:59.620]   And I was like, I don't think this is really my thing.
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:02.900]   What the reason I got these is that a lot of times we're doing things where we need
[02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:05.220]   comms and I need to be able to hear a show.
[02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:10.420]   So I need in years in my years and then I can put these over top like this and I can
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:15.500]   take them on and off and I'm listening to my comms, you know, like so I can talk to someone
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:20.580]   through comms and, you know, and I can pull this down and and and and there I have, you
[02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:23.740]   know, that on top of it so I can hear both shows at the same time without trying to mix
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:24.980]   them together.
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:27.380]   And so, so that's the reason I bought it.
[02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:33.580]   But what happened is is that I got a lot of comments on on the wrong side on how clear
[02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:38.180]   the audio is and how good how good the noise reduction was.
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:42.020]   And so things that I couldn't do with my AirPods, like wash dishes, I'm talking to one of my
[02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:43.860]   producers, I wouldn't do it for a client.
[02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:46.340]   But like if I'm talking about something, we just want to talk for a little bit, I might
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:49.620]   want to clean something up or move something around it before it was always like, well,
[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:51.020]   you're making a lot of noise.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:52.540]   That one that all went away.
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:57.700]   And so so having that as something I can have internal calls with and not have it be problematic
[02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:01.580]   for me to move around a little bit was was really great.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.500]   You know, it's it's pretty clear.
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:04.500]   It's more better.
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:09.420]   It's not it's not a replacement for in years, but it's way better than I expected.
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:11.500]   And and it works really well.
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:13.500]   And so and it's really it's comfortable to wear.
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.860]   I often will wear it for hours in a row.
[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:20.340]   And it is, yeah.
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:22.340]   So that's they were a sponsor for a long time.
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:26.700]   But I've been using aftershucks ever since for conferences, because yeah, but I know
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:27.700]   they had a boom mic.
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.260]   Yeah, they didn't get my back.
[02:21:29.260 --> 02:21:31.260]   That's a boom mic makes a huge difference.
[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:36.020]   Like is just closer turns out, you know, you cut the distance between the the mic and the
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:38.060]   and the mouth and it makes a big difference.
[02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:42.020]   So yeah, it's the kind of because you're not in your ears, you could still do everything.
[02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:43.420]   You can still everything that's going on.
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:47.060]   And it's I really noticed how much I'm much I it's much more comfortable.
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.140]   I'm much more aware of my surroundings.
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:50.140]   Yeah.
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:53.860]   And I've been in a lot of those conversations and so it's it I was very surprised that I
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:54.860]   that I liked it.
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:58.660]   But it's this should be the the number one pick for Hollywood agents everywhere.
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:00.220]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:02.260]   I mean, really seriously.
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:03.260]   Nice.
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.260]   Very good.
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:09.540]   Alex, I wanted to ask you before we wrap today about John Foster because he passed away.
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:10.540]   Good friend of the pixel core.
[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:11.980]   He came up with a name pixel core.
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:14.140]   He did he did he came up with a name pixel core.
[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:15.140]   So the the name.
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:16.140]   Yeah.
[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:20.100]   So John Foster was incredible guy, you know, and and he.
[02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:24.900]   And when we were just getting started and I don't remember, I think we just started talking
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:28.740]   to each other because we're at user groups together, you know, and he would sometimes
[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:29.740]   show stuff off.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:36.780]   And so he was really integral, especially in the early years of really a lot of the thought
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:42.180]   process, like he was the person that I that I threw ideas against the wall with, you know,
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:47.820]   and on all the early stuff that now effects pixel core effects, office hours, effects,
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:50.220]   you know, a lot of things are just thinking through that process.
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:53.580]   And again, he when we were talking about what is this thing that we're creating, he's
[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:56.540]   like, well, it's kind of like Marine Corps.
[02:22:56.540 --> 02:22:57.940]   It's got that kind of structure to it.
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:22:59.180]   And but it's with pixels.
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:01.780]   And so so that was, you know, and he's like score.
[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:04.060]   And that was the and so he really came up with that.
[02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:09.780]   And so anyway, so it's a incredible guy and, you know, had some health issues.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:12.020]   And so he he did pass last week.
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:15.420]   Yeah, sad, really, really amazing, amazing person.
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:19.540]   He hosted or not hosted was a regular on this weekend media, I think, right?
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:20.700]   And he was in the early days.
[02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:26.140]   He was definitely one of the one of the regulars on it and just and just knew, you
[02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:31.020]   know, he had a whole he had been in really in the dot, you know, boom, during the 90s
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:37.180]   and really just deep into interactive design and building things and just an incredible
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:38.180]   thinker.
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:42.540]   And so it was really great to have him as part of some of the early shows as well as,
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:47.100]   you know, as well as just just someone that was just a great friend that was able to
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.260]   help me synthesize a lot of a lot of ideas.
[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.260]   Yeah.
[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:53.860]   And part of early early Mac breaks as well.
[02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:54.860]   Yeah.
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:56.860]   Remember John well.
[02:23:56.860 --> 02:23:57.860]   Yeah.
[02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:04.100]   Well, sorry to sorry to lose another great guy, but we'll miss him.
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:05.100]   Thank you.
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:06.580]   A reminder just to stay in touch with folks.
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:07.580]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:09.140]   I realized I hadn't seen him in a couple of years.
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:10.140]   Yeah, me too.
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.140]   All the stuff.
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:12.140]   Yeah.
[02:24:12.140 --> 02:24:15.260]   And then when I found out I was, you know, surprised.
[02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:17.820]   So yeah, because he was young.
[02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:18.820]   All right.
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:20.660]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:21.660]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.660]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:24.460]   No, thank you, Micah.
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:25.460]   Hold on.
[02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:27.460]   Let me say sorry.
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:28.460]   Sorry.
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:29.460]   Sorry.
[02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.460]   It's not Renee.
[02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:31.460]   How I'm Renee.
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:34.580]   Micah will be back to day after tomorrow for Tech News Weekly.
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:36.660]   I imagine you'll be doing a little more Apple stuff.
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.540]   And of course, next Tuesday, you got to watch iOS today with Rosemary Orchard.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:41.540]   That's a great show.
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:42.540]   You two are fantastic.
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:43.540]   And us on Saturday.
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:44.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:45.540]   I forgot.
[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.820]   He also joins me on the Tech Guy every Saturday.
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:51.940]   He's going to solo while I'm on the Twit Cruise.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:54.820]   July 16th, 2030 is going to be on the host.
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:57.660]   He's going to be the Tech Guy.
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:00.900]   So we're slapping him around, getting him ready for his appearance.
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:02.420]   It's going to be fun.
[02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:03.420]   I can't wait.
[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:04.420]   Yeah, it should be fun.
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:05.940]   Yeah, I'm leaving him good hands.
[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:07.740]   Very good hands.
[02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:08.740]   Thank you, Andy Naka.
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:11.140]   When are you going to be on GBH, your radio show?
[02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:18.460]   I'm off GBH this week, but I'm on WGN Radio in Chicago on Thursday 9.45 AM locally talking
[02:25:18.460 --> 02:25:21.460]   about WWC and other sundry topics.
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:22.700]   WGN Grade Station.
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:25.380]   WGN Radio dot com to stream it live or later.
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:26.380]   What is it?
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:28.020]   Somebody's show or just with the news people?
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:30.020]   Oh, it is.
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:36.020]   Oh, I can't remember because I do the morning show every couple of months off.
[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:37.020]   But I'm afraid.
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:38.020]   But I'm fine.
[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:40.620]   45 AM on a bit of a talk which time.
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:41.620]   Yeah.
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:42.620]   Oh, yeah.
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:44.180]   No, they're great to work with.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:48.580]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, his business, his day job, 090 dot media.
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:55.860]   If you want to hire him to consult or to support your stream or any of your big events, this
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:57.220]   is a great boy.
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:59.140]   You couldn't get better than this.
[02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:02.540]   And officehours.global is all day, all night.
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:05.100]   But the mornings are where you do the special stuff.
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.120]   What's coming up tomorrow morning?
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:08.700]   This week is all W.C.
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:09.700]   Oh, nice.
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:13.820]   So we talked, we had, of course, yesterday morning we talked about what we want to see.
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:19.220]   Then we talked, then we did the kind of the Mystery Science Theater version of the show
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:21.020]   when the show was going on.
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:24.500]   And then in the evening, we of course talked about it some more.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:30.580]   And then this morning we talked with developers talking about audio and video and what WWC
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:31.580]   affects there.
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:36.900]   Tomorrow we'll talk about 3D and AR and Thursday we'll kind of have a catch all of the things
[02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:38.480]   that the people saw.
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:40.200]   And then Friday we'll actually talk about what happened.
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:41.480]   Like we like what we did.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:44.440]   So we have this odd thing where we look at things on the outside, then we look at the
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.440]   inside.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.600]   Like how did that coverage work?
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.760]   And we just finished NAMM, which is the big audio show last weekend where we covered
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.320]   it for three hours each day and wandered around and did some great interviews.
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:00.560]   And then we cover Cineguier this Saturday, which is another big show in LA.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.920]   And then, I'm speaking at info com remotely tomorrow.
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:05.920]   So it's busy.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:07.620]   It's busy, busy, busy week.
[02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:08.620]   Yeah.
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:09.620]   Office hours.
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:10.620]   Global.
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:11.700]   You can participate.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:15.820]   It's a zoom call or you can watch it after the fact.
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.620]   Does anybody know, do you know Micah?
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:21.020]   Is Serenity going to do her WWDC wrap ups?
[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:22.020]   She did do those.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:25.100]   Yeah, those kicked off yesterday night.
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:26.260]   I was trying to find it.
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:27.820]   Where is it?
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:33.060]   So I saw it in the developer app and I don't know if she posted it herself on Twitter.
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:34.460]   That might might have been why you didn't see it.
[02:27:34.460 --> 02:27:37.360]   But in the developer app, it was the last thing posted.
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:38.360]   Good.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:40.280]   Because that was a highlight last year.
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:41.280]   She does it as a Memoji.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:44.560]   Yeah, it's really fun.
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:45.560]   No hair, no makeup.
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:46.560]   Perfect setup.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:47.560]   It's easy.
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:50.360]   I've been tempted to do that myself.
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.360]   Awesome.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:52.360]   All right.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:59.440]   So if you follow her on Twitter, S-E-T-T-E-R-N, Serenity Caldwell's Twitter account, you'll
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:05.300]   be able to see the links to her wrap ups, which she last year did every day.
[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:10.560]   And I imagine that's what she's going to do this year as well, which is great.
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:12.720]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:19.140]   We do Mac break weekly of a Tuesday morning, around 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:24.260]   You can tune in and watch us live on the stream at live.twit.tv.
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:26.440]   There's actually audio and video there.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.560]   If you're watching live chat live at IRC.twit.tv, you can also, if you're a club twit member,
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.520]   join us in the Discord.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:37.000]   That is a great place to go.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.720]   Club twit, let me give you a little plug to club twit because it helps us out a lot.
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:47.080]   As you know, we face the winds of change here in the podcast industry.
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:50.400]   Seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions of all the shows.
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:51.400]   We figure you're paying us.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:52.800]   You don't need ads.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:55.440]   So get ad free versions of all the shows.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:58.600]   You also get access to the Discord, which is a really great community.
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:01.440]   We've got all sorts of things coming up, including Stacy's book club.
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:04.640]   I'm going to be participating in that because I'm reading the book and I love it.
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:12.480]   Stacy's book club is the 16th and it is at 9 AM Pacific and it's going to be Neil Stevenson's
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.520]   termination shock.
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:19.000]   There will be a fireside chat with all of our members, July 7th.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.960]   And then Alex is going to do a fireside chat or an ask me anything anyway, July 14th.
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:26.280]   Some of the events going on in our Discord.
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:31.280]   You also get the twit plus feed, which gives you a lot of stuff that doesn't make it into
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.640]   the podcasts, the cutting room floor things, bits and pieces.
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:39.520]   Plus shows that we don't put out as regular podcasts like the untitled Linux show that
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:41.440]   gives Fizz.
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.200]   That's how this weekend space started.
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:50.120]   Of course, once we had got it down and perfected, we released it as a podcast.
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:52.080]   That's another thing the club lets us do.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:54.040]   The dollars help us launch new shows.
[02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:57.480]   In fact, you're going to be happy to hear about a new show that's coming.
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:04.320]   We've been working on it pretty soon to first the club and then to a public consumption.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:07.640]   If you want to know more about club twit, twit.tv/club twit.
[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:13.280]   I should also mention that if you just wanted Mac break weekly without ads, we sell that
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:15.280]   on iTunes as well, $2.99 a month.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.800]   In fact, all the shows, there's ad-free versions.
[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:21.800]   If you just want one show for $2.99 a month, I think we're doing it on Spotify as well.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:23.760]   They offer that as well.
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.400]   So $2.99 for any single show.
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:28.720]   If you only listen to one show, if you listen to more than one show, it makes sense probably
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:31.480]   to join a club twit and get them all.
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:32.480]   Not Spotify.
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:33.480]   Thank you, Patrick.
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:35.560]   I'm not sure why not.
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:36.560]   They have that feature, Ben.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:41.880]   I think we were talking about it, but I'm not keeping up on what's going on.
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:42.880]   Obviously.
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:45.560]   Twit.tv/club twit.
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:47.280]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:50.480]   Back to work because break time is over.
[02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:51.480]   Bye-bye.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:55.600]   You are looking for a midweek update on the week's tech news.
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:58.120]   I got to tell you, you got to check out tech news weekly.
[02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:00.520]   See, it's all kind of built in there with the title.
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:04.440]   You get to learn about the news in tech that matters.
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:09.080]   Every Thursday, Jason Howell and I talk to the people making and breaking the tech news,
[02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:12.040]   get their insights and their interesting stories.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:15.720]   It's a great show to check out twit.tv/tnw.
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:27.920]   [music]
