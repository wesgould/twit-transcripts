[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.400]   Break Weekly and for that we've gathered together the usual stalwarts.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.600]   We've got Andy and Akko who's flying out for a speech. Where are you right now
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.860]   Andy? I'm still in Boston. I'm a temporary at world please don't tell them
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.260]   I'm just a commander or go still probably kick me out. I'm in the Apple's Club for
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.340]   the free Wi-Fi.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.620]   Hey Ensign and I go what are you doing in here? I know I know it's like you but it's I
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.660]   feel like this is this is like one of the few chances that I know I'm gonna be
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.420]   able to talk to real human beings for good two hours if I if I if I break my
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.500]   appointment here I'll lose the act. So I told him the strawberry ice cream was
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.260]   any Admiral's Club but he didn't believe me. That's a very poor Humphrey
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.340]   booger. Look who's here Alex Lenzay. I am. He is visiting us from Kilgolly. Yeah
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.980]   where are you actually from? Where am I actually from? I mean 35,000 most recently.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.460]   Yeah no no no no no no. You were you were just in Kilgolly. Last week. So we were doing
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.300]   Rwanda. So we did live streaming for the it's called transform Africa so it's
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.740]   basically tech leaders and actually seven heads of state so I have seven
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.740]   presidents and while all of the ministers and everything else talking
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.140]   about how technology is making a difference in Africa. That's really
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.020]   interesting. They were dealing with you know cyber all the stuff we talk about
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.860]   cyber security you know using it in agriculture health and how how it's
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.900]   being used in Africa and then also what's coming up next. So like Rwanda is
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.700]   rolling out LTE which is huge because they are behind in effect having now
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.340]   steady that starting the infrastructure that they are an in fact ahead because
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.860]   they didn't have the legacy stuff that we have to deal with for the countries
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.540]   that are willing to invest absolutely. So a country like Rwanda one of the
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.180]   go straight to LTE. Well but a lot of countries are not so a lot of the a lot
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.180]   of the countries so it's it's more expensive to roll out LTE from a
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.020]   hardware perspective than then edge and 3G and so on and so forth but it's a
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.700]   lot cheaper and you can support a lot more people with with it once it's rolled
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.780]   out and so a lot of the countries are still India and a lot of the other
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.180]   countries are still going hey we're doing 3G right what Rwanda did is they
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.340]   spent 140 million dollars with Korea and they're just rolling there their
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.140]   Rwanda has committed to providing LTE to 95% of the population in three years.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.420]   It's basically universal internet access. Yeah and and they have and they
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.420]   have the fiber backbone to do it. Wow. You know and so so they were showing
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.860]   that of course no one's on the network yet so they were doing LTE tests. Oh man
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.180]   105 megabits a second. You were you were we wanted to talk to you last week
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.100]   from Rwanda and it was kind of it was for one for one of a horseshoe the battle
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.860]   was lost because you had what was it? Oh yeah it was it was a bad with. Yeah but
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.180]   you had no way to do it use it. Yeah well what happened was so so I had a
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.740]   hundred megabit connection in Rwanda and so I was like this is gonna be great
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.300]   except the place that I had it it turned out there was this huge like
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.420]   dignitaries and everything else we're having dinner there. So so it was like
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.780]   you know it's the one place where I had the fiber drop I thought no one was
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.260]   gonna be there so I figured it's gonna be 10 at nine o'clock at night. You don't
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.540]   mind if I do a podcast. It's just out of my way. Well then I thought I said can I
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.300]   go into that little room and I was like yeah sure they told me that in the
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.180]   afternoon so I went around to the room and that was like where the buffet was.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.300]   No. You know and so so that I got it was it was it was sad because it was I had I
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.380]   had the connection I had the and it was anyway it was um well you're here now.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.700]   It was a band with superb here by the way. The band with is super realistic.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.660]   Very real. Yes. I would say more than 4k. I'm rendering well. Yeah exactly.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.700]   So hey look who's also here with his iPad Air Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.980]   Look here we can see it's like a mirror in reverse and upside down. That's very
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.620]   nice. It's amazing. It's fun in the iPad Air. It's very realistic.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.540]   I Renee. It's the finis lightest fastest iPad ever Leo again. How could it not be?
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.580]   Would you release something that were less than less fast less than iPad 3?
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.540]   They did. They did. The iPad 2. Which by the way apparently still selling
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.580]   pretty well which is very strange. Before we get to the iPad because I know
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.220]   you really want to get to the iPad. Did you get the picture of Andy setup yet
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.460]   chat on your email Andy sent it to you. All right before we get to that then let
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.020]   me show you this. A robot there. Look at this. This is how Andy this is how Andy
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.020]   rolls. He's looking straight into a corner but you never know it. He's a
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.380]   floating. It's awesome Andrew. I like the light on the back. The green Admiral
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.780]   Allowing is amazing. You know that they filled half of season of how I met
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:30.780]   your mother right in this exact. Here is a video of a rock paper scissors robot
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.300]   that you cannot beat. Do you know the reason you cannot beat it is it can tell
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.420]   what you're going to do. That's not fair. Take 60 milliseconds for you to form the
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.900]   thing that you're going to do with your fist and do it in but in 20 milliseconds
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.260]   it can sense it. It could tell ahead of time. You cannot beat it. It will beat you
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.340]   every time. Okay I just thought we'd start with something. That's not right.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.860]   Stop developing robots immediately. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to play
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.460]   the thumb wrestling with it. That's all I'm saying. Skynets coming kids. It's
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.380]   first rock paper scissors that's then the owner nuclear war. I'm telling you. Oh man.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.260]   It's it can literally it literally senses about what you're about to do. It's a
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.940]   cheap bot. Well you know in our defense that's a pretty crap scissors it's doing.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:36.060]   Oh Lord it's all over for the humans folks. But we still have iPads. Which I
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.500]   now started to think is maybe a stealth you know from the world. Between the
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.620]   iPads in the glass you know just we did if you didn't see on Sunday we had a
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.260]   Twitch special I think was 172 where I fix it tore it down. Which was kind of
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.900]   fun to look at the inside guts of it. And once again not only thinner lighter
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.260]   not only the lightest thinnest fastest iPad we've ever made the least
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.340]   repairable and the least recyclable I've had they've ever made. Well you might as
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.780]   well just in case it in a block of glue. Yep. Yeah I didn't feel sure we make a
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.340]   joke during the presentation that it's 100% recyclable if you don't want it
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.940]   someone else will definitely take it off your hands. That's the recycling.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.020]   That's the recycling. Yeah it was interesting and Kyle Wiens and the great
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.940]   team at iFixit if you haven't seen that do watch it because it was kind of fun
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.420]   to watch. The first thing they do is they they you know you ever if you've
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.820]   ever sprained an ankle you know you sometimes you have these worms with
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.820]   beads inside that you put in the freezer or you could put in the microwave it
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.020]   would be hot or cold. So they microwave it they sell this thing. But it's just
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.540]   like the one you buy in the store for a sprained and you microwave it so it's
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.220]   warm there it is and they put it on there and they let it sit. And it warms it
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.940]   up sufficiently that the glue softens and then they use guitar picks all around
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.700]   the edge to pry it loose. These guys are it's pretty amazing professionals. They
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.420]   say the only there is there's the guitar picks the only thing you don't want to
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.220]   do is puncture the lithium ion batteries by the way like as with most previous
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.420]   versions of the iPad it's almost all battery. The motherboard is almost the
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.100]   same size as an iPhone motherboard it's tiny just this little thing but the
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.380]   battery is like most of it and that's how they got good battery life. Pretty
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.980]   amazing battery life once again a non-tech test there it is tested the iPad
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.500]   Air as a my-fi so if you turn off the screen you turn off everything you just
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.900]   use it as a hotspot more than 24 hours. Wow longer than a my- cause it's got a
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.860]   lot of battery. Do you do that all the time? I did that all the time and yesterday I
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:42.500]   was testing it and I was getting 95 down on a Rogers LTE at the coffee shop.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.340]   Take that kill golly. And it's funny because Rogers much much provision
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.340]   tethering differently than that because I can do 50-65 down on an iPhone or an
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.980]   iPad by itself but if I tether them it just shoots right up. Wow. How much are
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.940]   they charging you per gig? I pay 30 bucks for six gigs. That's pretty good actually.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.860]   Because I think that that's the one advantage that I've that I've seen as
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.820]   we start to see companies charging per gig is it does give them a reason to give
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.900]   you fast kind of a fast connection because sure they're making money you
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.820]   know they're you know it's you know before they capped it all because it was
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.660]   free or it was limited you know it was all part of a package now. I can charge
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.740]   you for it. What is it you don't have one yet huh? I don't have one now I've been
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.820]   in Africa. You haven't had a chance. We fortunately John Slania thank you John
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.180]   went to the Apple Store on Friday and got a couple for us so I was able to get
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.900]   this one. Did you get one yet Andy? Yep I got this one in the slick
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:49.500]   flash colored case. Wow it looks just like a human. No one's flesh is that
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:57.820]   coincidence. Well I don't know you don't get a lot of sunlight out there.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.980]   Make Andy look rosy. Is there a cadaver color? Because I think that's actually
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.020]   what you got. Yeah I like it. I mean it's nice you know what the first thing I
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.580]   think is I surprised myself because it isn't well I was trying to decide
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.380]   Retina Mini or this and I was thinking oh maybe you know people were saying
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.660]   I think MGC was said you can hold it in one hand. I don't know MGC must have very
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.060]   big hands because you know I can't hold this with one hand. The wind is just the
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.980]   ability of how long you can hold it in two hands as opposed to one. Oh look Renee
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.140]   did you play basketball? Right there. Big Canadian hands Leo. Oh God you guys are
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.340]   cute. I don't see what your problem is. What? Maybe I have small hands. I didn't
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.660]   know this all this time I've had small hands. Hello with the case. You can do it too.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:47.500]   Yeah hey Renee how's it going? Good one of the game. But wait a minute is it
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.340]   comfortable holding that with one hand? Yeah. Are you feeling a little tendon
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.500]   stretch? It feels like I'm going to bring the Starship Enterprise Leo. Just you
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.740]   know. Be me up. All right all right I take it back. I did notice though that
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.220]   one of the things immediately I noticed is that I tended to want to use it in
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.820]   portrait mode and that what I was really pleased to see is that typing is very
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.660]   natural with the two thumb typing approach in that portrait mode. It's
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.340]   fantastic and I think that that is and it's what is it it's not very much it's
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.780]   maybe a half an inch off the width but is enough enough to make it just enough so
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.980]   that you can do this thumb typing and I tried it on a regular iPad and I couldn't
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.900]   do it. I still don't. Again with my baby hands. I couldn't. So maybe I love it. I
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.940]   had the touch type. It was the first thing I tried and it's fantastic and your
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.620]   thumbs can be in the middle and it's just yeah I use a portrait now it's so good.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.900]   Okay so I'm not alone so it did it seemed like all of a sudden I'm using it in a
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.260]   portrait mode in a very very naturally without even thinking about it. It
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.220]   seemed natural. And it is it's the right aspect ratio I think for reading and
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.180]   stuff in portrait mode. 169 is weird in portrait mode. It's too tall. Yeah even
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.380]   the kindle the new even the kindle fire I mean which I got to use last month.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.660]   It's kind of weird when you have a little bit of stretch. It's not a big problem
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.940]   but it's especially a problem on the surface tablet where you it will
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.900]   rotate to portrait mode but when you use it that way it's telling you again.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.260]   It's like any of us trying to hold the iPad with one hand we can do it but
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.300]   we're making it very clear please make us not have to do this anymore because
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.220]   this is very awkward for us. Now while displaymate does these tests every
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.420]   and I don't know if you guys can say whether this is these are good not or
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.500]   not but displaymate did its regular tests comparing the Kindle Fire HDX,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.940]   the iPad Air and the Google Nexus 10 and said that the then they're talking
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:42.540]   about screen quality sharpness. I presume color gamut and all of that.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.260]   And they said that the fire beat the air not that the air was bad
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.900]   but the fire was better. Well that was one of the things that they were
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.460]   promoting at the get go that this is the this is has the full RGB range
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.260]   that's available. It's the it's the most color compatible
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.380]   screen that's they feel they're saying is on the market today.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.060]   Whether or not it's something that really is visible to the human eye as
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.020]   opposed to test equipment is rather matter entirely.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.060]   Especially we consider that people are really doing a lot of photo apps. They're
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.140]   really doing a lot of like visually intensive and curious things on an
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.020]   iPad whereas anything with a Kindle name on it is
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.300]   chiefly going to be used for books and some movies.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.660]   So black in this in this diagram from the displaymate black is
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.380]   sRGB the standard color gamut and as you can see both the air and the fire
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.620]   pretty close not perfect but the Google Nexus 10 terrible.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.420]   What's about 50? It was an interesting discussion on Twitter from a bunch of
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.140]   iOS designers who were saying that instead of retina they'd prefer
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.220]   either 10 bit color or 120 hertz refresh rate and both those things could
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.340]   maybe make a better difference for you. Yeah well we've reached the point where
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.300]   retina is kind of ho hum everything's retina right?
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.780]   Yeah if it's not retina it's like what's wrong with this?
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.780]   Well I can say 120 refresh rate is much more
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.620]   computationally intensive than and I think that the value of 10 bit
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.140]   display is pretty low. Even photographers I mean you know
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.780]   you know I don't know compared to resolution.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.700]   What? We'd win the test though. We would win the test.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.500]   We would get a gold star you're right.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.780]   We could each try the 240 word S,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.740]   2400 word essay about how but it's the quality. It's the attention detail and
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.340]   the cumulative effect of reconsidering every fundamental decision
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.940]   that adds up to a greater and more profound
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.300]   final product. Exactly. As you said that Andy I saw the balls bouncing around
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.700]   the screen. It's thinner, it's lighter, it's the best iPad we've ever
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.620]   made. Apparently the Kindle Fire is the most accurate.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.980]   Consider considerably more. They have very good color accuracy
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.540]   than the air then the Nexus 10 a distant third. It's a year old though the Nexus
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.780]   10. Yeah I think that's unfair. We're waiting for the next Nexus 10 so.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.940]   And Samsung has never wowed anyone with their display. Right.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.660]   I mean from Pentile on down. But essentially very close between the
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.580]   HDX. I was surprised actually because the HDX is cheap and the iPad Air
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:17.500]   very close. Both impressive mobile displays. The most
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   impressive mobile displays currently available.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.020]   I recently think about the errors. Every 100th of an inch they took off of that
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   was in it was like walking a mile through a desert in terms of engineering
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.780]   resources. It's hugely difficult. So they managed to get this screen. I
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.580]   mean it just looks like it's a little bit thinner but to get that screen
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.500]   and that battery life and a device this thin was a Herculean task of engineering.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.420]   Yeah yeah. But I kind of I really can ask that question. If you took the amount
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.260]   of money in the amount of effort that they took to make this device thinner.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.540]   And I don't know if there's any people who are complaining that oh what I really
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.460]   don't like about the 9.7 inch iPad is that it's just so damn thick.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.540]   I mean if you if you took those resources and added extra features like if you
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.740]   figure out a way to keep it as thick as it ever was but give it a pressure
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.340]   sensitive tablet. Excuse me a touch interface you can use it for art and
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.940]   for other input stuff. Wouldn't that be really really cool or improve the
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.060]   display in other ways. I don't know if you'd even notice one point what is it?
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.100]   One point four millimeters. Would you notice the difference?
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.220]   I mean it's not I don't I personally it's a leak that really sells this.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.220]   Yeah the weight here is really what it is. It's 0.4 pounds lighter.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.740]   It's a lot smaller. And and this is the the width difference and width is really
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.540]   the biggest difference. The height is about the same. It definitely feels a
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.540]   lot. And the bezels are of course the right reason. It's less intimidating.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:39.100]   Yeah but I'm not a mini I was I'm quick to say now having held it is I still
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.140]   think I want to get the mini with retina as my preferred iPad.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.860]   It's not quite the mini especially now that the mini is
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.500]   spec wise identical. We think but here's the here's a question but what are
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.260]   what are you planning on using the mini for? Everything I use an iPad for and more.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.660]   Really since I might eat off of it. I don't know. No I use the mini at home.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.540]   I keep my my maxi pad here and I keep my mini pad at home.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.860]   God please don't see that. I do the opposite. I use the mini for traveling
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.540]   and tethering and I use the big iPad at home for videos and comic books and.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.300]   Well remember the big iPad stays here. It doesn't go anywhere ever. It's what I
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.460]   use for iPad today in this show. And the mini is the one I use as I'm you
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.500]   know in the house. All right let's face it in the can.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.980]   And and and I do hold it with one hand.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.820]   What what? Leo I just wanted to make an observation here.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.420]   You are one more such observation from turning this into an episode of Girls.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.460]   I mean you can just be naked on the next show.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.460]   I'm gonna play naked ping pong. Yeah they can ping pong next.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.340]   On a very special. Have you gotten the new um.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.820]   Not yet it comes it comes Friday they call me up apparently a truck has to
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.020]   deliver it it's so big. Really? Truck delivery company said yeah we got I
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.980]   said you get the whole toilet or just the stick of the whole toilet. Oh yeah.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.580]   I said what's in it. He said it's ceramic. He said oh I know what that is.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.540]   You got the whole thing. Oh well yeah I figured because if you get the whole thing
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.780]   then the toilet raises up to greet you. Yes it does.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.660]   Maybe the tight is right. He's up to the only reason I brought that up is that is
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.620]   that you know what what really missing is an app on your iPad that just
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.140]   you know can control the. Ah they have a remote but it seems silly.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.940]   No it's a if you had it. Not to mention the high. I don't think anyone wants to.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.340]   The high genicity of the idea of a remote for a toilet is but it is a touch
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.260]   toilet right. You never touch nothing. Exactly. It touches you but you don't touch it.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.820]   Use it for the same reason. Use the phone app for your Tesla for your other
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.460]   car. It's so that you're in bed. You want to like push a button have it nice and
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.380]   warm so that when you actually use it there's there's no you know sudden
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.740]   shock of the morning. Actually it's always warm. Oh really?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.900]   They say well you can decide whether you want to let it cool.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.580]   I said it warmed up to greet you again also. It's a can but it opens up it
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.980]   warms up the water starts warming up. Yes. There's a little fan. Oh yeah.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.220]   Oh yeah. Hey beyond gizwiz. You don't want cold water on your hoo-ha. That is not good.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:06.700]   That water. No not the water. Andy is officially taking a moment.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.420]   I'm just thinking. No I'm just thinking about my grandfather who was a goat herder
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.940]   until age 12 at 13 and then made it to the United States of America.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.620]   Suffering unbearable hardship in his first two or three years to start a new life in a new
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.660]   family with very very little resources and then knowing that his grandchild's
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.180]   generation really really wants a toilet that is self-warming and
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:33.980]   the cuddles it says nice things about it. That's the I'm just not sure that I could have survived
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.860]   as a goat herder for one thing. Well and the worst part is if you spend too much time I spent
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:46.140]   six weeks in Japan on a film and you get anywhere that doesn't have those those types of toilets.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.340]   You immediately like what I'm in some sign of slum here. I mean what is wrong here?
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.420]   I spent a month in Guangzhou they had a plank and a ditch. Yeah.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.220]   Yeah. I'm used to places where you're lucky if you don't get a splitter.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:05.660]   All right we're gonna take a break and then I'm going to show you speaking of Guangdong
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:12.540]   province my new iPhone picked up from China. Oh this might be a little different than what
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.740]   you're expecting. But first a word from shuttleslock.com.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:25.180]   Shutterslock is the place to go for over 30 million royalty free stock photos illustrations
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:31.100]   vectors and videos too. In fact if you click the footage tab at the top of the screen 1.3 million
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:38.700]   royalty free stock videos too. I love shuttersock. I know you'll love it too. In fact I encourage
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:44.300]   you just to sign up for the free shuttersock account because you don't have you know it's very
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.380]   simple you don't have to give them a credit card. Each week you'll get a free photo that's you know
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:54.060]   part of the deal. You get the newsletter course giving you ideas updates and of course they always
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.860]   have new stuff I think more than a hundred thousand new photos every week. And you can use their
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:06.460]   light boxes which is a very nice feature. The light box allows you to save images as you travel
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.740]   through your life and use them for inspiration share them with colleagues share them with others
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:17.100]   and of course you can use the amazing shutterslock search. So let's search for a happy you can search
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:23.820]   for a noun like toilet. But wouldn't you prefer to search for a happy toilet? So you can actually
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:31.500]   use adjectives along with a noun. And wow you wouldn't think there'd be so many happy toilet images.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:42.380]   There are. And we're just continuing to warn this. Why not? You know we're here. Oh this guy's a
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:49.660]   little too happy. Oh I don't know if I'm showing that on the phone. Shutterscock there's an image
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.820]   for every concept every idea. Their search is great. They also have the color wheel that lets you
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.860]   say I want happy blue toilets you know or any color to match because you understand you want
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.820]   to match the theme of your website or your publication. And the key is that you're going to get any
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.180]   time you're using stock photography. We use a lot of stock photography. You know that the licensing
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.300]   sorted out. You know that you have a high quality image. And it's really built for what you need.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.020]   It is really the key to the operation. I mean you know to as far as when you're putting together
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.940]   any kind of website. A lot of the images that you see on blogs and news sites and everything else
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.500]   that our closeups are coming. That's stock photography. I mean it's not trying to figure out how to do
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.940]   it themselves. No I used to. I used to try to figure out like how am I going to take a photo of this?
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.220]   And then I realized I can just go look at the bottom of a lot of pages. You'll always sit a lot of
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.340]   times you see courtesy image shutter stock. It's very very popular. If you decide hey I think I need
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.940]   this you can buy image packs. You can do the subscription. That's what we do 25 images a day.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.380]   That's for the company. Use the offer code MAC break 1113 for November 13 November 2013.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:00.620]   And you'll get 25% off. That's a good deal on your new subscription or your new photo package.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:07.100]   Look here's Santa. And then here's angry Santa. Do you think they'll be an angry Santa? Santa's never
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:14.780]   angry. Yes. Yes there is. He is very angry. He's also unshaven. He is. Wait a minute. Santa.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:23.180]   Knock it off. I think Santa just flipped me the bird. So you see even Santa.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.180]   That's a really angry Santa. I don't I think all he's pulling his cold.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.620]   He's an angry reindeer. Wow. But you know if you're going to do the post on you know why I'm mad
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:40.460]   this holiday. Why I hate Christmas. You might need an angry. We need you. That's like the recruiting
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:47.580]   for reindeer. Here's an angry Santa girl. Here's a Santa who apparently is stuck in the chimblie.

[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:06.620]   picking up iPad airs? There is a I guess that was a rhetorical question. I don't know.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:16.940]   There is a finder right and Apple has a finder where you can see what the availability is store
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:23.660]   by store. At that moment shipping dates are slipping. They all do. So it's easy to get.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.660]   Well they did. They did at launch. They had really good stock.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.340]   And then there's apparently is this a third party site? Apple dash tracker.com.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:37.660]   This is it is obviously a third party site. And look you can go you can go by store
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:45.420]   by color by carrier. So let's do it in our in our zip code 94952. There aren't very many
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:51.260]   Apple stores. Santa Rosa. Yes. Yeah. Every every size except 128. Hey the 128 seem to be selling
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:57.340]   out. I'll have to go. That's the way to go. I have to go to come on now. Is it? Yeah. I just got
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:03.900]   the one for I got a 60 everything I've gotten a 64 lately and everything is full. So the only
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:09.740]   problem really is is that iCloud maxes out at 55 gigs. What does the deal with that? Like how
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.380]   do you make a how how much was to back something up to iCloud? You can buy more to get to under
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.980]   can't go you can't go higher than to get 128 gig. I think that their assumption is that you're
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.380]   not going to back up your music or your movies. But I still have a problem where I have a whole
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:30.060]   bunch of devices and I'm constantly getting a little alert that I'm I'm out. Yeah. And also
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.100]   they're very very obnoxious about those alerts to I exceeded my max about three weeks ago and
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.300]   I'm definitely going to get to it and I've been shipping down it. But it really it's really a
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.300]   pain in the butt that every time I take out an iPhone every time I take an iPhone I know that
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.900]   I've got to march past four different warning thing. Sorry this but this iPad's not been back
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.740]   that in four weeks. I can't say it's a pre-season because I'm exposing it iCloud. I'm sorry I can't
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.380]   really back up your your photo cloud until it's come on just let me let me there should be a checkbox
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.980]   saying please let me say that I get it please let me fail on my own because you're just knowing
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.380]   the hell out of me right now. Yeah. But you definitely you definitely should get it. I'm a big big big
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:08.780]   supporter of getting the 128 error or or even the previous iPads chiefly because it gives you so
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:15.500]   much extra flexibility. You can manage a 16 or 32 gig iPhone because it's a different kind of device.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   When you have the maximum amount of storage on the iPad though that means that when you're traveling
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.180]   you can every single night when you get back to your hotel room use the camera adapter to slurp
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.660]   all your photos off the memory card into memory you'll go home with about 48 gigabytes worth of
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.220]   photos and raw photos when you're using this thing as a backup storage device and you won't have to
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.780]   take your notebook with you and you can still have room for HD videos you can still have room for
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.620]   for all your audio books you can still have room for all your music it's just such a bummer but
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.500]   the first time probably three or four weeks after you have your first iPad when it tells you I'm sorry
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.180]   we can't back this up we can't sync this because you're out of space you don't ever want to run out
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:55.100]   of space. And I truly don't understand why Apple doesn't have doesn't just keep on scaling that
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.860]   that opportunity you know especially now that they have a lot of devices like this and they have a
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.260]   lot of users with multiple devices it really needs to be able to go up to if people want to pay for
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.540]   it up to two or three hundred you know gigs of backup and there's no solution that says good
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.300]   you can't use like Google Drive which you can buy before. Nothing's native yeah nothing's easy.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.100]   Yeah they think that they give you a lot of stuff for free like a lot of like the photo stream stuff
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.460]   is all stored quote unquote for free and a lot of the other stuff is stored for free but
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.580]   someone like Alex is going to go through all the non-free data in about 20 minutes anyway so
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.900]   it would behoove them to have as it would behoove them to give you a lot more a way for free like
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.740]   just the basic level storage and then to have more reasonable tiers because right now it's not at
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.220]   all competitive with what everyone else is. I wonder if it has to do okay so I'm going to admit something
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:46.700]   that I have many people using my iCloud account because they're sharing the apps right and so
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.700]   I have maybe you know four iPhones. It's like a quarter of my ads. Yeah most of petalomas.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.900]   Yeah I mean that is. No but I mean most I have a lot of family members. He's a lot of friends
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.220]   because we walk on friends like hey Leo there are people in my life who are family members
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.260]   but there's enough of them and maybe that's why maybe they want to keep me from doing that.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.660]   Like encourage you to get a new account. I didn't notice that it felt like I
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.740]   they really wanted me to create a new account on the iPad. Maybe but it just seems like there's
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:21.260]   a lot of people that have if you have an iPhone 64 gig iPhone and a 64 gig iPad you know and
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.660]   you know it seems like it's easy to do. It's easy to run out. It's easy to go over. Right.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.140]   I have several iPads. I have a big one. I have my Macs. I was being conservative. I've got a couple
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.020]   of everything. I have my mini pad. I have my iPhone. I have my old iPhone. That's four right there.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.500]   And it's not clear. I mean it'll store the photos for free but not the videos and it lets
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.060]   you back up camera roll as well as photo stream. The apps are all free because those can be
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.780]   redownloaded but the app data can vary like a game has very little in app data but an app that
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.380]   uses that creates a lot of documents for you will have a lot of it and it ends up being just so
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.220]   confusing that nobody really knows how much storage they have until they get that annoying
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.980]   warning that Andy was talking about. Part of this is that Apple is not as big a company as we think
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:06.380]   it is. Isn't it? Seriously. I mean we assume that they're that they have unlimited data centers
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.620]   and they don't. They built that new big one in North Carolina but now they're building new
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.700]   ones in Oregon and Reno. They need to build more. They don't have the capacity. I think they need
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.340]   to move the data centers to the sea. Oh wait. Like also mail takes up a lot like my most of mine is
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.860]   taken up by mail with attachments in it. So I have to go and either archive the mail or get rid of
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.020]   the emails that have old attachments in it. And that's a problem on your iPad. Yeah because I have
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.740]   my iCloud account is on my iPad but my iCloud account email just keeps piling up and uses more
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.620]   and more. I think you only get the last thousand images. I mean last I use iCloud email. That's the
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:44.620]   first thing you probably want to stop doing. Why do you use iCloud email? I forward my personal
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.180]   Gmail. I have a work Gmail account but I forward my personal Gmail to iCloud because Gmail just
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:55.420]   never worked well for me. Who uses gave me? Well it doesn't now use Mavericks. Forget it. It's dead.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.660]   Before that for years I've had bandwidth exceeded errors. I don't know how you exceed Google's bandwidth
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:04.860]   but I got those errors. I had simultaneous connection errors. I got inbox not found errors and I just
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:10.780]   got to the point where it wasn't working so much I forgot about it. What a surprise. It doesn't work
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:18.940]   well. I think probably new users typically would use iCloud because it's just there for their email
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:25.660]   but do real people really use iCloud for email? I can't remember the last time I actually got
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:32.460]   something from an iCloud address. Yeah I mean all I get in my iCloud inbox is Apple offers and
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:39.100]   newsletters. A lot of people who either work at Apple or work in products associated with Apple
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:44.780]   still use iCloud going back to Mac or iTunes days. Yeah by me.com address. Yeah.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:52.300]   I use it for something but I don't know what. I think that means you do by accident. An edge case
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:57.500]   Renee is what I'm saying. It might be but I think my mom has a me account just because she set it up
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.540]   with a new account. That's what I would expect. Sure. Yeah. Oh they give me email too aren't they
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:08.700]   nice those people? Well it's just sort of there and if you're part of the Apple ecosystem it does
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.380]   real push. Gmail now doesn't do push unless you have the paid account. Everyone does push but
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.780]   doesn't do exchange which is my preferred way of using Gmail. I agree unless you have the paid account
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:22.380]   and the mobile email just for a lot not mobile. Sorry iCloud mail for a lot of people just the
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.540]   contacts mail and calendar sync work really well. If you're a new user and you just buy your iPad
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.700]   or your iPhone it gets set up as part of the iCloud system anyway so I don't even know if they
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:40.300]   would know that they're using it but they're using it. The company Fixoo. Not a good name. Fixoo
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:49.900]   is a mobile app marketing company and they apparently look at online devices and stuff like that.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:57.500]   They say according to their numbers iPad Air adoption numbers 500% higher than iPad 4
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:04.220]   on opening weekend 400% higher than the mini. I'm not surprised. Big adoption because a lot of us
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:11.500]   Fixoo. Myself included a lot of us skipped 4. I mean so I skipped 4. I skipped 4. I'm waiting. I
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:19.740]   have to go out and get 5 now but I was like it's not enough so not enough from 3. So a lot of people
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.820]   remember that was when everyone assumed that Apple would never release two full-sized iPads in the
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.060]   same year. So a lot of people like myself bought the iPad 3 for retina and then several months later
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:36.140]   there's the iPad 4. So everybody that year had either I think already bought the iPad 3 or they had
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.180]   basically told themselves that this is 2012 was not a year which I'm going to be buying a full-sized
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:48.220]   iPad. So. And I think that now that'll be my last iPad 3 I think is my last 30 pin device.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.820]   Which is can't wait. I can't wait. You know I know we complained about it when they first changed it
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:59.740]   but do we really is there any argument that that is the best device connector made right now?
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.740]   Yeah but I would say I wish they'd come to the US micro USB is such a crappy little connection.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.540]   Well it is such a horrible little it's just universal so it is but the problem is that
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:17.020]   little micro USB cable my my iPhone needs to be charged here. I let it go overnight.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:22.700]   You're Shenzhen iPhone. You can tell looking at it could you tell? I wanted to turn it on because
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:30.140]   it's got iOS 7 on it. $40. Does it have iOS 7 or Android 4.2? It has Android that looks exactly
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.540]   like iOS 7 but I can't show you because I need to charge your cable. I let it die.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:40.780]   I also have by the way a Lumia this is a my Nokia Lumia 1020 running. I wonder if I could turn this
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:46.540]   one on. Yeah they all died. I let them I forgot to charge them. Oh you patterned right to save the
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:55.020]   battery. Well let's power up. Yeah see it's a it's not HTC it's HTM. Has honeycomb logo?
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:01.660]   Yeah and let's say this is at least it says Android but only when you first turn it on.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:07.420]   Why do you see this? So this looks like it's gold. The gold ring. You'll acceptable color.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:13.740]   I'm getting the boot menu in Chinese. What should I do Jason?
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:22.460]   I get I'm getting in recovery mode. Oh crap. AB 8 B. I think there's a certain level of
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:28.060]   you get what you pay for. Who speaks Chinese here? Charbacks brought these by from me.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.620]   What? You see these these phones that run MS toss they cost a little bit less money but in the
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.700]   game and you're really going to wish that you had a real opportunity to call the oh now it's
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:48.940]   making a high pitched tone. Chinese person come here. That's not just a random tone.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.340]   I've run. Wait. Now it's taking a camera. That's the phone uploading uploading all the data.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.860]   Tony what is networked to a server? This is just this is just booting up right.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.620]   Some we see some we see all the screens start changing as it as it takes over.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.380]   What does what does that say? It says forced Bluetooth pairing.
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.700]   Tony. Tony speaks Chinese. Thank goodness.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:17.100]   It doesn't make any sense. Oh maybe I'll take it to the genius bar. They could
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.980]   figure this out right? Yeah. Apple's real good. Yeah bring me bring actually if you give me
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:27.100]   one that's I can just plug into the the Mac. I don't know what the Mac's gonna do when it sees it.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:32.140]   You think it'll boot iTunes? I don't think you want to plug that into a computer.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.780]   I wouldn't do that. What could possibly go wrong? How many
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.460]   extra cuticles are on that? You know what's funny is they make this look just like a lightning
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.620]   connector even though I presume it's micro USB but they make it you know like look like it. Yeah.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:50.220]   These are very popular in by the way it's that little is it lightning? No.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.700]   Is it mini micro? It's just I would like to hate about USB. Yeah.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.860]   Yeah. You can't really tell. A have you have to decide which direction and B if you get that
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.860]   little tongue in the center bent your desk. You're screwed. Yeah. And so the move to a
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:10.460]   to a completely solid connector. No it's better. I agree with you but it's just not universal.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.220]   Plus you had to buy the pins that they can do with that thing. The lightning is really flexible
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.620]   and what they can do with it. Yeah. Oh it's doing stuff. It's signals. It says my name Leo and then
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.340]   it's saying I'm getting all my information off the computer. Uploading uploading all data to
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.940]   things like doing some army. Thanks you Leo. Yeah. It's warning. No suitable AP.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:36.460]   It's like it's like like a Linux boot. This is going through some bizarre boots. No it's
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.140]   just showing you stuff while it's downloading everything from your computer. It's just keeping
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:45.420]   you distracted. You're like looking at it going what is it doing? It's going to upload to Chinese
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.900]   government wants to see. I think I saw this on blacklist last week. James Spader's in my phone.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:58.460]   It's acquired acquired back door into government servers. Oh what's it? It wants $300 in money
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:05.180]   pack coupons. What? Yes. What? Anyway we'll let this boot up but yeah I have the Nokia. Oh sorry
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:12.220]   about the reflection there. The Nokia 10 11 or what a 10 10 20. Except it's not. And and also a
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:19.020]   Galaxy Note 3 with actual stitched. Oh it costs like what under $100. Oh yeah they're like 40 and 50
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:25.420]   bucks. Yeah. Is real leather? This one's real leather. It has an S Pen. Look at this. Those
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:33.580]   marketplaces are really really equal to. I went to win that. It's got a fake S Pen. It doesn't.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:40.620]   It's just a it's milled. It's just a. Oh oh the Androids doing things I've never seen it done before.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:47.100]   Wow. So yeah but this is but in China this is why the iPhone has a hard time selling in China
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.980]   because for $40 you can get something that fools your friends.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.580]   They boot it up. So they boot it up. This looks just like the Galaxy Note
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:05.180]   paper but it doesn't do the the S hub. Yeah come on really. Shub. Shub. Yeah it looks like a real
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:12.860]   S hub to me. Yeah I want to thank Charbecs from. Oh look how look how much this looks like Windows
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.220]   phone. This is apparently Android can be skinned to look exactly like any operating system.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   These tiles even come alive. Like embedded Unix like embedded Linux at this point.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:27.820]   Apparently I made a mistake. I pressed the wrong button and I wonder if I could turn it off.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.900]   And that's that's also that's both why Apple's having trouble and why Apple's not having trouble.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:38.860]   Right. Well if you could have it means 43 bucks but if you could afford what must be
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.140]   a considerable amount of money in China for an iPhone that you don't need to do.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.500]   What does the Chinese how do you say in Chinese how's that working for you.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.900]   Let's get Tony back.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:55.100]   All right we're gonna take a break come back with the more we're talking the
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.660]   Macintosh and Apple and the Anako he's got a flight in 45 minutes.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.540]   So we're gonna let you we're gonna get you out of here in 45 minutes I promise.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.100]   Renee Richie from imore.com. Where are you speaking Andy? Alex Lindsey.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.740]   I'm speaking at the Mac conference in LA that's a really cool conference that Neil
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.220]   Ticton does every single year and also in regional various things of it.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.260]   And do you have a can talk you do or what do you talk about?
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:29.260]   No well I don't have I think that's the problem. I don't have any like pre-prepared
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.580]   talks so anytime I'm invited to like keynote or talk somewhere I almost always have to
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.620]   write something brand new just for that purpose. So it's gonna be on Friday and it's now open to
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.500]   the public but if you want to buy a conference pass I'm sure you can still buy a conference pass.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.700]   Awesome awesome.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:51.420]   If you do want to learn about administration or development again in terms of conferences that
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.220]   are you both maximize these two things of A learning a hell of a lot and also having a really really
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:01.340]   great time. I don't think that there's anything that maximizes both of them. Last year Neil
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.380]   arranged for like a behind the scenes tour of Disney animation and we got to see a
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.220]   Wreck-It Ralph like a month or it was released and also like they actually everybody stayed
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.860]   stayed behind in the office for like three hours afterward to like basically show
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.420]   unless they're software and show as their models and show as their process. So this time this time
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.860]   we're visiting the space shuttle. Oh neat as I said it's a it's a it's a good time you learn
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.980]   something but then after after everything's done you have a good time at night. Real fun.

[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.300]   very good. I think I liked it better because I was such a fan of the book. I don't know how
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.420]   people who didn't read the book felt about it. I think of it as literary Zen. Because you just
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:32.620]   a lot of times when I would normally be impatient I'm just like I'm in a traffic jam. I'll listen to
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.860]   a book. I'm listening. I'm enjoying it. Sometimes I'll drive around the blocker. I'll park in the
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.260]   driveway and keep listening. I listen when I'm on the treadmill or the rowing machine. I got the
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:48.220]   headphones in and it makes time go by really quickly. Here's how here's the deal. If you go to audible.com/macbreak

[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:16.300]   Andy what are you listening to these days? See there? Ooh speaker for the dead. So they have
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.620]   it looks like they have the whole enders game series. So if you did like the book
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:26.780]   you might want to go to its sequel speaker for the dead which is quite interesting.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:32.460]   Xenocide, children of the mind, first meetings in the end of verse. Wow there's more than I
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:41.180]   thought. Ender in exile. Chance to go through the whole oovra. What are you listening to on the
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:47.260]   flight today? Actually I bought something especially for it. It's kind of an oddball thing. It's a
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.540]   like a 90 minute like sort of essay on creativity by David Lynch called catching the big fish,
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:59.260]   meditation, consciousness and creativity. And first of all what really got me was just the
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:05.340]   fact that it's David Lynch talking for 90 minutes about his process. And that's a little bit like
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.820]   listening to Hunter S. Thompson talk about drug use. Even if you know that you're not capable of
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.860]   those such things yourselves it's going to be an ender and he'll enter inside into why he does
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.900]   things that he does. And I absolutely love David Lynch. But also like before I bought it I pulled
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:23.660]   up like some it's kind of a famous talk he gave or piece that he wrote. And here's one quote from
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.100]   it. He says this David Lynch talking saying I hate slick and pretty things. I prefer mistakes
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.500]   and accidents which is why I like things like cuts and bruises. They're like little flowers.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.700]   I've always said that if you have a name for something like cut or bruise people will automatically
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   be disturbed by it. But when you see the same thing in nature and you don't know what it is it can
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.340]   be very beautiful. So that's what's that's what I'm looking forward to during my flight today.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:52.060]   So you're saying this is more of David Lynch early early period David Lynch than Mulholland
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:58.540]   Drive David Lynch. It looks that way right if it's and of course it's not a story just more like
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:04.140]   right. He's a big promoter of transcendental meditation. He's got a TM center. He's gotten a lot of a lot
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.660]   of Hollywood people into transcendental meditation. So and I gather this is something about that.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:16.860]   I'm going to add that to my. Yeah. It looks like. Yeah. So you can get that for free. You can get a
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:22.380]   enders game or it's sequels for free. You can get spinal breathing pranayama for free.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:30.940]   It's it's all it's all there. If you want it. They also have the great courses which I they
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:37.180]   just added this recently. I really love these are the best college teachers in the country.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:44.380]   They look there's a book on course on meditation but also on communication. This is my favorite
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.980]   Robert Greenberg's had to listen to and understand great music. I loved this. Get that for free.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.020]   Money and banking. What everyone should know. Einstein's relativity in the quantum revolution.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:00.540]   Modern physics for non scientists 12 hours 20 minutes. That's probably 12 lectures.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.740]   Really great stuff and and you're getting. I mean you're pouring stuff into your mind that is going to
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.860]   be you know as just fabulous the art of critical decision making transformational leadership.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   The Vikings. How would you like to spend 17 hours learning about the Vikings from one of the
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:24.780]   top professors of Viking ology. I would. The Spartans. Spartans. I think I I listened to that book
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:30.220]   like four times rise and fall of China. Great stuff audible.com slash Mac break.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:38.060]   Try it free. Today. We thank them for their support of Mac break weekly. Lots of problems with the
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.740]   with let's talk about Mavericks first then Mac book pro with retina.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:49.420]   What are all the issues that Apple apparently testing and update to Apple mail for the Gmail
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:57.980]   issues. I haven't gotten any gmail in mail since I upgraded. I thought it was just you know.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:03.580]   People who done some workarounds you know according to tidbits but it's more than that.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.220]   Do we know what's wrong.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   Gmail has always had like it's never been an i map app. An i map based service. Real i
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.860]   something beyond email. Yeah. They've they've kind of begrudgingly provided i map but it's quirky
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.900]   eccentric i map. So it's never been great and if you just used it if you just input your credentials
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:28.620]   and used it it'll keep working the same way it's always worked but if you did those fancy
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.460]   workarounds like a lot of people hit their all mail folder because it took up a lot of space on
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:38.220]   their hard drive. So they got rid of it and now with Mavericks mail that no longer plays nicely.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:42.220]   So you have to restore the all mail folder and apparently Apple's aware of all this and they're
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:47.340]   going to rush out of fix as fast as they can. Yeah they're they're apparently testing it.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:55.660]   Oh dear what's now what's going on i've got. This is in color now. I wish i could tell what's
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:03.740]   what i'm doing here. Oh let's just go ahead and push the button. Oh feels like the Android
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:10.140]   recovery scanning your fingerprint Leo. That does not oh something happened that does not work.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:14.380]   Maybe i just picked the right one let's see don't touch anything that or it's going to break.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:22.620]   Is it is it Google's fault is it Apple's fault gmail is non-standard that certainly sounds like
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.820]   Google's fault. It's a regression if you're a gmail user who used to use gmail and mail.app
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.700]   and it's a regression for you. It doesn't no longer works as well as it did. Apple will probably bring
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   it up to parity but it's never going to because it's not standard i map it will never be a great
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.580]   experience in mail.app so a lot of people use airmail or mail plane or just put it in use it in chrome
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:48.940]   where it belongs. It's it's suboptimal but it'll be better right here it is here's ios 7 now on my
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:55.740]   look it even does the fingerprint no it doesn't. This is a nice decoration decoration there. Isn't
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:01.020]   that funny is this is a hand-off the youtube app they've even duplicated the this is the clock
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:06.140]   app and it looks just like the apple cause their maps let's see what what where where they get
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:14.940]   maps from it is it does say i 280 it uh yeah well let's skip that uh updated the latest oh it's
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.580]   Google maps that's Google maps right yeah that's Google maps but you know you probably wouldn't know
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:28.300]   or care let's see what the app store takes us to that's the apple app store isn't it what this
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:35.020]   is bizarre it must be a fake app store it looks just like it go ahead put your credit card in there
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:42.780]   you don't want to pay for things in that app store uh weather is this going to be the new weather
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.740]   uh it's the old weather but that's pretty good in Beijing in Beijing so this is actually it is
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:52.860]   obviously as you saw Android oh passbook let me put my credit card numbers in here there you go
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.140]   that'll that'll work
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:50:02.380]   um isn't that amazing yeah i don't think even people think that they're getting a real
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.940]   iPhone i think that they just want enough of the iPhone experience that they can enjoy it right
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.340]   i i don't that's what's that's what's being delivered here right i mean it's cold it's cold
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:16.460]   it's got it's got a phony iOS 7 i just took a picture let me take a good picture let's take a
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.420]   picture of Alex that's not gonna be a good picture no matter how you do it i made it a little cool
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.260]   i think but let's see i mean this is pretty functional for 43 dollars
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:37.020]   does it pinch yeah look can you zoom multi-touch wow one to seven finger tracking
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:46.300]   wow um so that so the mail is one issue where there are other issues in mavericks you mentioned
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:51.020]   one rene just before the show you said occasionally when you play a youtube video sound goes out
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:56.380]   yeah it's not just youtube i mean uh that's one of the things i can cause it if you play a flash
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:01.500]   video or anything that plays audio seemingly through a video player that is based on flash like youtube
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   coraudio can cut out coraudio is a service that runs all audio on os 10 and you either have to go
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:12.620]   into activity monitor and kill the coraudio process and it's listed there alphabetically
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:17.660]   or you have to reboot for it to come back um coraudio has always been a little problematic a little
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.460]   flaky in some areas but this is the first time it's doing that and hopefully that'll get fixed
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.820]   and you can restart that in the activity monitor and it would it would get better
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:33.260]   uh also complaints about the new iCloud keychain which is a neat idea but uh john broad can running
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:40.220]   at ours technica uh suggests not abandoning last pass or one password it is it is not a
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:47.020]   replacement uh for those uh i have to say i i was puzzled by the the setup which said oh you
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.020]   could just authenticate with your four digit code and then still sent me a text message
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:58.220]   and said i needed that um he says basically it's it's fairly limited
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:05.420]   um limits the length of passwords to 12 letters numbers and three dashes every time
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.180]   that's the password generator that's that's even not as good as the old keychain password
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:14.140]   generator which was much more flexible that's odd well and i think that for someone who's not
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:20.220]   it's great it's great to add something like this for someone who's not using last pass or um you know
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.660]   or one password better than nothing it's better than nothing it gives you a little bit more control
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:28.220]   and so on so forth if you're already using one of those services there's a lot of power in both of
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.980]   those services um and i i think that it would be very hard for people who are already using it to
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:37.740]   give it up so you do have this auto fill if you want to turn it on you can go to preferences
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:43.660]   passwords click the box it says auto fill use your names and passwords you can also allow auto fill
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:48.620]   for even for websites that request passwords not be saved typically a bank that seems like a bad
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.620]   idea i would not turn that on although it is convenient also public yeah public terminals
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:57.740]   do that too uh yeah right if if you're a bad guy that's the first thing you do is you turn that on
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:04.140]   a public terminal um oddly enough uh it does say enabling this override requires the mac be
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.780]   configured to lock the screen with idle that's good but it still fails to auto fill passwords
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:16.220]   in some websites most notably applezone iCloud.com oops they all have some trouble in some websites
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:22.060]   i mean we all do yeah for mysterious reasons sometimes i mean this is like time machine for
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.500]   security it's intended it's not intended for anyone already using one password or last pass
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:29.580]   or anything it's intended for people who like touch ID never had any form of security and at
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:37.660]   worst it provides education that this stuff exists anyway nice anything to get them to use
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.300]   like stronger password system it's better than nothing i guess that's the best you can say about it
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:50.460]   um and now let's talk about the macbook pro with retina there were people reporting
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.380]   we talked last week about the ghosting issues and then people were reporting keyboard and trackpad
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:59.420]   issues in the 13 inch apparently according to cnet apple is working on a fix for those input
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:06.620]   issues um i would i would just like to go back to what we've talked about just don't do it just
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.740]   just wait you know it's a big upgrade all those fixes will come both with the operating system
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:18.620]   in the hardware yeah give it a version uh in a knowledge base page uh last week the company
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:24.220]   said apple is aware of rare circumstances where the built-in keyboard and multi-touch trackpad may
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:30.460]   become unresponsive in a 13 inch macbook bro with retina late 2013 and is working on an update to
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:36.300]   resolve this behavior meanwhile they say the workaround is put the computer to sleep for about a minute
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:43.660]   give it a nap and see if it's cranky after the red nut but it's very tired let it sleep for a minute
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.460]   and then re-wake it and see if it feels better it's very tired tired this computer has not you
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.460]   haven't let it go to sleep for four days but that that's good news because it means it's software
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:59.260]   not hardware and it'll be fixable right right uh well it's software that's trying to fix for the
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.980]   hardware we don't know what the issue yeah we don't know what the issue is i mean i think that
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.460]   again i think that there's a with any of any time there's a brand new hardware and it's
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.980]   hard for me because i really want the mac bros but i also really want to get the second version
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:20.140]   yeah once they've been gamutested i actually love my macbook bro with retina this is last
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:24.060]   years that i'm using here and then i have the oh i have a i have a lot of macbook bros i love it
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.260]   they're great machines yeah yeah
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:38.220]   uh oh oh if you have an i phone five s with battery issues uh apples acknowledge that and is replacing
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:45.180]   those uh as well so the that that is not unusual for you know when you're making a new phone
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:50.220]   if they're issues customers with affected units will be contacted to receive a replacement device
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:57.820]   um apples pr department says the issue can cause shortened battery life longer charge times are
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.220]   batteredly that will no longer charge uh so they'll they apparently know
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:08.380]   uh which serial numbers are affected right they know what happened it's a bad batch yeah
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:15.100]   uh and they'll call you if you haven't yet gotten a call call a call apple care and uh they will
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.700]   they'll give you know you give them the serial number and they'll check and it doesn't sound like
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:26.060]   this is a lot of phones that have this problem right no it's a tiny amount yeah like someone you
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:30.300]   know took a took a bile break you know right for like 15 minutes 15 minutes
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:34.620]   with a box con they put the eye on it but they forgot to put the lithium in
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:39.100]   it happens all the time like the dude who was sealing the battery or whatever he he was like oh
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:44.940]   then fox con you know it was like in a thousand it went by all iPhones made on monday yeah well
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.460]   no no it was going like a thousand number went by in that 15 minutes and and then it came back and
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:54.060]   he's like i thought we were breaking oh man oh man i don't think anyone's gonna notice
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:57:02.140]   um launch of ipad in early 2010 coincides with a quantum leap
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.620]   inviscid to apple stores i guess you could expect the same thing in 2013 this is again
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:14.540]   harris dead of you the amazing analyst that is a simko blog you can you can actually track
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:19.660]   the releases of products by the spikes and visitors to the store
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:27.900]   you see those see those poles there that's when new ipads came out personal setup was brilliant
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:32.380]   yeah average visitors per store per quarter big spiky thing there
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.220]   except for seasonal peaks the visitors per store per quarter fairly steady
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.620]   so what caused the quantum jump in traffic was it due to a redesign of the stores was it
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.460]   changing the product mix was it due to a change in staffing rules no
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.980]   um i'm thrilled that he's spending so much time on those things you know just new ipads that'll do it
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:58:01.420]   ron johnson uh said at the time former head of apple retail it was as if the stores were designed
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:07.260]   for an ipad it's something that needs to be discovered with a retail experience i think with
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.620]   the new one you're gonna see the same thing because people are gonna want to go in and feel it and
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:15.580]   touch it and perhaps want to compare it to the mini with retina do we know a day for the mini with
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.180]   retina yet we we know it's this month supposedly right late november
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:25.820]   yeah after Thanksgiving here too black friday right that's that sounds like that would be the
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:34.300]   right day wouldn't it yeah i i heard black friday but only just well what is uh it's only if i heard
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:40.700]   let me look at the calendar here so thanksgiving is uh the black friday is uh is the 29th i give
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:46.940]   you the most possible weekdays to work on finishing it it means basically it's that or the day after
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.940]   well if you did a big if you did it on black friday it means that all the press that was normally go to
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:55.980]   black friday it goes to apple lines that's true just saying none of that i'm a conspiracy
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:00.940]   you know furbie it's like the furbie it's like the the it's gonna be an ipad christmas didn't
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:06.300]   tim cook say that maybe he has a strategy but also they know they know that they're gonna have a
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:11.740]   run on these devices that on day one of launch even if the day one was in october so you may as well sort
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:16.060]   of if you stretch the two hurricanes for the same day in the same city you may as well have it in the
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:22.540]   same day so does that that means i have to get in line on black friday the the least the time i
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.620]   normally will stay far away from the mall and that'd be awesome but you get five bucks off of hard
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:32.220]   drively let's win win i was hoping a lot
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:39.900]   uh good news ipad air online orders have gone well what is this is this story from november first
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:44.140]   oh this is this is an old story i don't know how this gotten this is the launch story we know about
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:53.820]   that it was that was friday it was five days ago an eternity and eternity and technology time
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:58.140]   ashton kutcher now lead product engineer for linovo
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:04.700]   that should so well at blackberry that should really fix things up did you see that blackberry
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.900]   yeah they've decided what did they decide tell us canadian what did blackberry decide they decided
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.220]   not to be sold off they got a billion dollar loan they got rid of torson hines as a ceo and they
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:20.940]   brought him in that's the new ceo then you see so he's the old new ceo the new new ceo is john
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:28.460]   chan who ran side base and sold it to sap the guy his last jabber ceo was running a software company
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.900]   uh yeah an analytic database company and then they sold it to sap and now he's
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:40.140]   it's they might be doing an enterprise play leo who gave blackberry a billion dollars
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.140]   who who would do that fair facts the same people who are going to buy it they couldn't get enough
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:49.020]   money to buy so i believe they just did an investment why why would you why would you do that
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:56.940]   is there any chance in how blackberry can survive sure i mean what i bm is a huge company doing
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.500]   enterprise services that know it has no sexy consumer face but they still do really good business
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:07.020]   so as long as you have technology and is it the success of blackberry messenger on android
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:13.020]   and iphone that has given people this buoyant feeling about the future of blackberry is that what it is
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.140]   but is it is and is the messenger as secure as the blackberry it's not at all it's the same so it's
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.980]   you know having it there i mean i think that the the reason people use it is for security and i
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:27.100]   think that they use it because they're high school buddies use it right or originally used it because
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:32.700]   you're on wall street and then you had family or people who have a wall street or government but
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.620]   also it has a lot of the same features that my upper soft office has and windows has it's not
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:41.580]   just the features of the software itself it's also the fact that if you need to hire up some people
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:46.460]   that can support your your your mobile infrastructure you can find people who know how to who know how
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.100]   to make blackberry messenger and blackberry servers uh service software work and they're a lot less
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:56.700]   expensive you don't have to retrain exactly so i i think that i i i've no i have no idea if the
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.700]   company's worth a billion dollars but it certainly has a certain amount of value i wrote a column
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.940]   for the sun times last week that was uh that was talked about that sort of stuff and i wondered that
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.980]   if they decided to simply say you know we got clobbered by this whole concept of bringing
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:16.300]   our own device what if we decided to really embrace that and we will we will release our own uh android
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.460]   based launcher that will essentially turn any android 4.1 phone into a blackberry and we'll also have
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:27.260]   access the entire android app library so we can have this really cool enterprise-dudly phone that
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:33.420]   will also do facebook that will also do fruit ninja uh but we can now take all the the hair
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.820]   pulling stuff of manufacturing hardware and let other people you know fight for scraps we will
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.860]   just do that we will just push electrons for the rest of our lives they should have heard you
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   for cpo yeah yeah they're putting out the chatroom rightly the government blocked uh linovo from
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.980]   bidding they didn't want linovo to own it and i don't know if that's because they're chinese or
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.980]   because of ashton kuchir but it could really go either way ashton kuchir could have been the
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:03:02.700]   ceo but no maybe that's why linovo ash also they they have they have alicia keys blackberry has
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.620]   alicia keys they have nail game and working for them uh that's pretty good if you if all if all
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.220]   if all that happens is you get to meet alicia keys nail game and that's got to be worked
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.220]   with at least 80 million right there what is neil doing what is neil himself doing
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:20.140]   oh he was the for uh launch of blackberry tent he did a creative project where he basically had
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.860]   people's tweet like what is what is your best memory of november and then he would write he
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:30.060]   wrote 12 short stories based on the months of the year and then solicited people to do art based on
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.540]   it and it was you know you go to the blackberry site somewhere and download it as a big pdf and
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.660]   it's it's really quite brilliant you know they have their new z 30 fablet on the market now so i
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:45.340]   think it tied in with that long i didn't even know that that was blackberry and z 10 i think
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.660]   the 10 they have z 10 z 30 school the numbers keep going up lee
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:55.020]   again again they have they have so many hit products out there they just kind of blur together
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.060]   in my that's it this is the fifth of the november remember remember the fifth of november
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:04.380]   is that because what guy fox burnt down or tried to blow up the parliament building but failed
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:11.260]   uh patrick rothvis uh had a contest last month did you know that i did not know yeah twitter
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:17.660]   contest he asked people to pose is patrick rothvis on twitter and then had the fans vote
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:25.180]   on patrick rothvis the author of one of our favorite uh books uh the name of the wind
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:32.860]   uh and uh he so then he had a people vote on who was the real patrick rothvis and he lost
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:40.940]   uh he the winner was uh another science fiction writer mary robinette kawal
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.060]   the author of shades of milk and honey she posed as patrick underscore rothvis
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:53.260]   uh there was not patrick rothvis there was fake patrick rothvis our own veronica bellmont was
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:05:01.020]   the real pat rothvis she got nine percent of the vote um patrick rothvis own assistant
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:06.300]   amanda got fourteen percent of the vote patrick rothvis himself the actual patrick rothvis fifteen
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:12.620]   percent of the voters said that's him there's a lot of jim dal rimples in those photos
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.060]   patrick rothvis happens to look just like jim dal rimple that's why
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.100]   isn't that funny then this was all for charity but i i think a great idea
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.700]   great but isn't it funny that the that uh the science fiction author got 42
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:32.220]   who's not patrick rothvis the woman mary got 42 percent of the votes they wanted her to be married
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:36.460]   best buy says hey we were all worried about you know what showrooming is
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:42.620]   that's where you go to a best buyer somewhere else to figure out what washing machine a guy by
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:47.980]   and then you order it on amazon yep and everybody was very worried that people would do this best
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.220]   buy says you know what it's not a problem and guess what they figured out hey we at least have
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.700]   people in the store maybe there's some way to convert them into customers it's crazy what a
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.740]   thought maybe we'll have people who actually know what they're talking about what a thought have
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.780]   service well you know what happens when i walk into a store like that and i get great service
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:09.180]   number one is it's a lot it is easier some of the time to just go in on trying to figure something
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:14.380]   out and just talk to them and i do feel somewhat um obliged to buy from them at that point you know i
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:21.020]   i feel you know obligation yeah yeah it's a traditional sales technique if you go to kyro
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.860]   they pull you in and they give you a cup of tea right and they say have a nice
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:30.060]   no no no i'm not gonna sell you a carpet just relax yeah have a cup of tea would you like something
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.260]   to eat and by the time you're done you got to buy a carpet yep we got a when we were in venice we
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:40.060]   got a free trip to morano to see the glass factories they had the glass blower come out give a whole
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.180]   demonstration then they took you on a tour of the factory in the showroom by the time you're done
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.780]   four thousand dollars in glassware later it works that's how they do uh timesharing
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:57.820]   st. Martin same thing i didn't i didn't get one but you cannot buy a timeshare on amazon yet uh yeah
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:07.340]   just yeah uh the new ceo at uh best buy was actually very smart uh mike mikeen uh said he he said i'm
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:12.780]   gonna make showrooming a success for us very smart price matching customer service improvements
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.620]   their profit has increased shares of sort well and one of the things i think that that a lot of
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.260]   them could do is for instance building an app that allows you to get a lot more information you know
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:26.700]   scan a scan a QR code and get more information um you know and and have an target is putting free
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.420]   Wi-Fi in their stores just for that reason right because they realized they're used to be in fact
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.180]   you still see source no but you can't bring your camera phone and take pictures in here right
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.820]   because they're so afraid target said no come on in well and and we you know that was one of the
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:44.540]   things that uh when i books first came out we got approached by a very big box company and say
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.980]   what would you do with the i books with you know with our showrooms and everything else and we were
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.740]   like well we would uh um you know the uh you know get something out there so people can get more
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.940]   information about all the goods you go into it you watch all these tv's and i don't know which i
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.340]   don't know if i don't know about tv's if i'm not robert haren or i can't email robert right like
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.420]   you need to go online i need to find out like what what what should i be looking for what is
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:11.260]   why is tenety p important why is two hundred forty hurts important why is you know why are all
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.340]   these things important and and you want to have all that information and you want to do that with
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:21.100]   whether it's tv's or faucets or or fishing lines or you know whatever it is you want to be able to
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.060]   get all that information and that's going to make you much more likely to be there because now you're
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.860]   touching it and getting the information you had and if you then move the purchase so say hey
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   by the way do you want that right now and and i can and they can mail it to you have the reason i don't
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.420]   buy stuff i don't want to take it home i don't want to put it in the car
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.780]   when usually i'm somewhere else like i'm in new york and i i look at something this is great
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.340]   and i'm i i'm just worried that's what they did in the glass factory right we'll ship it you know
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:51.500]   um well and also now amazon is no longer has its uh or is starting to lose its uh
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.660]   advantage with sales tax starting to collect sales tax in many states soon we'll be able to
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.500]   do it has not really been that big of a the shipping cost or big yield of a percent well shipping
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.180]   and free shipping because i'm prime member i still buy a lot of stuff i don't but i i guess here's
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:08.300]   things i like that i don't you know i like that it's not calculated whatever but i pain taxes on it
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.060]   is not the reason that i buy from amazon people still look at the price point and that but that's why
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.380]   this is good for consumers because it makes everybody more competitive you assume an intelligent
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.020]   consumer now you've got a match in fact that's uh walmart did they and it wasn't a big deal but
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:27.420]   they dropped 20 bucks off the price of the ipad air for 79 and what is the response apple best by
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:33.340]   staples and target all said all right we'll match right it's good for us right we all benefit from
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:40.700]   that um so i'm glad to see it competition is good for consumers and and apparently if you
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:46.860]   what a concept you have a beautiful store with knowledgeable sales people and products people
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.260]   want they actually buy it there well and and that's really the future of brick and mortar is you
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.700]   you have to you have to have great service you have to have something unique as well i mean we're
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:58.700]   i i don't know if i i'm gonna talk this a long time ago but we were i was at a coffee shop in
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:03.900]   pittsburgh that the beehive that is catacorn or two a starbucks so beehive been there for a long
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.260]   time and the starbucks opened right across the street and i asked him how that affected business he
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.500]   goes oh we've expanded two times you know and he goes people go to the starbucks and then they see
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.460]   this crazy artsy um coffee shop and they walk over and they never go back to starbucks and he goes
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:21.660]   you know but but he provides a very unique experience yeah you know high quality coffee and and you
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.860]   know and and and just a fun place to be and people are always going to choose that but you can't what
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.940]   you can't do is have a mediocre coffee shop and expect starbucks to move in next to you and and
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:36.620]   survive you know right yeah all right we're going to move on get our picks of the week and a second

[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:03.420]   picks of the week i'm gonna get and he's first just in case uh they call your name
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:11.020]   i've been pre packing uh this is not there's there's been a lot of really cool new styluses for the
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:16.460]   iPad that use bluetooth uh low energy to because you know the iPad doesn't have a pressure sensitive
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:23.020]   screen uh and also you always have a basically you always have a limitation of it's looking for
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.580]   something about the size of your fingertip to uh as a sensor sort of thing so that limits like the
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.340]   utility of what you can do with it uh but we're seeing some bluetooth ones that have some really
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:36.540]   clever solutions to solve those problems uh this is from adonut and this is called the jot script
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:43.580]   and it has a really cool feature in that it is exactly like a ballpoint pen so if you are
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:49.980]   someone who takes handwritten notes with your iPad uh there is nothing that in least in my hand
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:55.340]   feels as much as like a regular natural writing instrument than this it is bluetooth it runs off
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:02.380]   of one triple a battery it will run with pretty much any app that's out there uh adonut came out with
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.260]   a software development toolkit so that if you if you're a developer and you support the sdk for
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:14.540]   this device it will be the tracking becomes moves from very very good to almost the as precise as
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:19.580]   the width of this tip uh and that's how good that's how good it becomes there's already a bunch of
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.100]   really great apps available for it this one as a matter of fact has you can see the uh the uh
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:31.740]   evernote logo on it because it is actually because penultimate is actually set up uh to run which is
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.540]   an evernote owned app is set up to run with this specifically so again if you're someone who
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.740]   use doesn't use necessarily for art but for actually writing down notes and diagram does
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.660]   someone speaks or has your thinking this is great the only feature it doesn't have compared to
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.740]   some of the other bluetooth that styluses is that this is not pressure sensitive and adonut does
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:54.460]   make a different version of this that has a very different sort of form factor that is pressure
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.700]   sensitive so if you're using if you're using your stylus for artwork maybe you don't want to get
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.460]   this one but again if you're the person in the conference room who wants to be able to take
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:07.660]   notes on an ipad this will do it for you one thing i forgot to mention too is that if the
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:13.020]   developers is supporting the toolkit that adonut creates for this it also you works with a palm
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:17.260]   rejection as well so you can actually have your palm resting on the surface of the ipad while
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:21.900]   you're writing and it won't like confuse where the tip of the thing is um this is not cheap it's
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:28.780]   about 75 bucks but it's a nice it's it has a good weight to it it's made out of a nice aluminum to
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:34.140]   it it feels like a very high quality product i wish that it had sort of a clip on it so that
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:38.700]   you could easily pocket it i wish it had a little bit of grip at grippiness here at the business
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:43.260]   end of it it doesn't have that but other than that this is the only scott stylus i've ever seen that
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:49.020]   would actually make me want to use my ipad as a handwritten notes taking device the other ones
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:17:00.380]   make it sort of possible this one makes it actually desirable nate adonut.net if you want to take a
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.820]   look at it and the particular one that Andy's talking is the jot script ever note edition 7499
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.060]   i like that i don't need the pressure sensitive from just writing i don't in fact that that would
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:16.700]   be a negative i just want to write and he will let you go he's gone he's got to go to a flight mr
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:22.140]   rene richie i'm more dot com what's your pick this week i'll first i'll echo andy's pick i love both
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.700]   the adonut jot series and the pogo stylus is for different reasons the adonut ones are just like
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.980]   when i was in drafting classes in school fantastic feel and the jots are really nice sorry and the
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:37.260]   the pogo is a really nice for brushwork both fantastic stylus is my pick though it should
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:41.900]   come as no surprise to anybody i don't use a lot of apps daily but i do use this one it's
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:48.940]   fantastical too it's a new version of fantastical um it has been completely rewritten for ios 7
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:53.820]   it now integrates with reminders as well as calendars because it's an open api for reminders
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:58.540]   it's still michael simmons and um voice is gonna mess up ken's last name ken sotherland
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:04.460]   designed by wolf gang bettlemies fantastic designer icon by the icon factory david land i'm of course
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:10.460]   you know great looking stuff great working stuff the scrolling is fantastic um i hate
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.020]   calendars i don't like using calendars i hate the idea of managing my information taking more
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:20.540]   time than actually doing the stuff that it's managing uh and i don't use the ios calendar
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.140]   because it never struck me as an app that steve jobs never used because he would have thrown it
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:30.460]   somebody's head after two minutes but fantastical is great it's so fast to get stuff into it uses
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:35.100]   natural language the way syri does but through typing instead of through speech so you just type
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.540]   a sentence exactly what they're showing in the video lunch with elan and it just goes right in
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:43.020]   there but also when you're out and about you're trying to find something they've got a bidirectional
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.580]   scroller you can scroll through the day ticker on the top uh and the list on the bottom and it's
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:53.740]   just so fast to find something um using fantastical and because it's using the universal
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:58.220]   reminders and calendar database if you're using iCloud you know if you're one of those people who
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.380]   just happen to set up iCloud for calendars it'll sync everything and that includes you know to
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:07.260]   fantastical on the mac but to the default calendar apps as well if you have to use them somewhere
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:11.820]   or if you're using an iPad that doesn't happen to have fantastical on it fantastical on it yet
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:17.900]   so it's really quick really beautifully designed the ios 7 version looks really clean um the
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:24.860]   reminders integration is fantastic um he had me at hello with with this app i was really happy about
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:29.100]   there an iPad version or it looks like there's only an iPhone version there's an iPhone and
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:33.660]   mac version it's really interesting when you talk to a lot of developers the iPhone is this device
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:38.380]   that you use quickly while you're on the go to get things in and get things out and the mac is
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:42.620]   this device that when you're sitting down it's just so quick and powerful to enter a lot of stuff
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:47.660]   that the iPad sort of sits in between and yes it's good for reporting or aggregation but it almost
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:53.020]   ends up being a third priority for productivity apps just because the iPhone and the mac are so
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:57.740]   such clear such clearly different things you can run the iPhone version on the iPad of course but
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.380]   because it syncs you can also run any other calendar app you want there and it works just fine
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:07.340]   you know it's funny that you should do this because i got two calls this weekend on the radio show
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:12.220]   from people who upgraded ios 7 and hated the calendar app so much they said save me i want to
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:18.140]   roll back is there anything better and i'd said fantastical so and i think it would be really nice
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:23.420]   to have an iPad version because yes for data entry you use the phone or the desktop and i use the
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:29.260]   fantastical has a menu bar and nothing that makes it very easy to enter on the mac but i also want a
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:35.020]   big display on my iPad i mean there's a place in the iPad for a calendar display right i mean
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:39.020]   that's usable and with all that real estate you could really have a nice calendar display so
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:44.460]   i think there is a reason to make an iPad version i will keep bugging about it i you know i've i've
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.380]   been on the beta for fantastical for a long time so i've been using the new version for a while
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:53.180]   it's held up really well it's got a new uh you can you can rotate it to landscape to get the
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:57.980]   weak view now which is new and it's just a lot of great new features really really well put together
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:05.260]   yeah fantastical version two for the iPhone and they're still fantastical one for at the desktop
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.900]   in the apps yeah fantastical two is a new app which does bug some people but it's you know it's
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:13.500]   months and months of work on their part and i'll throw them you know three dollars yeah
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:20.860]   even you know these things are so cheap i see no reason yeah yeah uh moving along to your pick of
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:26.780]   the week mr uh Alex i'm streaming live why are you doing that because for fun see you're on youtube live
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:31.740]   right now right here so if you go to if you go to yeah i want to be on your show right there we go
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.940]   you're on my show can i be on your show yeah so here it is let's see if i click on it here the um uh
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:43.100]   so this is uh youtube live of course if you have more than uh if you plug in i think they can see
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:49.580]   we have now it because we both have htmi connectors on our laptops how can you mix it so simple
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:56.700]   to just plug in and in a moment have i crashed your machine possibly no no in a moment we'll see
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:04.940]   else yeah you see that there jet no no no i thought it was really easy when we had to get set up
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:10.540]   before well we can show it over the shoulder if you want so the all i was gonna so what basically
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:16.620]   um if you have more than a hundred subscribers in youtube um to your channel you can for free stream
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.220]   live so there's a little lag i just started waving it's 42 seconds or so behind um the uh
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:29.980]   um because it's it's re-encoding so you can you can stream in 1080p for free to youtube um right now
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:35.340]   uh and it's and all you need is a hundred subscribers to your to your channel which you know um it used
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:39.500]   to be at first it was you had to be very special then you had to have a thousand and then you had
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:43.580]   to have a hundred and so it's gotten easier and easier and easier as they've gotten better the
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:49.260]   the interface to starting running managing your your live streaming is pretty much in in my opinion
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.340]   the best in the business or one of the best in the business as far as just being nice and easy and
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.620]   it's a huge infrastructure and you can you get a lot of the tools that you would get that are
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:01.100]   industrial you can i can send i can do a primary stream backup stream so and so forth and about
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:06.380]   nine you ninety five percent of our live events are all on youtube here's why the the app though that
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.180]   i'm talking about the pick is not youtube live which is amazing it's wirecast for youtube which
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:17.820]   is free so um so wirecast is of course uh a software uh encoder but they have a free version
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:23.500]   that you can use with youtube and um let me shoot and i don't know if i have the the brand new version
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.100]   of this i think they they might have just changed it but uh yeah this is check out the new one so
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:31.820]   this is slightly older one but but you definitely worth checking out so if you get live enabled um
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:36.460]   what you can do is essentially you can have up to three cameras um you know that you can be cutting
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:41.660]   in between if you have the inputs uh they can be webcams they can be so you can literally do this with
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:47.660]   with webcams to stream to youtube um there we go someone's uh there um and uh and then the
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.020]   setup is basically the same setup in a lot of ways that you would have there there you go now if you
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:55.660]   go down to there and say what encoder you're using so you select encoder oop there's there's the there's
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:01.180]   the level so you can say tenety p and then you can say select encoder and there's a wirecast for youtube
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.860]   and then i'll tell you to download it and you can download it right there there you go there's mac
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:09.100]   r windows and um and then you can install it and it will give you a couple different options now of
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.740]   course the cool thing about this is is as you want to have more features wirecast there's a studio version
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:19.340]   there's a pro version so you can keep on upgrading and adding more bits but um you know with uh you
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:23.740]   know with the very basic version you don't have to know anything about encoding settings and
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:29.660]   ingest points and anything else it just it just does it you know and so uh it is a really really
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:34.620]   easy way for people to get into live streaming um and now that it's so easy uh i mean as far as
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.180]   it's cheap it's you know it's something that i would definitely suggest um anyway so that's
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:46.140]   that's my pick wirecast for youtube very cool let's do it hi
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:52.540]   and in 42 seconds it'll be there yeah later which is cool just so you know why it's 42 seconds it's
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:57.500]   taking a 10 720p stream here and slicing it up into four different resolutions and then putting
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.900]   it up all for you and so so you can watch it on your phone and everything else and so it's not
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:07.660]   something that that used to be very um when i used to do it uh we're all day old days we're very
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:11.420]   crumple-care make them you make a lot of money showing people how to do that yeah shouldn't knock
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:17.980]   it they're making it too easy and you knock it off youtube uh we are out of time but we uh do thank
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:23.260]   you very much Renee Richie imore.com that's the place to go for all the i guess we won't have to
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:28.460]   worry about rumors now for a few months i hope we all need a vacation you know what i need i need
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:34.860]   a mac pro and i need an ipad many uh i mean yeah ipad mini with red display it was nice apple let us
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:38.860]   you know split up our purchases you can buy one thing in october one thing in no one thing in
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:44.460]   November from the red nam december that's probably why they did it huh so you think black friday
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:50.380]   it could it when apple says late in the month i generally think it's the last possible minute of
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.940]   the last possible day in the last possible month yeah that's late in the month means the 20 oh and
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.260]   they're charro informed us leo that apple is put up its information government request pdf just
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:06.860]   moments ago okay detailing what they did with the nsa asking for information from the government
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:11.580]   or they actually say this is the result report on government information request november 5th
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:17.020]   2013 it's a pdf file protecting personal data advocating for greater transparency
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.900]   requests from law enforcement it's dull tables and lot of text but if you're interested it's what
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.940]   they did it and that's what matters they didn't put it on their front page i might point out
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:31.260]   reporting that that's a lot so this is something google does too where they
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:37.020]   actually they are they give you numbers here yeah they do they're giving us numbers of as to how
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:43.100]   many requests there are by country google google did this uh first and i think this kind of transparency
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   is a very valuable way of keeping these government requests um you know a little a little bit in
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.460]   public instead of just behind the scenes the united states the total number of law enforcement
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:59.580]   account requests receive they can't say actual numbers they could do ranges somewhere between
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:05.980]   one and two thousand the number of accounts specified in the request somewhere between two
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:11.020]   and three thousand the number of accounts for which data was closed somewhere between zero and a
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:16.060]   thousand the number of account requests were apple objected somewhere between zero and a thousand
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:22.860]   this is worthless for the u.s anyway uh number of account requests were non-content data was
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:28.620]   to close somewhere between zero and a thousand and i'm fascinated as we as we really watch this
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:33.260]   rollout is the just the incredible impact that snowed in his head on the whole yeah the whole
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.860]   process because these guys were dealing with this all you know without being able to say anything
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.660]   and suddenly it's all something that can't be hidden anymore and by the way uh edward snowed
