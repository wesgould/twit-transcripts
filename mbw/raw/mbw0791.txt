[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   It's time for Mac break weekly. Yes, I'm back. Thank you, Micah Sargent for filling in last week.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:17.280]   Renee Ricci is here. Andy Inacos here. So is Alex Lindsey. The whole team is in town. We're going to talk about the M1 Pro and the M1 Max Renee interviewed some top Apple execs and has some insight.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.400]   John Louie Gase has a plan for Apple. It doesn't involve cars. It doesn't involve 3D or augmented reality. What does it involve?
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.200]   And we'll take a look at some new features in iOS 15.2. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover, the latest news from Apple. Hello everybody, I'm back.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.120]   I'm sorry I missed you last week, but I hear the show was excellent in my STEM. In fact,
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:20.560]   unfortunately all the shows went better without me. So hey Andy and I go good to see you. Congratulations on your coup at the opera.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   I don't know. I attended the opera in Boba Fett cosplay and I was not thrown out even once.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.440]   So that was a I put that in the wind column. Let me show people what you what you looked like. You were smart because you played it cool.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.880]   You weren't like wearing a metal helmet and at a man he a armor. You were in a nice suit.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.320]   In my mind I was. That's all it cost.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   And how and how was turn dough? Turned out was a palisite delight. Christine Gurkey as always.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.320]   That was I was there a to cosplay on Halloween weekend, but also this was like the second or
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   third time I tried to see Christine Gurkey for the soprano, dramatic soprano saying and boy was she amazing. I told Andy his autobiography should be cosplaying at the Met.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.560]   There you go. It's also very the lead.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:26.240]   Also, Mr. Alex Lindsey is here from office. My only question for Andy was was he able to catch a solo. That's that's the only thing.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   Oh, I get it. There you go. The solo shot first. I get it. There you go. I get it. I'm here all week.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   Great to see you, Alex. Also good to be here. Also joining us. Also joining us. Renee Richie, Renee, Rich, YouTube.com/Renee Richie. Good to see you.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   Have you been having much fun with your M1 MacBook Pros?
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.880]   Leo, I got to talk for like an hour to the vice president of Apple Silicon. I'm going to be on a high for a month. He's coming down anytime soon.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.360]   Who says that said Johnny Suruji or who is that? No, it's yours for Johnny, Tim. Tim.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   Tim.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.520]   He was you've seen. Yeah, you've seen him on the
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.400]   I'm gonna mispronounce his last name. You've seen him on the on the keynote to work. He was one who introduced the A14 last year on the
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.480]   Nice. Tim Malay. That's the right way to announce it. Did you get a lot of
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.960]   Dietz a little inside information?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:34.160]   So I had him and Tom Bogar. Tom Bogar is vice president of iPad and Mac product marketing. But also he's 27 year veteran. He's been working on the Mac for
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.520]   almost three decades. He loves it. I think like it's one of his children. It's great to hear the
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.480]   but also like they talked about how they how they did a lot of it. For example, you get
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.360]   up to 64 gigabytes of RAM to keep the CPUs fed but also 400 gigabits per second bandwidth to keep the GPUs fed.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.320]   But since it's a unified architecture, the GPUs get that
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:03.600]   get that memory which almost never happens on a notebook and the CPUs get that bandwidth which just never happens anywhere and it resulted in sort of these these removal of bottlenecks
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.080]   that are really interesting. And for me personally, they also when you have rendering engines now off the main CPU cores on my old Intel machine, if I pressed render
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.080]   I could barely use a web browser. Now I press render is like I have another Mac free to do everything else. Oh, that's nice. It was really fascinating. Oh, that's really sweet.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.920]   Yeah, I was looking forward to testing those out but our set got returned to Apple because FedEx couldn't figure out where we were.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:37.760]   I'll just I figured out, you know what everybody else has got there. So by now I think we'll use their reviews and Anthony can just keep using that old Intel i9 MacBook Pro 16 for a little bit longer.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:49.120]   I think maybe actually it's a blessing in disguise because maybe it's worth waiting for the desktop versions the M1 mini mini's. Yeah.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:06:02.080]   We heard some rumors about those two where they're going to have two diversions maybe in the iMac and four diversions in the Mac Pros. If you imagine M1 Max times four with that sort of unified architecture behind it.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.400]   Are they going to have 128 gigabytes of RAM? They're what are they going to do? The pro the pro the pro the max the pro max the pro max max.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:20.320]   No, I think it's either extreme or a store quad and do I think just gonna call M1 Max like a dual M1 Max and quad. Yeah. Yeah. I think they should just use UBA.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:31.200]   We'll see. Yeah. I wonder. Will they all be on the same die or will they be the same package for die two dies or four dies and then the same package which just means so much fabric.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:40.720]   So it will be unified memory for both cores or all cores or how I'm guessing you'll have one package of unified memory poor per die.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:52.080]   I'd love to see what they do here because in the interview that I did they explain how it was non trivial to make an architecture that would support that much unified memory already on the on the M1 Max.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.960]   So having to do that but there is apparently a bunch of like IP switches and things already on these chips that show where the inter the interlinks would go.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.840]   Oh, which I think is also interesting. All you need is an electron microscope and some free to use it.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   That's that's really exciting. I mean, I think there's a lot of headroom for the platform.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   The information said it's going to be difficult for Intel to catch up. They they they speculated or maybe they got an inside story.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:33.920]   On their roadmap but because of Apple's plans for its future Mac processors, these new chips are according to the information Wayne Ma writing likely to easily outperform Intel's future processors.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.800]   Elder like is out or at least out enough so we've got benchmarks and stuff and that's a very nice looking processor.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   I love the the people say, all their lake is faster than the M1 Max on desktop.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:55.120]   So, well, it's faster than AMD as well. But like the biggest issue with all the lake is that Intel just they wanted to beat AMD.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:03.440]   That is the only thing they cared about the entire specification sheet for all the lake said, please beat AMD for the for the benchmark LARP community.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.720]   Like as long as we can get the kids to post a few more points, that's all we care. And they did it at the power levels that they're pushing like you can push voltage.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.240]   You can push frequency. You can put voltage.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   One just to give you a comparison, M1 Max is 30 watts with all the CPUs at maximum.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.080]   Elder Lake starts at 100 watts on baseline.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.400]   Goes to 200 watts for max goes to 330 watts for overclock.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.520]   Just to see.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   Is there though, and I think this is important to ask obviously in a laptop, it matters.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.560]   But is there a reason to worry about TPU on a desktop? I mean, throw all the power you want.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   Yes. So, sometimes, so Dave to teach it a video where he got the chips from Intel,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.480]   he was super happy to put them in his 1 TX case and he couldn't. Like he said, there was no physical way to cool those to in a mini tower case.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.840]   He had to put in a water cooler just to use the i5 and the i7, the i9 version of those chips.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.000]   So if you care about, well, environmentally the power, but whatever, like I'm not going to discount that.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   But if you'd like to say you have tons of power that's on an issue, you can't get the casing that you want.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   You're limited to casings that have either massive thermal envelopes or you're going to have to go through the process of water cooling or using alternative cooling methods,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.280]   which is not trivial for mainstream computer.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.680]   Okay.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.440]   The alien where that he got, they sent him the alien where with it pre-built and it throttled immediately and hard.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.960]   So even the consumer versions.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.680]   Yeah, I have a 59, and a 5900 rise it in my alien wearing it.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.440]   Sounds like a jet engine taking off.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.200]   But I just put on headphones.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.440]   I don't care if it's hot.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.600]   Get as hot as getting that performance.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.000]   But that affects performance because you can't have both.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.360]   You can't have peak performance in a thermally constrained environment.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.720]   As anyone will tell Mac.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.880]   Even on a desktop, you're going to have that issue.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.840]   Okay.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   Unless you find a way to cool it.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:56.240]   And the other thing is that Apple, of course, with desktop machines can increase the power that they use as well.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.040]   And potentially get more out of some of the future chips.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.600]   You know, so or future desktops.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.480]   So it's kind of like right now, Apple's like, you know, I'm only laughing because I'm really not left handed.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.160]   No, nope.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.960]   And it can be sure that they're not going to do a desktop with passive cooling again.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   They're going to try to eke as much performance out of this as possible.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.280]   I mean, I definitely think that when we get to the Mac Pro in a year and a half or so,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.880]   it is they're going to want to make a point like it's going to be screaming fast.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.640]   The informations leak says three nanometer process.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   So that also helps keeping it cool and getting more.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.680]   And getting free.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.080]   That's pretty small.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.800]   And that'll be a 16 as well.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.000]   And that'll benefit because the iPhone, the nice thing about these series that they're in lockstep with the iPhone and Apple,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.680]   because they use scalable architecture, whatever they put, the iPhone is a huge money maker.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.920]   So they can afford to put a lot of R&D behind that that they then get to use in their desktops,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.360]   which is kind of super smart.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.040]   And that's going to go down to three nanometers. It'll be R&V9 almost assuredly.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   And they have to work within the constraints of an iPhone thermal envelope.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.560]   So it will fly even in an iPad, in a MacBook Air is relatively beefy by comparison thermal envelope.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.440]   It is a compromise though to say we're going to put four die on a package.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.960]   Right. I mean,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.600]   it's what Zion does.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.800]   Well, Zion doesn't do in packages.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.840]   Well, I didn't tell I had to do it.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.360]   CPUs had to do it. Yeah. They would have liked to have got faster than five gigahertz,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.440]   but they couldn't. So they just up the number of processors.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.400]   There are disadvantages, I would imagine though.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.520]   Did you talk with the Malia about that?
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.480]   They talked about it in terms of what they've done on the current SLC.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.840]   They're not going to talk about future.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.440]   Yeah. No, but like you look at it, like you look at the code names, for example,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.640]   you have J, which is the M1, then you have J-Chop and J-Dye, which are the M1, Pearl,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.200]   M1 Max, then you have 2C and 4C, which just looks like it's an implementation of those.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.120]   And again, non-trivial, but they've shown how they can scale it up to four pools of
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.760]   unified memory on this. And I don't think it's hard to imagine how they're going to build an
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.200]   infrastructure where they lower the latency and the overhead basically of those four dies
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.960]   talking to each other. Yeah. And still, all of those dies talking to each other is
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.360]   way faster than going out to the bus.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.280]   Yes. You know, like to a traditional bus. And so that's the thing that they'll be able to keep on,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.680]   maybe not in the same level, but continuing to multiply what the power looks like.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.760]   Alex, you don't have any of the maxes yet. Or are you? I don't.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.280]   You're going to get on? I don't. No, I'm waiting to see.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.840]   Because I will be so upset if I buy a laptop is not a form factor I need anymore.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.480]   I mean, I have one and I need it when I need it to go, you know, write some things or whatever.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.800]   But the, you know, I have a bunch of Mac minis I've got, you know, and I'm more
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.000]   interested in like a new iMac than I am in a laptop at this point.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.080]   Yeah. And I'm thinking Anthony, I'm not going to get you an iMac. I'll get you a mini if it has
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.120]   the same capability. Right. Boer Mac Pro if we need to.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.160]   Sorry. I love it. I love you. I love you.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.800]   I love you. You were going to have to wait until the end of the year, even if I ordered one a week ago,
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.160]   just because of the back quarters. So we'll just wait till the desktops come out. That's probably
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.680]   at the latest June, possibly earlier. Yeah. I think June will be the latest. I mean,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.520]   if I was going to put money on it, I'd say March to March. Yeah. Yeah. So hack three more months.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.040]   Maybe Matt's in June because that's like traditional place like the 2013 and 2017 Mac Pro's were
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.000]   2019 Mac Pro's or WWDC. So maybe the iMacs and the Mac minis. Is there any, is there any
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.720]   pros will be next fall? Yeah, yeah, they may be farther out. Is there any concern you have though,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.760]   Alex, about the GPUs that they're including on these chips compared to discrete GPU?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.720]   No, I think it's not apples to apples anymore. I mean, it's a completely different architecture
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.880]   with different, you know, partly because you have so much memory you can address now.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.080]   So I just think that I think that you know, you're gonna have to see in real world,
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   we have to see what is it like when I open this up and what is it like when I open that up.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.720]   Right. And that even doesn't really tell us anything until the code has been really optimized
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.000]   for the chips. Yeah. So so there's a whole bunch of things right now that are very early. It's
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.800]   very hard to make decisions related to this, but I think it's probably going to be a lot faster,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.200]   especially the the apps that are truly built for it. I think it's going to are going to really
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   year into the transition apple silicon. It looks like most of the there are lots of
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.720]   there very few apps left that are not transited. Are there some that you really need that have
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.320]   not had to be as in progress still? Adobe. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of 3D apps
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:42.400]   that are. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of 3D apps that that are not
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.000]   all the way converted yet. Right. You know, and that's those are really hard. You know,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.480]   those are really hard apps that to do both Adobe and a lot of the 3D apps really have a hard time
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.440]   making this conversion because you know, they had the right to metal and they don't want to write
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.960]   to metal. They want to write to open GL. They want to do the things that they've been doing.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.800]   And so so that's that's going to take a long time for them to get like to really move over
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.200]   and take full advantage. And the real opportunity is for the companies that get ahead is to really
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.800]   take a lot of ground. So like Max on is probably way ahead of most of the companies around,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.480]   you know, making that pivot because they're just they just they're code is much more efficient.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.720]   It hurt my heart a little bit when I when Apple said you have to install Rosetta 2 for this app.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.880]   I went, no, I don't want no. No, no, no. There's no one. And as it turns out to see there was a beta
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.320]   version is the mail app I use mailmate. There was a beta version that was native,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.960]   but now that Rosetta 2 is installed, it still kind of pops up from now and now.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.080]   Well, you'll see it anyway, because there are a bunch of stuff that you like Discord is still
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.840]   in Intel app, but there's just like it's hard to get away from it still. I got to see a demo of
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.200]   Octane that was made by Apple's pro workflow team, which has some of all of our favorite
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.800]   ILM and Pixar and other assorted Apple community nerds. And they built an entire scout spaceship.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.720]   It was all HDR. It was 4k and 8k footage. And they turned on everything. It turned on every
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.760]   balance which that they could. And they were manipulating in real time. And the guys like,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.320]   we've just never had this much memory available to a portable GPU before. And he was like a kid
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.840]   in a candy store, which is amazing. The M1 Pro I got because I got the base model because I
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.240]   wanted it in a hurry before I left for Mexico. And I did take it to Mexico with me, put Capture One
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.960]   on it, which is M1 native. That really runs nicely. So does affinity pro and dark room and all the
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.440]   tools that I like. So I feel like it's it's pretty good, but it only had 512 gigs of storage because
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.000]   it was the base model. Actually, I'm surviving. I thought I would I thought I would suffer.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.680]   But I'm just not putting a lot of video files on it. The place that the place is hard is like,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.560]   where do you know, I because I keep my iPhoto's library on an external drive. That's the one that
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.040]   really chews up a lot of space. And then also when you install logic and it wants to put a hundred
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.800]   gigs of sound on your use case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I said. I have big video files and
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.760]   that really the thing that I didn't share with you is they would I will I got the Aterabyte
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   versions and I'm doing a lot of that. And you notice the internal drive is so much faster.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.880]   We talked about this. It is lightning fast. Yeah. And I have NVMe external drives too. And I just
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.720]   don't I'm just clumsy. So I knock them out all the time, but when I need them the most. So it's just
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.440]   I'm saving me from myself. But they also talked about like pro res because they took this the pro
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.080]   res accelerator card, the afterburner from the Mac Pro. It was made by the Apple Silicon team.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.160]   And it was the best that they could do at the time to sort of accelerate pro res because otherwise
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.880]   it just hits the CPU. But they found out now when they put it on die and it goes through
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:42.160]   unified memory, they're outperforming a 28 core Mac Pro with the with the package that's on the
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.760]   new M1 Macs in a laptop because it has immediate access to all of those resources. And because
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   it's no longer on the CPU, like I was saying, it's like you have two computers now. You have a computer
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.480]   that's doing your rendering, your transcoding, any of those big things or your ml if you're using
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.720]   the neural engines instead. And then you have a whole like CPU GPU Mac, you could still use
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.440]   for other stuff at the same time, which to me is the biggest biggest workflow change.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.880]   And it's not just something that is great for the Mac Pro, but also great for pro res
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.240]   because it just becomes one of those things like if you're if you're a reporter or if you're a
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.160]   vlogger or if you're anybody who has to turn video over quickly, this is the ultimate portable
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.800]   device to make that happen and the ultimate format to do it. And so as you start looking at
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.920]   what camera shoot pro res and what, you know, and how do I do that? Because it's the it's going to
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.720]   save an enormous amount of time. Rendering is like the biggest problem that we have generally.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.040]   I also only got 16 gigs of ram and I did run once at least once into that you're out of system
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.280]   memory thing. Was it the bug though? Because it might be a bug. I think it might be a bug.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.680]   Honorary. Yeah. So it's like Michael's be doing it like mail. Yeah. Michael Simon writing for
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.160]   Mac world memory leaks are crippling my M1 MacBook Pro and I'm not alone. I have I wouldn't say
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.640]   crippling. One of the first things that is open activity monitor and remember I only have 16
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:07.440]   gigs noticed that the control center was using 3.2 gigs. So the first thing I did is is kill
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   control center. It went back down to a couple of 100 megs and everything seems to have settled
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.920]   down as a result. I was also using Firefox. I switched back because that was using a lot of
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.440]   memory. I switched back to some mail has been a culprit to some people. Okay. Some of the after
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.760]   effects beta has been terrible. So there so memory leaks can be a big issue. I noticed that it was
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.160]   them and there's more to be patched. Yeah. Yeah. I noticed that if I was using any pre-installed
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.360]   extensions, anything on Rosetta, I was getting memory issues. So you know, and so that's the
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.560]   for me, if everything on the computer and on the two computers that I have, it's now just about
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.760]   everything. One computer is pure. Like literally, I don't have Rosetta on it. I don't want to have
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.520]   and then the other one has a couple things on it. But I found that the memory errors went down a
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   lot when I wasn't using something that wasn't, you know, it's the native stuff was working. For me,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.560]   it's working fine. It's when you start adding the Rosetta stuff that you start seeing memory leaks.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.800]   Our X9 is Rosetta for me. And I like you can see the difference. I press the button on a ProRes
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.640]   encode. It's a 10 minute video. It takes like four minutes. It takes one percent battery life.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.840]   But then I do the same thing with RX9, which is Intel and I can hear the fans come up and say,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.880]   have you checked your control center, Renee? Yeah, I haven't had any, I knock wood. I hesitate
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.160]   saying it. I haven't had a single memory leak yet. Once I force quick, it's fine. It's been
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.640]   fine ever since I keep now, I keep the monitor open just to kind of keep an eye on things.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.320]   And I haven't any problems since. So I think it must have been a bug in control center.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.840]   I know that even even in Catalina, you know, there are some apps that if I push really, really hard,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.760]   even after I close them, I have to restart the computer. Like I just like, like it's not
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.000]   nothing. It's not that I get errors. It's just that nothing runs, right? Like every, like it's
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.480]   something tongue up. And the only way to flush it is to restart it. One other bug we experienced,
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.200]   which is just weird and it may just be me. You know how I love this feature, Apple, when you,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.720]   I was trying to log on to the Wi-Fi at work. And so Apple notified every device,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.240]   because I didn't have the password, share the password with Leo. And I said, yes, on all my
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.840]   devices. But for some reason, I kept doing that to Lisa for a few days. Like every few minutes,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.080]   it'll pop up. You want to share your password with Leo. And until I rebooted, it continued. So just,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   but rebooting did fix it. Seem, and Lisa, tell me if you're still getting it, but I think it,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.600]   I haven't heard from Merno a couple of days about that anyway. So I think that that's okay. So
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:35.760]   another just, you know, you can expect some of these things, I guess. Memory leaks, you know,
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.960]   if they're in an Apple software, well, I expect them to go away very quickly. If they're in third
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.280]   party software, that's another matter entirely. Also Dropbox, I said they'll finally update me
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.600]   next year. I've been using Maestro instead of try Google Drive and I'm using Maestro
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.920]   now instead of the Dropbox. But does it work with Dropbox? It's a third party. Okay.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.440]   Yeah, it's a third party. You put in the key and it just where it's very bare bones. There's
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.840]   a command line if you'd like it, Leo, but for some things, Dropbox, I can live with that.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.080]   I can live with that Dropbox, to be honest with you. I'm trying.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.760]   I'm trying. Dropbox wasn't working. Would you know?
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:14.400]   I would. I'm trying to get it all everything off. The hardest part with Dropbox is that once
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   you have like terabytes of stuff on Dropbox, which I did, I accumulated over years,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.800]   getting it off the web is not trivial. You know, like it's, you know, it's hard to.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.640]   Oh my gosh. Yeah, but Mike has sent me a share request or a file request and I had to use it.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.680]   But that's, you know, and then you just close it out. I just did it in the web. I didn't,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.960]   I didn't install the Dropbox. Oh, I definitely don't install. I haven't installed that for years,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.560]   but I even in the web trying to get it all off the web after that is a thing.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.280]   You know, so it's, I feel like I have to set up a whole computer just to like pair it up
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.680]   and then let it sit for two weeks and have it all pull it down and then turn it off because it's
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.280]   just, you know, I'm trying to switch to Google Drive, see how that goes.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.880]   Oh, I don't, well, I mean, I have to do that. So I do all my transfers with frame.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.160]   So frame my, oh, I just like it's, it's, uh, it's so much faster than everything else.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.720]   Like the, it's saturated. We could do non-video on frame because like, oh, yeah, I share everything.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.400]   I share everything. I share everything. Yeah. It just as it can't prove you the model, but I,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:16.480]   I put up USD Z models and PDFs and, uh, you know, anything, it'll take anything that you want to
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.840]   put up there. It just will only play back the video. I would much rather give money to the people
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.880]   who gave every money than give money to them. Well, frame is just really, it's super, super easy
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.040]   to use, um, and, uh, and control and put into folders and, and, uh, pull down all those things.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.080]   Yeah. It's just really tough. When you do, you really have to do an audit every once in a
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.800]   while to figure out exactly how much storage you're paying for across so many different services.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.440]   I bet, I think the last time I tried to do that, I've realized that I have about four terabytes of
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.120]   storage I'm paying for across like three or four different services, including, uh, Adobe's for,
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.360]   uh, cloud storage of photos for Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop. And I would love to consolidate
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   that all into one. And the thing is like Dropbox does some things better than Google Drive,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.600]   but I love like the pricing plan and the accessibility of Google Drive for all these other things that
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.160]   I'm doing. And it's hard to sort of quit them all because it's, it's like you have three different
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.320]   kinds of really, really hot spices in your cupboard because sometimes you want the rooster pace,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.960]   sometimes you want the chili powder, sometimes you want the habaneros and you don't know which one
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.280]   you're going to need it. Anyone give me a surprising none of you mentioned iCloud. I'm sure iCloud's
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.720]   M1 ready. No, it's great. People keep telling me that. They get super mad at me for not talking
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.440]   about it, but it's great if you're a person or a family. It is not great if you're doing anything
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.080]   that involves like shared business stuff. Any other persons in the world because not everybody,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.160]   I mean, Mac user, like you can share a phone and you can share a few things.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.800]   Right. Yeah. I mean, the one I don't know. You think you're living, you're living large use in
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:57.600]   frame and then you find out that Sony MCS exists. It is really, what is that? Yes, it's like, oh,
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.960]   set the professional media control center. Yeah, it is. So you can send invites from folders,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.880]   you know, like just upload to here. And so this is the big guns. You know, like,
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:20.720]   I feel like frame is really comfortable and it's probably less expensive. So I'm still using
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:26.160]   frame, but I feel like when I grow up, I might try Sony MCS. Frame I/O is noted mostly though
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.600]   for its workflow in the cloud. Right. Well, what frame? Yeah, yeah, it's got a lot of workflows.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.960]   It doesn't have the same integrate. It doesn't, I don't know if it has the same, all the same
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.640]   feedback things. I mean, I think that the big thing with frame is I can upload things to clients.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.880]   They can start putting in comments immediately into the videos and that really sets it apart.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.600]   And then I can those notes go back into Final Cut or Resolve or whatever you're using as markers.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.280]   So when they put the notes, you just go to the next marker and fix the problem and you literally
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.400]   click on the marker, it opens up and says, I don't want that logo and you're like, okay,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.040]   I'll take that logo out and then you're done. And then you can check it off saying I did it.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.640]   And then it goes back to the web page and says he did that. He did that. And so you can,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:12.160]   it's just how it's tied into the entire ecosystem is amazing. But you can also up to up, like just
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.600]   up to any file. I use it for my general file transfer. That's just how I get things to people
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.920]   because the other thing it does is it saturates your line. So when you upload something, just
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.440]   don't do it when someone else is trying to run a live show or something because it just sucks.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.840]   The whole like if you have, if you have a gig is going to use all of it to get there,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:34.320]   you know, to get all the files up. So it's nice and fast, but it is a bully within your network.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.120]   Let's take a little break. We come back. That's all the exciting news. Now there's just the rest
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.280]   of the news. It's still good. It's still good stuff. There's still lots to talk about. I just,
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.560]   you know, we always like talking about toys. I guess we can talk about
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.320]   - When you shiny these - Monterey, because now that we've had it for a couple of weeks,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.400]   we could talk a little bit about that and iOS 15.1 is coming and stuff like that. I'll show
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.760]   today brought to you by the fresh air in our studio. Let me tell you after those fires,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.680]   that's the one you all saw the pictures where the the sun was blood red hanging over San Francisco.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:18.560]   It was it was tough. Fortunately, even back then we were using molecule air purifiers and we could
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:25.760]   breathe in here, not outside so much. We just upped our molecules. I got the air pro. We got
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.640]   another one in the house and then, you know, we survived. We survived. Molecule is reinventing
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:40.720]   the notion, the future of clean air starting with the air purifier. It is not an air filter,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.920]   per se. It does have filtration, kind of a first stage, but really what molecule does is much more
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   sophisticated. It's called picofotoelectrochemical oxidation. So in the molecule, which is a beautiful,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.240]   by the way, machined aluminum cylinder. After the air goes through the filter at the bottom,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.760]   the traditional filter at the bottom, it comes up through a catalyst, a catalytic converter,
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   in effect, that traps pollutants and really tiny ones too. Viruses, bacteria, mold, even volatile
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:21.360]   organic compounds, things that, you know, come off your carpets and your drapes,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.520]   traps them. And instead of just trapping them, it destroys them, which I love. We have the light
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   off while we're sleeping and it comes when it comes on in the morning. I could just almost hear
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   the little screams as the little bugs all die as the purifier just destroys them. Molecule air
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.880]   purifiers in the home and in the office and even in medical spaces, destroying pollutants,
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:51.040]   providing clean air, they're quiet, they're effective. Molecules, picotechnology meets the
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   performance requirements in FDA's guidance for use in helping reduce the risk of exposure to
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.960]   SARS-COVID to the COVID-19 virus in healthcare settings. A lot of, you'll see a molecules in
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.600]   a lot of dental offices and medical offices. Of course, you still have to, I'm not saying you
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.920]   don't have to wash your hands and wear a mask and all that stuff, but this extra layer of virus
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   protection is frankly quite reassuring. The Molecule Air Pro-Rx, which is the one you most
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.960]   often see in medical offices, is FDA approved 510(k) class II medical device for medical purposes to
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:30.080]   destroy bacteria and viruses in the air. FDA approved. But there are many molecules for whatever your
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.320]   needs. For a bedroom, say the Molecule Air Mini, for rooms up to 250 square feet. The Molecule Air,
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.160]   that's what we had for a long time. We have that in our bedroom now. My class in his bedroom,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.840]   we have had one in the studio for a long time. That's for rooms up to 600 square feet. Once they
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.280]   added the Molecule Air Pro, we got that for the studio. That's up to 1000 square feet. There's also
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.680]   new. The Air Mini Plus has a particle sensor and auto protect mode, so it adjusts the fan speed
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.960]   based on the sensor. But you know it's quiet because it's here in our studio and it's working. Actually,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   we have two of them working. Are they both plugged in? John, did you? Yeah, they're both plugged in.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.600]   Belt and suspenders, baby. You don't hear it, but it's working and I love that.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:20.880]   If you're at all curious about the technology, go to the website Molecule.com and read the white
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.080]   papers. It's worth reading. It's worth reading. You can actually see the test results right there.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.400]   I am a Molecule fan. We use it here. We use it at home and I highly recommend it for your home

[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.320]   is probably much worse than the air outside, except when there's fires. Third anniversary of
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.920]   those fires. There were fires two years ago too, but that was the one that destroyed Paradise.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.960]   Three years ago, the coffee park burned. Lots of Santa Rosa. You go back up there. People have
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.440]   rebuilt. The houses are back right there. There's one area of coffee park where there's a tree,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:37.360]   a blackened tree that they decided to leave, I guess, is a memento of what a horrific week that
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:47.040]   was around here. On we go, speaking of horrific weeks, Apple's suffering apparently horrific
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.200]   week. I fix it reports. I'm very curious what you all think about this. I don't know if this is
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:01.360]   anything new, but they say Apple's new screen repair trap could change the repair industry forever.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.760]   I think this has happened before, but if you have an iPhone 13 and you replace the screen,
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:15.520]   it'll completely disable Face ID. It will no longer work. I fix it tested with a variety of
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.800]   phones on iOS 15 and 15.1. They say our results have been replicated by numerous
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.960]   professionals. As I remember when this has happened in the past, Apple has said security, but
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.280]   I fix it says it's hard to understand this is a security measure given that the Face ID
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:40.000]   illuminator is entirely separate from the screen. They say it's the spot before and they fixed it.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.120]   Now it's intentional. You think it's a bug?
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.800]   No, I think they just pulled. They just said they gave a statement to the
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.880]   Verge of somebody saying they're rolling it back to their next update.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.160]   So it was a bug?
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.000]   Okay, what happened before? Either a bug or they keep attempting it and they keep getting
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.440]   in trouble for it and they keep pulling back. One of those two things is true.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:03.680]   It's probably big D in our Twitter forums that that would be illegal in Europe.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:11.280]   Yeah, I think once people find out about it, they're going to have to roll it back at least in
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.880]   Europe. Their goal every time is to stop somebody from getting like not somebody,
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:19.920]   but a nation state or like a well-funded actor to get a hold of your device and swap the sensor
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:27.040]   to defeat the biometrics. But there's different ways of doing that. Once before with Touch ID
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.360]   and now with this, it just broke if you try to do it. But there are much more sophisticated ways
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.120]   that they can do it. It looks they fixed it back then. They just reversed it. So you had to have
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.960]   genuine Apple parts didn't matter if they were the same parts or not. It would just work.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.280]   It looks like they're doing the exact same fix here. So it's less sensitive to what kind of
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.000]   parts you're swapping it for. The EU has embraced right to repair. They actually require Apple to
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.320]   provide parts and tools to independent repairs for a minimum of five years of any given product.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.360]   So I guess you could say here's the part, but it was the face ID won't work.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:06.640]   It's not a good experience. No. Yeah, and that's absolutely not a good look for Apple either.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.760]   So this is the sort of thing that they really need to fix very, very quickly.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.200]   I know that on other platforms, it's not so much that they're checking for codes on specific
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.720]   components, but that at boot up, they do like a check sum that says, what is the math? What is
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.000]   the answer to this math problem involving all the codes we're getting from all the components?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.040]   And if they don't match from launch to launch, then that's when it says, okay, I've been tampered
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.920]   with. So I'm going to disable certain features that people are going to trust. So I could definitely
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.960]   believe that this was just a bug, but it's hard to believe that after getting caught in this sort
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.440]   of problem the first time, one of the things that they put through testing is not what happens
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   if we take random display and swap it in. Will it still boot? It seems as though that should be part
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:56.160]   of the pre launch, the pre launch of device testing. Apple authorized repair shops have access to a
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.280]   software tool that can make a phone except a new screen. So you know, you can, it basically,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.040]   it reminds me of the John Deere situation where you can make a repair on a John Deere tractor,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.880]   but it won't work until the John Deere authorized software certifies it. They are also very much
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.200]   against right to repair. For the printer, yeah, for the Nespress. I've heard not about this
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.080]   problem, but I've heard from other other very similar problems that at a certain point, like a no,
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.120]   a go no go decision is made. Like, we know this is a problem, this is our shipping deadline. Is
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.360]   this sufficient that we should change a shipping deadline, or can we fix this afterwards? And
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.520]   somebody makes a decision and often there are people who vehemently disagree with that decision,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.040]   say, no, this has to be fixed first, and they don't always win those arguments, but they have
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   those arguments every time. Yeah, as you said, Apple is told Apple has told the verge it will
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.320]   release a software update that does not require you to jump through hoops. In other words,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.880]   transfer the micro controller using micro soldering techniques.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.480]   And instantly, that's the whenever he raises a good point. It's also given that every time there's
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.040]   a new phone that comes out, there's always people who do the side by side by side, by side comparisons
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:07.280]   of pictures. But the fine tuning, the fine tuning, the picture pipeline of what a picture
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.520]   looks like by the time gets deposited into your picture roll. That is a classic example, the sort
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.440]   of thing, bro, but we know that we know this isn't working exactly the way that we want it to,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.280]   that we can make this work better. But there is no way that we're holding up the shipping of the
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.680]   phone because we don't think that the color is quite right on skies. We can easily fix that
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.640]   with a patch software in your future. So that's why you don't really, that's why if someone is
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:35.680]   trying to get you to click on an article saying, Oh, the new iPhone 13 is nowhere near as good as
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.280]   the iPhone 12 or this $300 Motorola phone. Here we have the evidence wait until like a month passes
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.000]   before you really accept any conclusions about how well a certain camera phone works.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.760]   I'm starting to get very clear of the machine learning that's going into like the photos
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:59.520]   in the sense that my live view is oftentimes half the clarity of what ends up on my role.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.800]   Like it's it's an amazing thing. Like you're taking a picture of something that looks kind of soft and
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.000]   doesn't look like it's going to work. You hit the button and then it pops up and you're like,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.040]   wow, it's a lot sharper than what I just saw. And especially things like the depth of field,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.200]   you know, inside of the portrait mode is looks horrible. I mean, it looks like the
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.440]   way it always has been. I guess. So I would say, I'll give you it always has been this live.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.800]   Yeah, but then you take the pictures and then it's and then suddenly it fixes it. It fixes it
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.840]   by the time it hits the role and you're like, wow, that was a lot better than I expected.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.440]   One of the things I before I left, I wanted to take down to Mexico is the Pixel Pro 6
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:42.480]   6 Pro and Jason kindly let me his I did get mine eventually. But here's an example. This is a raw
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.240]   image from a graveyard, you know, because it was the day of the dead. So we spent some time in
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.840]   graveyards on the picks. This is the Pixel Pro 6. I'd be very pixel six probably very curious to
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:59.120]   see what Annie and Renee get. But this is the after processing image and it really, it really is
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.320]   pretty amazing. The night vision as long as nobody's moving. It's in a graveyard. That's a pretty safe
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.240]   bet. So hopefully you got bigger problems. I mean, you are.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.480]   It's funny because like Apple used to be religious about what you see is what you get. We're not
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.920]   going to do anything if we can't do it real time. But that prevented them from doing things like
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.240]   night mode, which became a huge competitive disadvantage. So now they're sucking it up. But it means that
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.360]   you do see like with with like the fusion methods and the night mode methods and the image stacking,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.400]   you do see that little delay. And the funniest thing to me is that Apple and Google, like Apple
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.200]   is usually incredibly opinionated and controlling. And Google's usually very granola crunchy,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.760]   hippie, but their photo teams are the reverse. Apple's photo team is like, we're going to give you
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.600]   this capabilities, but you get to pick how it all works out. And Google's team is like,
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.200]   we're going to reduce everything to base bits. And then we're going to give you a Google pixel
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   image that's going to look like the best damn Google pixel image you're ever going to get
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.400]   for every photo. And it's like, but that's that's the reverse of your usual approaches.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.840]   I'm going to try to get Lisa to say she took the 13. So I want to see how the pictures of the
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.120]   graveyard came out on the 13. But my problem with the picture, I'll be very curious. They're all
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.440]   good now. I'd be very curious though, where you guys when you spend some time, Andy, if you had
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.360]   some time yet with the Pixel six, bro, yeah, I've been taking a lot of pictures with it over the
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.560]   past week. And I've been very, very pleased with it so far. Particularly when you match it up with
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:26.320]   Adobe Lightroom for mobile, that it's it'll take great pictures in and of itself. I haven't caught
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.520]   it doing anything that I don't like it does with the there's a lot of processing. If you
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.240]   see it, you can see it. I was about to I was about to say it's with this with this very first version
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.160]   of the of the firmware. It over cooks things a little bit, not so much that it's bad, but as much that
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.440]   if you are looking for a more softer, more natural look, you might want to have to twiddle a few
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:55.120]   things in the twiddle, a few sliders to fix it. However, in terms of getting it taking that one
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.000]   button press and getting a really good picture, or if you're me taking that one better one button
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.640]   press, getting a really good picture, and then wanting to mess around with it in Lightroom to
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.200]   make it exactly look the exactly the way you want to. There was so much latitude there. I took a
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.840]   I took a picture of the crescent moon last night just out through my windows like okay, that's really
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.800]   really cool. And I was able to use like the adjustable the black point and white point controls while
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.560]   I was doing the capture to get the exposure the way I wanted to. And wasn't until I was like
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   zooming way in later on that realized that son of a bee if you if you zoom way way way way in on the
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.080]   crescent, it was actually getting so much light data with that correct light setting that I could
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.520]   actually see like the shady side of the moon, upside the crescent. So it wasn't as though all
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.600]   those white pixels blew out everything around it. There was a little bit of halo around it that
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.360]   you would expect, but you see the complete circle of the of the complete moon underneath there.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.000]   And that's when that was reminded that the that the capabilities of even even a thousand
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.320]   dollar phone have got even even accepting this $1000 phone have really, really gone up in the past
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.680]   three or four or five years. I still think the iPhone I even the iPhone 12 is superior for video.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:15.840]   I think the video is getting an iPhone 12 was stunning. And I'm sure that's better.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.200]   Google's Google's always playing catch up with video. They just got into HDR for video there.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.960]   But the good news is that it is high frame rate 4K and I left it running for like 15, 20 minutes
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.120]   and was still it has wasn't overheating. It wasn't shutting down or anything like that. So
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.440]   I'm not sure if it's good enough for people who actually want to shoot video from YouTube for
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.920]   so like that. But yeah, I mean, for for people like me who don't for whom video is not a profession,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.680]   it's perfectly fine. But yeah, there's definitely people who know what they're talking about have
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   been saying that, yeah, you still want to get if you're doing video, you definitely want an iPhone.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.400]   Actually, that was one big takeaway for me was I'm very still very happy with the 12.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.080]   And I don't get both photos and video and I don't really notice, you know, at least had the 13.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.520]   I'm happy with the 12. I don't think I don't feel any any sense of the macro.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.160]   It's just battery. Battery life too. Well, I'm battery life. Yeah.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:20.320]   Yeah. Yeah. I'm upgrading from a Pixel 4a that cost $350 last year. So this is my first flagship
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.760]   phone in like three or four years. So this is this is the schedule that I think you should be on.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:32.160]   I was pleased I haven't been to the public garden yet to do the official squirrel photos,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.360]   but I was actually I was at a nature preserve a few days ago just taking a walk and managed to
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.720]   catch one in the wild. They're very, very they're not as patient. They don't simply say, oh, if you
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.400]   have sunflower seeds, I will pose for you for 10 or 15 minutes or 20 minutes. I'll pose for you
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.000]   right on your shoulder. If you've got the bag held up high in in the wild, the fact that I was able
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.040]   to have that that forex zoom going really, really fast and just whip it up and get the get a
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:02.480]   an actually decent picture that pleased me a lot. It's very good on the Pixel 6. I have to say the
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.560]   zoom is really good. He's making these make it because that's because it's yeah, it's it's not
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.120]   because it's not just the optical. It's also else. It does something really, really clever where
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:17.440]   as you're zooming, it basically steals information about what's in between pixels as you're doing
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.480]   the zoom. Like as you're moving as you're moving the camera around unconsciously just by virtue of
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.880]   the fact that you're a human being who you know has caffeine every now and then, it can actually
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.440]   use that that data interpolate interpolate a little bit. That's that's why it's so hard to do
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.920]   feel like these days you're doing like a real apples to apples comparison between two phones.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:42.320]   Like you said, I think that at a certain all phones at the same sort of flagship level
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.520]   perform almost exactly the same. Some will outperform the others if you do a certain side by side,
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.960]   but you can't really predict which is going to be and it really comes down to do you want to
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.480]   really comes down to everything else that's involved in this phone. I'm comfortable in saying
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:06.800]   that the pixel for excuse me, the pixel six is as good as a top tier iPhone, but that doesn't mean
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.080]   that every phone every photo it takes is going to be as to your liking as the same picture taken
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.920]   with an iPhone 13 or vice versa. I don't want to make Anthony feel bad.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:27.440]   But Twitter is giving all active iOS engineers in iOS and Android engineers maxed out
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.000]   Mac book pro maxes. So is uber.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.880]   So I'm sorry, Anthony, you don't work for uber or twitter. That's all I can say. I mean,
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.520]   the little time savings. I was gonna give you one like a year.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:49.760]   Flame FedEx. Yeah, it's like an insane stat. Upgrades, upgrades in general are easy math when
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.440]   someone is using a lot of computing power. So when there's a lot of computing power on someone
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.760]   and you know, that's that math is generally a really simple one to get someone the highest.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.000]   The fastest computer that you can get them. Yeah, if you bill out how much it costs for that
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.800]   engineer to sit, watch in the software compile, it doesn't take much more than a week or two before
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.960]   the the faster machine pays for itself. So it's worth it. Yeah, too many benchmarks are based on
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:23.040]   GPU output based on gaming frame rate based on how quickly can compile a video project.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:29.520]   But really the the the the one the real compute for dough set set ups is always going to be building
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.840]   code. And that's the easy easy easy choice that do you want to build this in 20 minutes? Do you
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.960]   want to build this in two minutes? Easy. I bookmarked this on Halloween. I don't know if you talked about
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:44.800]   it last week. Jean-Louis Gasey, I always read his Monday note, former Apple president. He was
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.680]   Europe, head of Europe, Apple Europe for a while, then did BOS. And I still think he's a pretty
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:57.600]   astute Apple observer. Did some interesting kind of thought experiments on what will Apple look like
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:04.720]   in 10 years? He starts with kind of some misdirection saying who will be Tim Cook's successor.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.480]   He actually likes Jeff Williams, even though Jeff's only a few years two years younger
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:17.600]   than Cook. But like two feet taller. He's taller. And that's and that's really matters. But no,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.400]   the reason he likes Jeff Williams is interesting because he he wants he says, can the next 10 years
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:34.240]   for Apple bring the same growth? We know trees don't grow to the sky. But what market would Apple
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:39.760]   grow in? He says, well, dismiss cars right away, even though Apple continues to hire Tesla engineers
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:46.320]   and you spend lots of money on cars. He says, to be sure a few million Apple cars at 50k would
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.360]   make the auto industry a mother load for Apple as it has for Tesla. But I don't think it'll
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.720]   cause this automation. Yeah, it's a whole bunch of automation products.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.600]   Apple's a high margin company. The car business heels low margins. He says,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.560]   auto the problem with that argument is the phone business is a low margin. Well, that's true.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.720]   You can transform it. Like you know, like you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.320]   informed it. That's right. Yep. You don't have to just just got to play a different game.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:15.920]   Autopilot technology said is kind of stuck at level two without much hope of getting level five in
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   the foreseeable future. That's been a little bit of a disappointment to a lot of people,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.680]   including Tesla. I think one of the problems with that is that people are, I mean,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   highways are very doable. It's the side roads that are problematic. And most of us, what we
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.560]   would love to do is be able to get on the highway and then not have to think about this for a while.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.000]   You could almost do that already. I mean, honestly, most can do it already. Most of the
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.280]   aid asks the assist you're not supposed to. Well, you keep your hands on the wheel. I keep my hands
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.880]   on the wheel, but it's doing adaptive cruise control. It's checking lanes. It's keeping in the lane.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.280]   It's doing mostly what you want to do in a highway situation, for sure. And my Tesla did the same.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.840]   He says augmented reality. Hold on. It's often cited as having the potential to change the tech
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:06.960]   industry. It's more realistic than cars. And while Facebook is pushing the meta verse,
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   he says, "AR has no, don't yell at him. No broad use case that Apple could seize us wrong."
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.880]   It's a launch a new wave of growth. Yeah, it might be wrong. I do agree. I may not agree completely
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.280]   with those points, but I do agree with what he finally comes down to, which is healthcare.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:30.480]   He says, "Apple, if you're looking for an industry where there is lots of room to grow and a lot of
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:37.920]   money to make, even in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, we're talking perhaps a trillion
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.320]   dollar business." Tim Cook said that out loud, right? He said, "Apple's going to be best known for
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:49.920]   their health initiatives." Yeah, it fits in kind of with what Apple has, Apple's kind of heart.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.080]   And also, and, as I say, comes full circle by saying, "By the way, the senior Apple executive
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.960]   who drives the company's health initiatives is Jeff Williams." So that wouldn't make sense.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.760]   Lisa has some... Do you have any graveyard pictures from your iPhone 13? You sent them to me?
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.440]   Slap them to me? Okay. Because I just... Yeah, see, those are pretty good. Those are pretty good.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:19.200]   This is an altar. These are edited. No, not edited. Oh, all right. She has another chance to edit them
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.080]   yet. Hold on. Let me show you one more. This is a very similar one to the one I showed you.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.560]   The color's different. In some ways, I kind of like the iPhone 13 color.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.040]   I've made a conscious decision to not make the nighttime look like daylight. They wanted to
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.640]   keep the ambiance of nighttime and just let you see more in it to not try to make it look like
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   the sun had come up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And on the Google one, it was almost like, wow,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.440]   it's so bright. They want to make it look like daytime. Yeah. Yeah. In front approach.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.360]   More aesthetic judgment than a technical one, I think. Yeah. It's all aesthetics now. It's all
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.040]   the opinion of the camera team. That's all we're getting. The technology is all good. It's just
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.280]   the opinion of the camera team. These are quite... Here's another one. This is, I think, a really good
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.880]   example of... Remember, this is almost completely dark except for the candlelight. There was one
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.240]   light, I think, that's casting some light on this one. But pretty nice. I think the iPhone and the
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.920]   Pixel 6 did very well in the graveyard, just in case you needed any graveyard shoots in your future.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:22.320]   The other complication always is that you can... A connoisseur would say, oh man, all you did was
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:29.200]   like add hot sauce and salt and butter to this. But then the other... But I like hot sauce and
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:36.640]   butter and salt. And this is my photo, not yours. I'm posting this. It does become a personal
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:41.760]   choice, doesn't it? Yeah. Here's... I guess actually we could do almost a head-to-head.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:47.520]   Here's the Pixel 6. And here is the iPhone. And I think that really does sum it up a little bit.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:52.960]   The Pixel 6 looks more processed to me. This looked actually more like what it really looked like.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:57.520]   There is some light here on this one from these streetlights in the back.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   Anyway, I didn't mean to jump back there, but at least... Everyone gets a great photo. This is
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:08.160]   what everyone gets a great photo. That's really the bottom line. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right,
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:14.960]   so health, John O'Ega say, maybe Apple could do cars and could do AR and could do health. Who
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.480]   knows? Do they have to pick one? I don't know. I think that's the big revision.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:28.240]   I think that with all three of them, what we're seeing Apple do is very, very low, slow and massive
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:36.400]   rollouts. So health is being slowly added into our watches and the process is this giant move.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.560]   With cars, whatever Apple's going to do with cars, they have a team working on it.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:46.160]   So they're doing something and it's just like this big slow move. And the same thing with AR,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.040]   they've been building up for the last five years. So there's talking about it when they need to.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.880]   I think most of the time when Tim Cooks talking about it a lot, it's because they're trying to make
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.360]   deals with the people that quietly make deals with folks and say, "Yeah, this is important to us.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:05.200]   See what Tim just said?" But I think that makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, that's why I'm talking
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.520]   about AR a lot the last few years. And I'm worried about your companies.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.360]   They're trying to, well, not acquire AR companies, but try to get companies to adopt.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:19.520]   It takes a long time to build the pipeline. This is what Facebook isn't doing very well.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:26.800]   It's what Google really painfully failed because they were way ahead. I worked with those phones.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:33.440]   We were shipping those phones in from China because they wouldn't put them on their own phones
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.040]   with LiDAR and everything else. And so Google was way ahead. They just didn't build the acquisition
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:46.320]   tools. And so what Apple's doing with reality converter and creator and with object capture and
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:54.000]   slowly rolling USDZ out, you're building an entire ecosystem before you roll AR out.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.760]   That's why they're adding AR to every little bit of things to keep on seeding the ideas.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:05.920]   It's probably still a little ways out, but it's going to be bigger than the phone if they do it right.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.080]   It's still speculative. I do think that AR is in the same category as
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:20.160]   level 5, maybe even level 4 autonomous driving. It'll almost certainly happen.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.840]   It'll certainly happen within our lifetimes. Beyond that, I'm not only to speculate
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.080]   because there are just so many roadblocks that have to be solved and not all of them can be solved
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.840]   with engineering and technology. A lot of it is going to be cultural and a lot of it is going to
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.320]   have to be wait and see what people want and try to steer them to a place where they can want
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.760]   something better. A lot of these things are just out of your reach anyway.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:47.200]   Non-invasive glucose monitoring has been promised and not delivered for years. And if you could get
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.400]   that, there's a massive market of Apple keeps buying companies that keep saying they're a year
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.360]   away. And it's like, we're a year away. We keep buying you. We always hear away. We've named three
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:04.320]   things that we're this close to reaching. Exactly. It's there are a lot of technologies that are
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.640]   a engineering example of Xenos Paradox where you can get halfway towards the finish line a
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.320]   million times. But as always, the remaining distance, even if when it becomes half a millimeter,
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.120]   that is the most difficult half a millimeter you will ever have to travel. And Renee also pointed
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.440]   out something that is also going to be a challenge not only for Apple, but for everybody else.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.400]   Tech companies in a lot of different esoteric markets, they are actually very,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.240]   very thrilled to be bought out by Google. They're very, very thrilled to become part of Apple
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.800]   to get the sort of resources where they don't have to productize this technology.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.440]   They have to simply integrate it and they have people who can pump so much money into their
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:50.880]   research so they can actually get it going. But the question is, will the US allow large companies
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:57.120]   to buy these small companies as easily in the future as they have in the past? Because I do
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:03.920]   agree with the supposition that health far beyond what Apple is doing right now is such a huge
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:09.120]   opportunity for them. And it's such a great, they're in such a great position to really take
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.080]   advantage of it. They may get, they may get health with free with the watch, you know,
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.960]   it's just a matter of, well, I think about, I'm thinking about, imagine Theranos, but it works.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.320]   Yeah. Like imagine, I'm not talking about like,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:26.160]   not a blood drop, but I'm talking about what if they've, what if they made it a priority
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:31.120]   or saying there must be a way that we can put diagnostic tools in the hands of make make
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.080]   it the start. It's a start track. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The tricorder. Yeah. I mean,
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:41.280]   the watch could end up being a tricorder when we don't know the cars could be,
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.760]   strive themselves when I was, but we don't know. I was, I was talking to someone who's working on
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.360]   technology that that that I don't think a secret there. They're, I mean, they say, say to be secret,
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.720]   then you can take your iPhone and actually point it at your eye and it will calculate your prescription.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   Right. Like, you know, like literally it'll look in and look out and it'll go, that's your,
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.920]   this is your prescription. I saw that. I saw a demo of that, the Media Lab like 10 years ago,
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.920]   even more than that. Right. And they were trying to deploy two places where they just don't have
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.800]   eye doctors who can do a test like that. But because smartphones are ubiquitous, they can say,
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   well, here is an app that we will prescribe to you. We will give you access to through our health
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.280]   network and just tell us, and just push this button, you will have your glasses in like two
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.200]   weeks time and you won't be able to, you won't have to be that much point. If it would be, if you
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.760]   are a one and a half trillion dollar company with a couple of hundred billion dollars to spend
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:36.960]   prudent to work on all three areas, any breakthrough in any one of those could, could be another
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.440]   thing, billion dollar business or 10 billion dollar business. The interesting thing for Apple,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.400]   though, I think is that they, they are doing both. They're trying to have their cake and eat it too,
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.800]   and that they keep deploying these interim versions. Like we've been seeing interim AR on the iPhone
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.640]   for a while. We've been seeing interim health on the Apple Watch for a while. And if you take just
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.520]   VR, for example, it's going to take a while to get the mainstream VR, but every rumor suggests
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:02.080]   that next year or the year after we're going to get a $3,000 Apple headset with 8K per eye
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:08.480]   displays with a custom Apple M3 generation processor to drive it all as fast as a super
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.240]   computer, well, not a beefy tower computer drives VR today. And it'll have all the Apple TV programming
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.920]   that they spent the last year, a couple of years people asking, why are they doing that?
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.280]   They'll have fitness plus an Apple entertainment and Apple gaming and all of this
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.600]   built into it. And it'll be expensive and it'll be bound to other Apple hardware. The way the
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:31.440]   Apple first Apple Watch was 700 bucks and bound to iTunes, but then two, three, four years after
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.080]   that, we'll get closer and closer to the glasses. So I think they're smart in that they try to pay
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:41.200]   technology off with interim steps all along the pipeline. And if you look at, if you look at
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.080]   something like with the AR, it's an ecosystem that they're building. And so a lot of, you know,
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   we're seeing, oh, why would they put 360 and the ability to manipulate 3D models inside of motion
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.960]   and final cut? I don't know, maybe because those are the authoring packages for what you need to
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.120]   do, you know, that you have control over. You don't have to ask someone to do those things,
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.520]   you know, and so those are those are the kind of things that they can do. And as that ecosystem
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:13.280]   gets richer. And I think from make the case, I can see how you can make a ton of money
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:19.040]   from just noninvasive glucose monitoring. But health, if you got even more, you can see you can
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.520]   make a ton of money. I can see how you can make it maybe a little bit less, but a ton of money
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:29.760]   from making really good self-driving cars. Make a case for why AR could be that lucrative, Alex.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:36.560]   Mark, I just did it, Leo. You saw the meta video. Yeah, right. So, so, yeah, so I'm not going to
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.080]   call it. I don't know who I can say and who I can, but a friend of mine, you know, was building
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:46.160]   some USDZ models and showed them to his sales, sales staff, and they put it on their iPad and
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.600]   showed it to the first client. And the first client got so excited, they were like, okay, we have to
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:54.080]   build the all everything else that the company makes in three in USDZ because we have to be able
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.640]   to see all these and be able to show it to them. You know, and so the thing is, is that, you know,
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:03.680]   right now we're in this kind of early stage where everything is hard because it's hard to develop
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:10.640]   those things. But when you see USDZ working, you know, you go, oh, you know, I can now put this on my,
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.960]   you know, I can put something on my desk and see if that's going to fit, if it's going to look good,
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.360]   I can put furniture in my, you know, those kinds of things. And right now it's very nascent technology.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.320]   I mean, right now it's barely working. There's little examples of it, you know, and I think Apple's
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.440]   keeping a lot of powder dry because they're not interested in getting everybody else excited about
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.960]   it. There's a bunch of us out there just going, you know, until until they turn the switch on.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:36.240]   Now, the thing is, is that I've gotten so used to it because I'm now building USDZ models for
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.680]   everything and everything that I want to do. And what I do is I had a, I was doing presentation for
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:48.560]   a client last week. And what I did is I put all the objects that I want to talk about in USDZ.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.880]   I'm in motion rendering out those those files, but just changing the camera angle. Oh, I really
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.440]   want to show what their product from over here. And so I just rotate it around and hit render and
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.800]   put it into keynote. Now, eventually I'm not going to have to hit render and put it into keynote.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.360]   I'm just going to put a, have a 3D object in 3D keynote, rotate it around and drop it. Or while
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.760]   I'm in the presentation, rotate it around while I'm showing it to them. Or eventually tap on it
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.000]   and it shows up on their, you know, on their phone and they can look at it, you know, in front of
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.200]   themselves. And so, but, but like for instance, just generating the geometry is a huge lift.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.560]   If it was just available inside of pages and keynote, it would create a gold rush, you know,
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.480]   for building 3D models, because suddenly you're able to now rotate those objects.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.440]   If someone has to do, I have to do tons and tons of explainer things to clients about how things
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.920]   are going to work. And the idea that I don't have to have a 3D artist, I have, I can just
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.360]   drop it into keynote, rotate it and drop it, you know, down or in motion. I just did the whole
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.640]   animation set of animations in motion with 3D objects, you know, and eventually all of that's
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.720]   going to be something that you can pick up with your phone, you know, and I think that, I mean,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.280]   eventually maybe there's wearables, but even before that, there's a huge ecosystem to build all that
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.840]   geometry and all of those things that it's available right now. I think that it will take a, you know,
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.640]   the hard part is that what Google never got was critical mass. So they didn't have critical
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.400]   mass of developers, they didn't have critical mass of consumers, they didn't have, now Apple is
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.200]   slowly rolling LiDAR out to everything, you know, and so, you know, it's in the higher end right now.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.720]   There's going to be some point where LiDAR is just part of every phone that shipped and now you have
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.640]   hundreds of millions of consumers ready to use something that you can roll into, you know, and so
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:34.000]   the glasses are not that important compared to the fact that you can, you know, really get the data,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.120]   you know, locked down and really be able to see some amazing experiences. And so it's,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.440]   it's just getting started. And again, I think Apple is trying to promote it enough to get
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.520]   developers, but not, not promoted enough to get consumers yet. So I think that they're keeping
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.560]   that powder really dry. If I could expand that a little bit, like it's not hard to imagine it
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.720]   extrapolate a few years out where whatever device you have, all it does is handle local
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.360]   authentication and cloud connection to whatever storage you happen to have. And then everything
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.000]   else is handled sort of that dream of multiple endpoints, you know, everything else is handled
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.800]   by an AR interface, whatever Apple's calling star at the moment. But when you build all these,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.000]   these things that Alex is talking about, the ability to understand the environment,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.840]   that's usable for automation, not just cars, but robots and all sorts of things that are going to
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.760]   get productized over the next 10 years. But also you need that for any of these interfaces that
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.440]   are coming, it has to understand your environment, then it starts layering those interfaces in front
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.600]   of you. And it doesn't matter if you have a phone or a tablet, it all becomes like opportunistic.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.760]   You sit down at a desk and it gives you your environment. That's, you know, you see that through
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   your, your glasses one day and you don't have to worry about, do I have the latest phone, do I
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.560]   have the latest tablet, you just have that whole ecosystem nicely filled by all the
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.800]   USD Z files flying around, but you don't even notice anymore. That's just part of the relay
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.680]   system and the subscriptions that you're paying for absolutely everything. But it becomes sort of
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.400]   device agnostic at that point. I think that's the future Apple's shooting towards. It's just going
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.560]   to take multiple steps and multiple years to get there. And it will, and it'll take an enormous
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.080]   amount of investment from Apple. This is where hopefully they learn from iBooks,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   is that you have to put real money into content development. You know, they're not going to be
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.200]   able to just put this out there. This is what Google's like, okay, we'll put it out there and
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.360]   see what you guys do with it. Nobody did anything. I did something. I was by myself. So anyway,
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   so the, but I think that I think Apple, if they put the money into it to develop it, it would,
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.640]   it'll, it'll go a long way. I think, if I were going to put my money, I'd put it on medical in
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.000]   terms of just raw potential. But there's a lot of headwinds, if you're going to do medical,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.760]   but you have to get insurance companies, Medicare and FDA, and it's just complicated.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.800]   In fact, Apple's already seen that with the Apple Watch. Cars also very complicated because
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.920]   I think the future of private ownership of vehicles, even as in doubt. So this is a,
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.440]   changing in the Apple fleet. It's a, yeah, it's a complicated and changing industry.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:08.560]   Plus Apple doesn't have much, you know, existing infrastructure in that industry or any, to be honest.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.320]   So I think even though I'm less excited about AR and what you can do with it,
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.400]   Apple's already there. They've already been building this. So they already have the people.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.680]   And there's nobody, there's nobody to say, no, you can't do that. There's no government agency
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.080]   yet. But I think that it's going to be a lot easier for Apple to penetrate that market. So
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.360]   I think there's more money probably in healthcare than any of the above, but that doesn't mean it's
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.360]   going to be easy to pluck that. That's absolutely right. There's also another category we haven't
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.120]   talked about, which is finance that if you want to be easy for Apple, if they can just get into it.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.280]   If they really were to light a fire underneath what they're doing with Apple Pay and the Apple
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.000]   card, and they decided that we have a lot of problems. There are a lot of problems with
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.840]   investing, with cash, with moving money from one country to another. Like if part of your family
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.760]   is across a border, there are a lot of problems that we're in a very good position to solve.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.840]   And parenthetically, to shareholders, they say, it's really, really good if people give us their
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.040]   money and we just hold on to it for a while until they post what they want to do.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.840]   So that's another opportunity for them.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.160]   People made money on PayPal's, right? I think there's a few people who came out of PayPal.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.640]   And one of the loans is owned Starfleet.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.800]   And that's a possibility too.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.400]   I mean, Apple is like two inches away from being a bank.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   They're like, I think it's just like, it's seen as a paradox all over again. It says last two inches.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.360]   It is. It is. But if they pulled it out, I mean, between Apple Cash and the Apple credit card,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.800]   and then all the things you buy, you get to a point where you're just buying stuff from Apple
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.160]   with the card that Apple gave you that you know, like there's, you know, the thing can,
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.000]   it's pretty efficient if they actually sell.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   Is Microsoft still worth more than Apple now?
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.240]   I briefly last week.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.800]   I think there's still number one.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.360]   I think that in terms of valuation, Apple is still underneath Microsoft by one click.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.560]   Maybe not to thought that.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.240]   The big tweets from their sorry, the tweet polls from their CEO as much as they are.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.040]   Who would have thought that?
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.360]   I mean, that 20 years ago, Microsoft was, I remember Dvorak always saying, well, who's
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.000]   well would you want? Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. But that's completely flimsy.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.120]   Friends out, there's also a muscle.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.760]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.720]   Well, that's the thing that we keep forgetting. It's like, and inside of Microsoft, they're saying,
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.280]   you know what? You can have all of the, all of the columnists, all the commentators saying how
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   innovative Apple is. You can say about how, how Elon Musk is redefining an entire category
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.960]   transportation will be the gears that power every single business that needs to build cars,
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.600]   that needs to build everything else. It's a good place to be if you're interested in making money.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.800]   It's not sexy. It's not proud. We still can't make a folding phone with a dam, but hey,
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.840]   we got enough cash so we can float the surface.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:02.720]   Microsoft's market cap is 2.53 trillion compared to Apple's 2.468 trillion as of this recording.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.960]   So Microsoft is, Leo, we live in a world where Tim Cook is worth like 1.2 billion and Kendall Jenner
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.000]   is worth 45 billion.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.400]   I know.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.800]   None of this meat needs anything anymore.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.160]   Even Paris Hilton's worth more than Tim Cook, and that's really a shame.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.080]   It's getting into NFTs.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.920]   My God, I need to get into NFTs.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   Who's going to become richer? What's going, which technology is going to happen sooner?
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.400]   Try, a tricorder in your watch are asteroid harvesting.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.120]   Well, asteroid harvesting has logistical issues.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.880]   Well, yeah. So does this.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:44.000]   Mm. Oh, we crushed Cleveland. We thought we were going to park the asteroid in Colorado.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.880]   We accident.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   You don't bring it back. You just bring the raw materials back.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.600]   You leave the asteroids. Bring the browns back to Cleveland, not asteroids.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.040]   There you go. There you go.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.840]   It's too late. It's too late.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.160]   Someone else moved in. There's already someone in the house.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.760]   Did you watch the, you know, back into the house?
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.880]   I know. Sportball is probably even worse than talking about Google on this show,
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.120]   but did you watch the Steelers game last night? That was pretty exciting.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.360]   It was crazy. It was crazy.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.280]   It's exciting when you're not a Steelers fan. For a Steelers fan, we call it Sunday.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.840]   It's like every Steelers game is like this. We're losing in the last two minutes.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.560]   I just wish the Steelers would just blow somebody out just once.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.040]   Oh, just once. Like, even when I was a friend that was working on one of the games.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.760]   You guys were doing pretty well. You know, like I was, it was like 21 to something or other.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.800]   And this was another game a couple weeks ago. And I said, yeah, it's the Steelers. You watch.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.320]   You know, end of the game. It's like right down the razor.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.400]   It was a crazy game. It was a crazy game.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   I just somebody without a dog and either hunt. I enjoyed it. It was fun to watch.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.440]   I was thinking about you though, the whole time.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.120]   I just wish that I just wish the graphics team on Monday Night Football
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.920]   would look at the graphics on Sunday Night Football.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   Yeah. And mine the gap between the two because Sunday Night Football,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.440]   the graphics are so I just watched the I watched Sunday Night Football for the graphics.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.480]   You know, like it's it's really really well done. And Monday Night Football, not so much.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.560]   It's like kind of college plus.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.760]   Let's take a little break. We'll come back with more. You got to go back to the
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.680]   illustrating what's wrong with this. Yes.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.000]   I'm sitting in the Alex. I do. I do. Yeah, you could do it in office hours.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.960]   Bank it part of your roll it into your office hours. Alex Lindsey office hours.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:33.200]   Global. If you want to know more about that from WGBH Boston and places East and
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.760]   Ico and Ico.com also known as the Boba Fett of the Opera.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:47.200]   Boba Met. Boba Met. I like it. I like it. Renee Richie got to watch his latest video that it was
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.480]   really good with the two Apple Silicon engineers fascinating fascinating fascinating.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:59.520]   Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRichy. Our show today brought to you by userway.org.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.120]   My heart is with this company because they're doing something so important. I remember when
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.760]   you know we've had websites forever websites you may or may not know are considered
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:18.720]   by all in sundry public entities. And as a result you are bound by the rules of the Americans
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.880]   with disabilities act the ADA. That's why your website has to be accessible. Now when I found
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.000]   that out I thought oh this is going to be painful this is going to be tough.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.160]   Then I found userway not only easy one line of JavaScript but very affordable.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.920]   Userway is an incredible AI powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of Wukag
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.880]   guidelines created by the world wide web consortium. With just one line of JavaScript
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.600]   userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers. It's not just the law it's the right
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:59.280]   thing to do. 60 million users are out there who want to use your site but if it's not accessible
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.320]   they can't. The way browsers work I actually was talking to the userway folks I had to understand
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.280]   this is that when you're using a browser and you're sighted and you know you're looking at it
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.920]   you're seeing that kind of front rendering of a page. But every browser creates an accessibility
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.800]   layer as well for screen readers and people with disabilities. It's really important that
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.240]   your website support that accessibility layer. That's why more than a million websites use
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:32.880]   userways AI and machine learning solutions to power their accessibility. I'm talking Coca-Cola
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:40.000]   I'm talking Disney eBay FedEx many leading brands. Userways now making their best in class enterprise
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.040]   level accessibility tools available to small and medium sized businesses as well. And of course the
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.720]   nice thing is you may be small today but if you get big don't worry userway can scale with you
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.080]   if it works for Disney it's got to work for you right. It's just makes business sense to have an
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:04.000]   accessible compliant website. The Achilles heel for websites registration forms often just impenetrable
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.080]   to screen readers. Nav menus shopping carts that aren't accessible. Why would you make it impossible
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.720]   for anybody not to buy something on your site. But millions of users require userway to purchase
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:23.920]   your products. Userways AI actually generates image alt tags. It writes the descriptions for you.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.680]   But it also gives you access you get a complete report of everything userways done. It's easy for
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:34.560]   you even interactively to change the alt tags or to add to the alt tags. It'll remediate complex
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.720]   nav menus. All your pop-ups will be accessible. It'll fix vague link violations any broken links.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.600]   It even makes sure you're using web accessible colors which is actually fairly important.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:52.160]   But it doesn't but it's still true to your brand. Your brand's colors are preserved. They just
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.520]   change the luminance and the saturation to make them more accessible. You'll also get a detailed
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.760]   report of all the violations that were fixed on your site. Check out their free scanning tool. Go
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:08.640]   to userway.org/twit. See if your site's ADA compliant. It works with everything WordPress Shopify.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.960]   Wix is very easy to add, very cost effective. Same goes for AEM, for Site Core, for SharePoint.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.680]   Just a single line of JavaScript code and you're good to go. All you have to do is ask the voice
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.960]   of Siri. Consider the world's most popular voice assistant. Userway is trusted by more than 1

[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:38.880]   The battle is on between Apple and courts, Congress, the Department of Justice, and the EU.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:48.560]   South Korea. Everybody. South Korea has already said Apple has to open their iPhones to third party
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.720]   markets, marketplaces. Do you see how Google addressed that? Exactly the way everyone thought
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.440]   Apple would manage to do it first. What did Google say? They said, yeah, you can use
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.480]   alternate payments. You just got to hear the address to send us your chair of the revenue.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:09.120]   Yeah, well, Apple said they would do as well. Yeah. Yeah. Craig Federighi speaking at a web
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:19.040]   conference, web summit 2021 in Lisbon last week. I love his slide here. Side loading is a cyber
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:26.720]   criminals best friend. I think this might be a little ramped up rhetoric side loading.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.760]   Craig said as a cyber criminals best friend and requiring that on the iPhone would be a
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:39.040]   gold rush for the malware industry that one provision in the DMA that's the proposed
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.160]   European Commission's proposed digital markets act that one provision in the DMA could force
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.960]   every iPhone user get ready folks into a landscape of professional con artists constantly trying to
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:16:00.400]   fool them. Oh, come on, Craig. I would say that iOS zero days are the scammers best friend, but you
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.560]   know, what do I know? Well, those are the worst camera. This would democratize it.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.640]   It's democratizing. Having access to the same sort of tax as the nation's day. That's just not fair.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.320]   Tim Cook talking at the deal book summit from New York Times deal book summit said,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.520]   quote, I think that people have that choice today. Andrew, if you want a sideload, you could buy
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:28.480]   an Android phone. He's okay. Done. Okay. Did it? Did got it right here? Did that choice exists
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.240]   when you go to the center of the carrier shop? If it's important to you, you should buy an
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.560]   Android phone from our point of view. It would be like if I were an automobile manufacturer
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.840]   telling a customer not to put airbags and seat belts in the car, he would never think now,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:48.400]   wait a minute. No iPhone has ever killed anybody as far as I know whether it's got sideloading or not.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.600]   He would even when you drop it on your head in bed, like it doesn't kill you, it just makes you
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.720]   wish you were dead for a second. But this is actually, you could make this case with jail
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.720]   breaking, right? But this is actually even more ramped up than anything Apple said about jail
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.760]   breaking. He said, I would never think about doing this in today's time. It's just too risky
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.480]   to do that. It would not be an iPhone if it didn't maximize security and privacy.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:20.480]   Is this true? Or is this a little overheated? I don't disagree with the argument that
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.440]   the fact that the iPhone lacks the ability to sideload apps makes it more secure in that way
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:35.840]   than an Android phone. They did release that white paper, of course, backing up that standard.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:42.080]   However, it's largely true. It's not like it's all snake oil. You have to do it. You should
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.960]   point out that a lot of the studies that they're pointing to about the malware situation in
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.840]   Android, its vectors and its sources, all of it the data is like four or five years old.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:18:02.240]   So my mom bought a iPhone Cleaner app that charged her $7 a week. It was approved by Apple.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.760]   It was on the app store. Apple took their 30% of the $7. If I hadn't had notifications on my
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.360]   email set up on mine, I would never have known she bought that.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.000]   That's this way. It could happen without Apple getting a cut Leo.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.120]   Oh, yeah. There you go. Oh, what was I thinking? There's scams. There's lots of scam apps on the
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.760]   app store. Lots of subscription scam apps. Yeah. Yeah. And plus people who are trying,
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.440]   nation states are trying to get into the phone. They're not necessarily trying to get you decide
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.200]   load apps. They are they have other ways of doing that that involve just sending a text message
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.120]   that that doesn't have to be read. You can do what Google does, which is say, if you turn this on,
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.160]   your risk, Apple Google has a big announcement. They even turn it off now after you download
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.880]   whatever it is you wanted. Yeah. Most people I would venture to say, I'd love to see the numbers,
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.120]   but I bet you very few people ever sideload anything on Android. Yeah, that's why that's why I think
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:59.760]   Sue is. Yeah. I mean, if it worked, Epic wouldn't need to worry about it, right? No.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.360]   Yeah. They're referring to a just a very good thing. They're referring to a couple of scams where
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.000]   they the person who's trying to infect the phone talks you went to. Oh, by the way, you're going to
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.840]   hear how to walk you into walk you through the security settings you need to have in order to
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.920]   install this wonderful app or we're going to give you for free. And that's well, somebody named
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:26.320]   iPhone Cleaner talked to my mom into thinking she needed a $7 a month program to clean iPhones.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.200]   Well, that actually occurred about exfiltrating data as well. So you go like there's just multiple
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:40.160]   vectors for this. Yeah. I mean, you have no idea how much danger you're in of your sideloading.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.200]   So sure, you can let people decide load. They're just idiots to do it.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   Yeah. And if I go to Adobe to side load, I don't think I'm not eating it.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.440]   But so this is the problem. You're just pointed out exactly the problem,
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:57.360]   which is that if you set sideloading or allow sideloading on the iPhone, then the user is going
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.080]   to have choices taken away from them because companies like Adobe or someone else is going to say,
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.040]   I'm going to force everybody to sideload my application. You can't have my application as a,
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.960]   you know, whether it's Fortnite or whatever, the user can't have that application if they don't
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.040]   have if, you know, right now the user who pays for everything, right? Remember, the user is the
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.480]   one right in the checks. So, so that they have a stake in this in this that what we paid for was
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:26.400]   a walled garden that is easy for us to use. And we are the ones paying for it. So, so the thing
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:32.320]   is is that it is that they are taking that away from us where we suddenly have some apps that are
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.720]   sitting on the outside of that is when little apps are doing it, you know, it's fine. But when,
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.160]   you know, Fortnite or Adobe starts to do it, what happens is it puts that pressure for people to go
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.120]   ahead and go ahead and download it. And then they're out in the, you know, out in the wind, you know,
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.960]   and and Apple, I think Apple is doing two things here. One is obviously they're going to try to make
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:57.520]   their case, but they're also putting stakes in the ground. You know, the when people, not if this is
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.720]   if sideloads are created, there will be hacks that are used utilizing that. And when they do it,
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.360]   Apple's putting very public stakes in the ground that they're going to use to burn politicians with,
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.680]   you know, and so the thing is, is that, you know, by saying all this stuff right now, what they're
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:17.840]   doing is I mean, because the politicians, you know, generally, when properly oriented is oriented
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.120]   towards the consumer to the customer. None of the customers are calling for this.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.720]   Why hasn't this happened on the why hasn't this happened on Android then Alex? Why isn't it like
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.200]   everything goes on Android? Because there's no money in Android. There's no money.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.000]   There's no money for apps on Android. But Adobe doesn't force side loading on Android.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.280]   Adobe doesn't say, Oh, yay, we don't have to pay 30%. Because because no one no one on Android pays
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.840]   for apps, you know, so it's like, it's not a it's not a good market for that, you know. And so the
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.800]   thing is, is that it's so I think that, you know, they obviously, what everyone wants is, you know,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:57.680]   the Android, you know, atmosphere is not is not conducive. You know, that's why people launch on
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:02.000]   the iPhone. And so everyone wants access to that. And the thing is, if they want access, then play
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.760]   inside those play inside the rules that were set up, you know, that 10 years ago. And you don't
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:12.480]   like that with Android with the region locks like we had we had huge problems that on Android
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.960]   Central, whenever a game company region locks something like Pokemon Go would come out in Canada,
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.000]   not the US or a few countries, people would there were so many sideloading schemes or people would
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.960]   just copy the APX file, put it up. I forget the APK file. Sorry, the APK file put it up with
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.800]   malware and people were getting hit left right and so it's not a unique problem.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.080]   That was a malware, um, sideload with Fortnite.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.760]   My whole thing is that like, um, you know, there's very few mainstream friendly operating systems,
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.160]   very few, most operating systems are really nerdy. Like that includes Mac OS, that includes Unix
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.560]   Linux, um, Android, Windows, all of these things. There's like iOS and Chrome OS, like for mainstream
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.360]   people, for people who really just want convenient computing appliances. And it feels like we just
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.520]   don't want them to have it. We want to take it away from them and say, no, this has to be a computer
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.480]   too. It's like, I pay PC games. I'm offended that you want to PlayStation five or an Xbox.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.240]   Therefore, I'm going to force your PlayStation five or Xbox to be a computer like, no, no,
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.320]   I don't want a computer. I just really want to play my Nintendo switch. Just let me play my,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.880]   no, I'm going to make that into a computer for you. And I think I just let the market, like if people
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.360]   were flooding to Android, Apple would be forced to change. I think right now there's like one
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.520]   category, two categories of apps that you can't get on iOS, that you can get on Android, but they're
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:31.760]   not in sufficient demand. Like game streaming services, which I think Apple is completely future
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.000]   blind about. They should be allowing those absolutely. That's a competitive advantage for
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.120]   Android right now, that and fake virus scanning apps, because that people think that they need
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.040]   those. So that whole category exists on Android and not on Apple. And I'd be super happy if that
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:50.720]   went away completely. But otherwise, it seems like it's hurting a lot of people rather than
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:58.240]   helping them. I think it's hurting Apple to ramp up the rhetoric with this BS language.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.040]   It's much like Congress saying, because think of the kids.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.880]   They're pandering to their terrorists. Apple says the terrorists win too. If sideloading is
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:12.640]   allowed, the terrorists win. I think it's a very big mistake for Apple to go that far down that road.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.280]   Apple can make you can make your case about right to repair. And you can make your case about
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:24.160]   sideloading without using these overwrought. The issue is not like saying, oh, we're to sell a car
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.960]   without airbags. That's complete BS. What they're what they're doing is seating the ground. So when
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.520]   it does happen, the people went it's in people's head. I don't think so. I think they want these
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.040]   things not to pass. They're trying to keep these things. They don't want them to pass. But if they
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.720]   pass, they want to make sure people feel it. But I think that what we don't what we haven't talked
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.760]   about in the EU is that this this law that they're talking about, it's very much up in the air. It
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:53.760]   is a bone a contention amongst the EU state. You think about how they think about two countries in
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:02.080]   the EU who very, very much want the status quo because they're Luxembourg and Ireland,
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.280]   countries where companies are hiding their money, their profits from app stores. There are also a
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.000]   lot of factions inside. They're saying this law goes too far. They're once they say this doesn't
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.560]   go far enough. There has been some speculation that it could take a couple of years for any
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.520]   sort of consensus to be reached. So the ball is very, very much in play. And if Apple plays the
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.560]   play's a PR game very, very successfully and kind of arms their user base to say hey,
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.280]   look, to have intelligent people like people on this panel saying that, hey, look, this is
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:38.080]   Tim is being a little bit overblown. He's being a little bit hysterical. But at the
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.800]   root, the first five seconds of what he said was absolutely right. If I wanted to have side loading,
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   I have the option of having excellent Android phones. I don't want side loading, so I'm buying
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.800]   iPhone. So that's I think that's why this rhetoric is going in. And it's also happening
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.440]   at the same level at which they're pursuing every other rhetoric, such as saying that this is why
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.000]   this is why we can't accept payments outside the app store. This is why we have to charge money for
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.240]   if you if you buy a comic book, if you saw a comic book through a through an app that's
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.280]   conducted through the app store, they have to defend their their dogma to the end until they're
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.960]   forced to do something. And when they're forced to do something, they will do it. Before that,
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:18.480]   they will absolutely argue vehemently, passionately and rapidly that this will cause the down the
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.560]   downfall of all mankind. The eighth seal will be broken. We will see rivers of blood, horses on
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.600]   fire running down the street. And do we want that? No, we don't. And this is why we must not pass this
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:36.080]   law. Last week on Wednesday, the Commerce Department added the NSO group, the Israeli company that
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.560]   provides malware to foreign nations so they can break into iPhones. They added them to their
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:50.000]   entity list for malicious cyber activities. Israel's very upset about this. The government
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.560]   Israel considers the software a crucial element of its foreign policy. Really. And is lobbying
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:04.080]   Washington to remove them from the blacklist. NSO says, of course, that the software is intended
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:14.480]   merely to help countries combat organized crime and terrorism. Okay. It was just found by the way,
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:21.680]   on six Palestinian activists phones. So you can just add it add the list, you know, to the
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:29.120]   journalists in Bahrain. The receipts don't match the purchases, sadly. Yeah. Apple, I'm sure does
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.760]   everything they can to block NSO groups software, but they seem not to be having a much success at
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.720]   that every time they the problem is you've got, unfortunately, you've got very, very, very talented
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:49.600]   hackers, security analysts who realize they can sell this for millions of dollars in NSO
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   group. Very rich nation states that one NSO group sells along to rich nation states.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.440]   And so it's, you know, it despite all of the, you know, the the companies like Zorodiam are
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.880]   offering bonuses and and Apple itself offers bug bounties. These don't come close to the amount
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.320]   of money. I'm sure the NSO group offers through the processes. That's an apple. That's an apple
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.880]   could be a little bit better at handing those things out. Remember that we've had that one of the eight
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:20.960]   lace gondolas of 2021 was, Hi, I reported this bug a while ago, you promise you're going to get
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.360]   to them and also credit me. You did neither. Even though he said three times you're going to do that.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.880]   What the hell boy, it would behooves them at this point, given you're competing with the NSO group to
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:38.320]   do to do right by security. Cost years level service. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Take take one of
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.120]   our unsold $12,000 go Solgo gadget watches. We still got 18 of them that we have to move.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:49.200]   Kanye just sent his back. So maybe 19. I don't know. No, I'm making that up. I don't know what
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:29:01.840]   you did with his watch. Apple's iOS 15.2 is out in beta two. One of the things it adds is an ability
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:10.640]   to scan for nearby air tags and find my enabled items. There's some communications safety features.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.760]   This sounds like I'm actually impressed with that. Is this the parental thing that they were
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.200]   going to roll out? Yeah, but they made a major change to it. The biggest pushback against this
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.280]   is the communication stuff. It's not the CSAM scanning. This is the part that uses machine learning
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.560]   on device to identify new or sexually inappropriate images for devices that have been enrolled in
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:36.800]   parental controls and are identified as belonging to a child. It can be set up so that it will alert
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.640]   you if it gets one of those images and you have to tap through to see it. They'll say this image
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.400]   contains nudity. You tap. It's going to say, are you sure you want to see it? Let me read you.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.560]   We've got the pictures. This is from nine to five Mac. This is from iOS again, 15.2 in the beta two.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.280]   This photo could be sensitive. Now this is aimed at the kid, right? Are you sure you want to view
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.120]   naked photos and videos that show the private body parts that are usually covered by underwear
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:07.120]   or bathing suits? It's not your fault, but naked photos and videos can be used to hurt you.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.880]   This, the person in this might not want it to be seen. It could have been shared without permission.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:21.680]   Now do you want to see it? And then if you say yes, it's your choice, but by the way, it's got the
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.600]   monocle guy, the monocle guy. We're very disappointed. We're very disappointed.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.320]   But make sure you feel safe. Don't share anything you don't want to talk to someone you trust. If
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:35.760]   you feel pressured to view naked photos or videos, you're not alone. And you can always talk with
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.000]   someone who's trained to help. And then there's a button that says message or grown up.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.280]   Under don't view. Now the grown up will be notified if you view it, right?
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.560]   No, so that's the big change because people previously complained that the previous system
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:55.040]   would allow a parent to force it to notify them if one of those images were received.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.240]   And the concern was that it could outchildren or anyone who's non hetero,
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:04.080]   or anyone who has remember abusive other ones. No system that's looking for nude photos is
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.800]   perfect. And so there will be photos false negatives, false positives, I should say.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.960]   Yes, but also they could actually be nude photos, but that could have a very complicated
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:18.320]   relationship with their parents or their own sexuality, which is nobody's business.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.840]   It's a very complicated issue. But now it no longer has that, you can no longer force a
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:29.040]   notification. The child can choose to go get help if they want to. And Apple will provide help
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.840]   beyond just the family. If the family is a really big threat as well. But nothing is being
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.320]   exfiltrated from your device, no knowledge is being sent out of your device. And to me,
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.800]   that's not only are they listening, but they're understanding why it was a concern, which is not
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.640]   always a case. Yeah, I thought the original layout of this was going to be that the
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:55.760]   privacy was going to be protected if the child is 13 or older, but they couldn't get around it
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.920]   if they were 12 or younger. Do they change the age limit? No, and now it's protected no matter
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.120]   what age you are. Okay, got it. Yeah, that's that that is very wise that that was one of the largest,
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:14.720]   as Renee says, you can't protect parents want to know everything, but not all parents are responsible
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.960]   enough to react well to everything. And that would have put children in danger. Apple should not be
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.920]   in the business of making parents a police state. But there are and there are third parties that
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:28.480]   provide those kinds of tools, I presume, yes. And parents can take the phone. I mean, like that the
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:35.040]   parents have control over their kids. It's not Apple's job to do that. Yes. Apple's not our parent.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.640]   Right. Guess what? Guess what? You're getting a flip phone, you'll still be able to text me to
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.480]   get a ride. You'll still be able to text me if you're in an emergency, you will not be you'll enjoy
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.240]   that 140 pixel by 120 pixel camera and no data plan. But that's what you're getting there.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.800]   There's all we can get ahold of our kids as long as they're on as on at the school,
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.440]   because they have Wi-Fi. But I don't give them a. Oh, that's smart. Yeah. Yeah, so they have phones,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.560]   they just don't have do you worry that they've way wander off and get lost or something that now
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.360]   what are they going to do? I just don't I got a 911. Yeah, they haven't wondered. Yeah, they haven't
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:14.720]   wondered haven't wondered off yet. Well, because at that home, they got all these incredible computers
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:20.320]   on VR hardware and brushes and you're talking to someone I ran away for a weekend and came back
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:25.840]   and my mom just asked if I had fed the horses that morning. It didn't even miss me. She didn't
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.440]   even know what I was gone. So, wait a minute, you had to feed horses. We raised quarter horses.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:36.240]   Oh, I don't know that. So, gosh, I thought I knew everything about you. You raised quarter horses.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:43.680]   Yeah, so I so I we raised race horses and wow and yeah, so and so anyway, so we had these
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:50.640]   so I ran away. You know, I was angry. I was like, I don't know, 12 and 12 years old, I ran away
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.920]   for the weekend away into the woods. I was went camping at a squirrel and I was I'm built to lean
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.920]   to I was pretty. Any of the Andy squirrels be resourceful when I was a kid and and and just
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.120]   lived lived off the land and then came back on Sunday triumphant waiting for everyone to be
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.440]   like totally in tears that I had been gone since Friday afternoon and yeah, my mom just asked if
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.360]   I had fed the horses she did. I asked her later. I was like, did you did you do that just as a
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.280]   psychological like psych scyops on me? She's like, she's like, I don't remember you running away.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:27.120]   Wow. So, wow, oldest of six kids, you know, and we have lots of cousins. So, she just assumed I was
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.920]   at one of my cousin's house. She had spears. That was what she told you. It's fine. I know.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:37.120]   Go ahead. Maybe you'll come back. Wow. Extra bacon for the other kids.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:43.920]   Exactly. Maybe you could tell mom about this. iOS 15 to beta two lets your family access your
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.640]   data if you pass away from eating a bad squirrel.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:53.200]   It was good. It was just a little bit. I would squirrel was a little chewy.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.200]   Yeah. Yeah. It was a little chewy. But you need to braise it before you roast it.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.360]   I cooked it. I know. I should have come on. Well, he did throw a saucy beaugele into his backpack
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.320]   before he spread out. So, the sauce wasn't as heavy as he'd like. But you know what? It's
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.960]   squirrel. That is one of the greats delicacy. I will admit, I will know that was the only thing I
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.480]   ate. And then I decided I'd just go back to the sea rats that I already have. Like I had a
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.480]   bunch of sea rations and I was like, these are better. They're much else. Stay away from hunting.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.760]   Yeah. The deal's ready to eat. Oh, it's a good choice. Yeah. This is the legacy contact feature
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:34.320]   that was, I think rumored to be launched with iOS 15, they held off. It is going to be available
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.280]   and 15.2. It is available down the beta too. You can add a legacy contact. This is a good thing to do
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:46.800]   because you could get hit by a bus no matter what age you are. So, I got so dark so quickly.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:54.080]   I, you know why I get calls. I was on the farm. Like, yeah, that wasn't dark. No, no,
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.440]   this is the world. And the mother not really knowing or caring where you're with them.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:03.200]   I just took it where you started. See, that's all. I was going on down that road.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.640]   My family, that's just good. I actually get calls on the radio show fairly frequently from
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:16.000]   survivors who say, I can't get into this device and I'd like to and so forth. Now,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.560]   the problem is, of course, after the person's passed, you can't get their permission. And there
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:26.560]   may, you know, not everybody wants you rooting around in their phone. So this way, you can before
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:33.360]   you pass at a legacy contact that can access and download data from your account after your death.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.520]   The friends or family will have added, they have added you as your legacy contact.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:43.280]   Well, I don't know if they'll have to, what they'll, what hoops they'll have to jump through.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:50.400]   John will be able to, John, whoever John is, I guess John is the guy. You, I'm, you're my legacy
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.240]   contact. John will be able to access the data stored in your account after your death. The data
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.240]   in your account may include photos, messages, notes, files, contacts, calendar events, apps you've
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.840]   downloaded, device backups, and your nude photos. John won't know I added that. John won't be able
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:10.880]   to access your iCloud keychain or any licensed media because DRM survives death. I just want
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.640]   everybody to know your digital media can't be be quilt. We can't be because there's no concierge
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.720]   service to go through and delete all the embarrassing music on your playlist. Like all those raffy
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.280]   albums that you can sing that you can listen to on repeat. Oh, my British beer collection.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:32.640]   I don't know if it's on the show notes, but Apple is a target of a class action suit on the,
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.960]   once again, on the buy button in the, in the iTunes store and the, and the Apple, the digital
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.920]   stores, because of that exact same issue that we're bringing up that you're not buying it because
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:47.760]   I can't leave this copy of Wonder Woman 1984 to my children and I can't sell to anybody else.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:51.440]   Therefore, it's not buying something. Yeah. It's so much worse than that. It's so much worse than
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.120]   that. You can't miss your credit card payments with the App Store. So if you, you know, like I,
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.520]   I had lost my credit card. I lost my credit card that was attached to my App Store and I wasn't
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:05.520]   paying attention and everything else and it went out or whatever. And suddenly I couldn't watch any
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:10.480]   movies. Like you said, no, you can't watch it. Like it's until you pay your bill. Wow, they got you.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:16.640]   You cannot. They got you. You cannot watch anything. So it's, which is that is certainly bad. Like,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.800]   it's certainly bad of Apple because it's like if I paid for that, I should be able to not buy
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.800]   anything new. I get that part but not but turning off 500 plus movies because I didn't that I paid for
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:33.920]   for that is not not nice. So there's a, I guess there's an access key that your,
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:39.680]   your legacy contact gets but you'll also need to provide a death certificate for you to access.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.840]   I was wondering about that. I was like, how do they know you're dead? Yeah. You could tell
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:50.640]   come up with the phone and say, I know you said well, I hope you trust the coroner. Okay. Wow.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:57.440]   Any other features and 50? And does this mean 15 two is imminent? Bated two is usually not quite
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.360]   to the end of the. No. So we got a few more to go. It's one of the new.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.200]   Really hitting that we know they're seriously.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:10.320]   There you go. It's what drives the upgrades. Yeah, no kidding. People are simple. We
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.280]   overcomplicate it but people are really simple at our hearts. We like our new emojis. That's
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.800]   what gets us to upgrade. It's one of your fancy features. I'm not live text. This new emojis.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.160]   The new poop emoji has a certain swagger that we just, this was so in tune with a post
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.320]   COVID world, I think. We wait for the emojis to go. The brand new updates right away gets you
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:29.760]   the box. Like you get that box on social media and you don't know what that emoji is and that
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.840]   is, I can't have an emoji that I don't have and then you'll upgrade immediately. You ready for the
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.480]   emojis to go into the into the into motion so that you can sit there and build animations with
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.080]   your emojis and then you could see why USDZ emojis. Yeah, yeah. The Apple Watch used to have
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.760]   animated emojis and they've kind of deprecated those over time and then the Windows 11 ones that
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:53.120]   look like they might be animated kind of ended up not. Is this a new before they should have
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.920]   a screen capture this? Is this a new feature that came with Monterey? I have now, I'm using
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:10.480]   emomemoji for my ID on my when I log in right and it's animated and it looks at you and if you type
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:17.040]   your password wrong it goes. Is that new? That's awesome.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.480]   Instead of the shit, you know, it's like you were in the shape of password like, uh uh. That was
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.760]   really good interaction though. That was really good interaction design at the time because it
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:32.880]   told you exactly. Oh yeah. Now your little emoji make your everybody should make their ID on their
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:40.320]   Apple account. Emoji, mine has a little Mexican hat on it to celebrate and uh and it goes no.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:45.280]   It's trying to shake the hat off. And it looks at you and when you when you're
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.160]   start typing it looks down at your typing it's it's it's all alive. Oh I should have screen
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.560]   capture. It should look down and it should look down and as soon as you look up at it it looks away.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.040]   I think the animation part might be new but I don't have a I have to add that now.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.360]   Emoji is like the slowest boiling the frog AR technology Apple has been investing in.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.320]   It's like everyone's going to be so used to having an emoji by the time we all have
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:12.800]   avatars. It's not going to be a problem. Let me see if uh if anybody has uh there's somebody's
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:19.040]   got a post to this right. Um if they haven't man I'm gonna I'm gonna go just log in out of my
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.160]   knife. I guess this is a this is uh a feature. You have emoji on login. This was one of the
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.400]   things that Apple announced when they announced Monterey. See it is in there one of the slides
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.280]   there emoji on login. It's got a hat too. So you're so unvogally. Oh man. Your drip.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:39.280]   Play with it. I'm telling you play with it. It's so much fun. It does. It's it's very expressive.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.120]   I'm non-conformist. I never changed my username. I never changed my profile not for Halloween
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:51.040]   not for Christmas. Like I I just it'd be weird. I want to see if I can play the frown.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:59.360]   Uh yeah here's use my mojama clock screen. Let me see if this from Mac Observer. Let me see if they
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:07.200]   uh if they show what it looks like. Have your back. I don't know if they maybe not. Yeah. No
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.280]   this is a big. This is just how is this not over to talk. Yeah. I don't. Oh yeah. There there's
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.120]   like that. This guy's name is Jeff Butts. Yeah. See he's looking why you type and if you type it
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:26.240]   wrong what is what is. Oh no. Oh my god. You're so disappointed. It's like it's like remember the
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.200]   early GPS systems where if you missed a turn and be like oh no. Oh no. Like so does the win.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:37.760]   I'm being re-routing. So I think this is one of the best features of Monterey. I'm sorry that
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.520]   your happiness and self. Your happiness and stability is so fragile that my mistyping fat
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:50.720]   fingering a password will just devastate you like that. Let's talk about you. Hey this is hello.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.120]   Uh you remember and I was very reluctant to show it. The schematics that were leaked from Apple's
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:06.400]   uh uh Quanta supplier uh they were uh uh was the Reville gang that got it. Um actually by the way
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.720]   now that I've got one of these I'm looking at it and the schematics were actually pretty right on so
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.800]   uh I guess I guess they were accurate but we didn't want to show them because it seemed like it was
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:22.080]   the old gotten game. Well the old gotten game got got because the the the uh Reville folks are
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.440]   robbed and they did go down. Allegedly being arrested the DOJ and ask one alleged member of the group
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.880]   has been arrested and charged in relationship with their attack against Casea and then uh
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:41.360]   Ukrainian national uh and then I believe six more were arrested affiliates and it is thought that
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:48.000]   one of them is the person who released these Quanta designs. So don't mess with Apple kids.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.760]   They got their own security force and they will hunt you down.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:59.360]   Um actually I'm very glad they got these guys uh because ransomware has just gotten so
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.760]   out of control. Reville was absolutely uh the worst and uh was doing some real damage out there
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:11.360]   and uh it looks like they're getting punished for which they ought to be. I hope it's you know I'm
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.240]   sure you know again. Allegedly. This was this wasn't this wasn't this wasn't wasn't journalist
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:20.640]   working sources and breaking a story. This was criminals who were trying to hold the company's
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.800]   IP. Absolutely. Yeah. And then basically proving that they that they knew business but so yeah they
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.840]   they they need to go away for a while. Remember we we mentioned that Netflix is going to start
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.520]   doing games. They've launched their first selection of games on iPhone and iPad. Uh you could sign
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.040]   up with an in-app purchase. I'm not I don't I guess they're games that tie. I hate that they have to
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:47.920]   be separate games. Yeah. It annoy like it annoy like Netflix is they don't make Netflix for all the
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.760]   movies and iTunes. Why make them put all the games in the app store? It just does so. That's how
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:57.680]   you have to do it. They've got a stranger things 1984 stranger things three shooting hoops card
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:04.080]   blast teeter up. I think there's a squid game mobile game coming if there isn't there ought to be.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.920]   And I also I know why they do it but I hate when like executives talk about it. We have we have to
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.720]   better exploit our IP. We have all these IP. How do we better exploit them? It just makes it feel
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:18.240]   like it's not at all about any creativity or audience. Well I'm sorry. The history of these
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.400]   you know tie in games is terrible. I mean the worst game in all history was ET for the Atari.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:33.040]   So you didn't like that game. I have a cartridge. Have you played it? I have a cartridge. You can
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.520]   play it. Then you want to play it. I gave one of my that came out during my pitfall times.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:45.200]   My pitfall Harry. That was a game pitfall. And then I was I was Caratica 100% on the
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.200]   on the Apple II. I'm sorry. For me app on the Apple II is yeah. I went to pitfall from the Apple
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:57.440]   II and Aztec Aztec on the Apple II was there. I remember that was my jam. I got to interview
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.080]   when he talked. I got to interview Jordan McNerney talked about how the Apple II couldn't handle
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.080]   simultaneous pixel movement and audio. So he had to split between every action. One for the audio,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.080]   one for the screen, one for the audio, one for the screen. He went on to write Prince of Persia
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:18.080]   which is another. He invented the cut scene. Yeah. He invented the cut scene. Wow. Yeah. Wow.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.640]   There's so much oral history that needs to be written down about this sort of stuff. I agree.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.280]   Because it's hard to it's hard to it's hard to explain exactly how
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:34.720]   what a breakthrough Caratica was seeing that level of fluid animation in a game as opposed to like
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:41.280]   with as opposed to with like Wolfenstein at the time of Aztec. You got animation so you could follow
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.480]   what's going on. It was pretty good. But it wasn't like my god, how are they getting this fluid
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:52.000]   life like sort of characters going through and else but the but the favorite thing was about it.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.640]   It was a double sided disc but the game was like was really just on one side of it. But if you did
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:02.720]   like boot it off the other side it would play backwards. That's pretty funny. Well, you know
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.880]   the funny thing is I was a friend of mine's got him Steve Wright and he worked at Atari.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.680]   And he was he was working on one of the teams and they put this little thing in that if you did this,
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.360]   you know, if you pushed it, you went this way and then that way and then up, it would show you
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:21.280]   this little this little extra thing. Oh, I love these tricks. Atari went crazy. They were so upset.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.840]   Yeah. They were there so upset and he had to go up to the executives and explain it and he explained
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.280]   that he goes, you know, it's something special that you could find, you know, like an Easter egg.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.440]   He that was the first time it was like, he was like, like an Easter egg. And that's how he was
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.360]   famous because they didn't want to give credit to their programmers knowing full well that it would
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.720]   cost them money in the long run if these people became famous. So that's why people put Easter eggs
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.440]   in at first was just to give himself credit. That's that's also how electronic arts got launched
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.280]   that they were basically saying we were we're going to produce packages. It looks like albums.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.360]   We were going to credit all the authors. And that's how it got some of the best people.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:03.040]   But we could write that book ourselves, Renee. Let's just with our memories.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:11.200]   So I'm browsing around on John Miranda, I'm thinking maybe I should buy a teakwood table and 900 bucks
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:16.960]   or I don't know. There's some good stuff a pair of Hans Jorgensen, Wagner, lounge chairs for it.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:26.640]   For 47 50, not bad. And then I see this listing number 2063, the chaffy college apple one personal
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:34.560]   computer. And by the way, with the original bite shop, coa wood case, we ain't just talking any old
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:43.600]   apple one. This has got a beautiful coa wood case connected to a beautiful 1986 Panasonic video
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:51.280]   monitor accompanied by a zero ox a period zero ox copy of the apple one basic manual,
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:58.720]   the apple one operations guide, the original Moss 6040 to 6502 programming manual. And not one,
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:06.080]   but two apple one software cassette tapes with period handwritten index card with memory locations
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.840]   so that you could load the software. So you know you know where to load that in very important.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:19.040]   Mel the tea coil. I love that. I love I love that they've got the entire language of like a big
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:25.680]   time auction. Plus it has the original spry 39. Yeah. That's not been restored has not been
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.320]   recapped. The three original video power and cassette is in your face. Million still.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:37.040]   It sold for 400,000 dollars. What a deal. Nice. What a deal.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.480]   Well, wait, you see, if only Steve Jobs and Wozniak admitted an NFT instead of making a computer,
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.560]   they would still have gotten royalties from the redistribution of this asset. Yeah.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.520]   That whoever whoever bought that they're going to be kicking themselves. I understand apples
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:57.440]   working on an apple to with integer basic built in. Well, and I applied, I didn't get that, but now
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:04.400]   I can apparently buy. I don't know. I don't know what this is. A spiral.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:11.840]   Oh my god. It's just it's just a French crafting curve. I think that's all it is.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:19.680]   Oh, it's signed by Rita McBride. Oh, there it is. Okay. It's a work of art.
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:25.920]   It's a work of art. They're they're bidding on that right now. Come bring your preconceptions to it.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.680]   We should have, you know, we blew it because they started this auction when we started the show
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.320]   for the apple one. It would have been kind of fun to watch that live.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.120]   You know, I was I was asking someone about NFTs and I was like, I don't understand that.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.840]   This is a couple of weeks ago because now I do because I was talking to them. They said, well,
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.640]   they said, well, someone sold a banana peel for a hundred sixty three thousand dollars. Like,
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.040]   like, you know, it's not. Yeah. It's it's it's all. Someone sold a JSON link. If someone sold a JSON
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.000]   link to an image of a banana that may or may not 404 when you follow it, but you have proof
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.840]   positive that you own the JSON. Yeah, we're talking. What was it? You see, this is this is why it's so
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.760]   crazy that like the fine arts community is saying, Oh, but this isn't legitimate. This isn't like
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.880]   the artwork that you're talking about, Alex. It's like this. Some guy at Basil, it was literally,
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:17.120]   they took a banana and duct taped it to the wall. Yeah. And someone paid 164,000 for it. And part
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:21.920]   of and later on, they had to be explained, well, what is the artwork? So, well, you can at some point,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:28.400]   the banana is going to rot. The artwork is not the rotting peel. The the artwork is your here's how
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:34.320]   you you source another banana and how you tape it. It's basically the concept of duct taping a
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:40.000]   banana wall is the 163. So I'm not going to knock it. If boy, did I get boy, did I get into the
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.160]   wrong? I guess you're going to be infrastructure of the web 3.0 world. But right now, it's just
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:49.200]   every hustler and two bit, you know, Conrad, imagine a baller all around them. And there was a great
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.680]   thread on Twitter earlier where someone is like, I got this picture of a monkey on the NFT for the
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.520]   picture. And the guy's like, no, you got a token to that picture. He's like, what? He's like, yeah,
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.960]   you bought the token to that picture. There'll be a million pictures. And he's like, what do you
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.760]   mean? Because isn't your bio say NFT consultant? He's like, no, don't you know about this? I thought
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:13.840]   I did. Hey, I'm not going to mock it. Kevin Rose owns a icon sized picture of a zombie.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.920]   And at last check, it was worth $400,000. He got it for a few hundred. So
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:24.640]   people, the people with money who are in earlier going to make a fortune and people in 10 years
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:29.200]   holding those exact same tokens are going to be a tiny bit. They're not going to have any value.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.280]   You know, but NFTs will be something that are involved in the. Yeah, except the underlying
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.920]   technology that and blockchain, they'll be useful for other things that don't involve speculation
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.280]   on on chimpanzee pixelated art. It's going to be super interesting.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:50.880]   Yeah. I think we should on that high note, take a little time out. And I will. Is this a catalog
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:53:00.000]   of Kevin Rose's NFTs? I believe it is. I think Mark Fronfelder learned how to do 3D modeling.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.600]   It is. Yeah, those were those were there was that was when NFTs were invented. There was like
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.720]   two prunks. Yeah. Yeah. Peripherable concept, like again, like collectibles. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.600]   And some people like, Oh, yeah, great. Yeah, I just paid like $80 for pixel art. And then
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:20.720]   oh, wow, it's worth how much? Oh my God, where did I what wallet did I store that token? And
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.760]   did I actually did I reformat that hard drive? Exactly. There was some people believe that the
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:31.680]   abundance of the lack of scarcity on the internet is a problem that NFTs can solve. Other people
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:37.040]   believe that the lack of scarcity is a feature that there's no known really needs it to be solved.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:41.920]   But you know, there is no digital collectible market. So we'll see it. Yeah. Why buy it? Why
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.200]   buy a bonsai? You have to water and take care of when you can just buy a picture of a bonsai.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.320]   Why buy a Pokemon card? You know, that's worth, you know, a holographic charizard card for $500,000
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:57.680]   and you can buy a JPEG of it or the JSON file that leads to it. J by the way, Alex, I can get the
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:02.160]   USDZ version of this if you would like. See, there you go. This is what I'm talking about.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.640]   Yeah. You're going to have sculptures. This is the next generation of sculpture.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:12.480]   It might be actually. It might well be. The funny thing is you could you could take a
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.760]   stone sculpture out of Zimbabwe. You could you could use object capture to turn it into a CG one.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.560]   And you could probably sell it for the same amount of money as the stone one.
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.720]   But as long as copyright, Alex, the person who made the original stone garden or the person
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.200]   who scanned it, I would keep the same person. I keep the same person. I would do it as a service.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.960]   Do it as a service to the artist who did the first one. Don't be a dork. That would be evil.
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:37.280]   Of course, someone will do it then because it's evil.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:43.760]   Prepare, my friends. Prepare your picks of the week. They're coming up next on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.760]   Meanwhile, a tip of the hat to our sponsor, Udacity, you know, honestly, you could you could invest
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:55.200]   in NFTs or you could actually get a skill that makes you marketable so that you can make a lot

[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.840]   success stories. Quote, Udacity, "arn me with skills to develop models and give me an innovative
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:42.240]   experience with quick, high quality recurring feedback." Aaron said Udacity's nano degree programs
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:47.200]   and career resource center played an integral part in helping me land a job offer from Google.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:54.960]   The top five nano degree programs right now, data engineering, product manager, data analyst,
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:01.360]   data scientist, and programming for data science with Python. If you're looking at again, the most
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.000]   cutting edge technology career you can get nano degree programs and things like AI, I would love
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.320]   to get a degree in flying car and autonomous flight engineer. Intro to self-driving cars,
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:19.440]   machine learning engineer, robotic software engineer. These are cutting edge careers with a real future.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.640]   And these aren't just made up because Udacity's courses are created with partners and industry

[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.040]   working right now in that field. When you sign up for a nano degree program with Udacity,
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.920]   courses are project based. It's active learning. I think that's so important. You're going to test
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:51.200]   your knowledge every step of the way. And it's not impersonal. Homework and projects are reviewed
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.240]   by qualified professionals. You're going to get real human feedback code reviews just like you'll
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:02.320]   get when you get that job with access to mentors 24/7. So you're never on your own. You can always

[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.720]   let's start at the top of the list. Alex Lindsay, what's your pick of the week?
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:32.960]   First of all, I have a little breaking news that showed up. Yes. Protocol. Unity, the competitor to
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:39.680]   Epic. Epic. It just bought WETA. WETA is of course the company that did the special
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:46.800]   sex for the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. Peter Jackson's WETA $1.63 billion.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:52.800]   So the visual effects doesn't come with it, I think, but all the technologies do. So all of
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:56.880]   their crowd and sends everything else. When we talk about AR. Do they have a lot of good technology?
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:03.840]   Do they have a lot? Yeah. Character technology. This is how you close the gap. Epic has been
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:09.600]   way ahead of them in this area. So it's a really good move for them. And I'm sure it gives
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:14.080]   WETA a bunch of extra cash. The Enco Wrecker's writing a protocol says this acquisition is poised
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:20.800]   to transform Unity into one of the biggest players in visual effects for blockbuster films and accelerate
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:26.000]   Hollywood's transition to virtual production and real-time technology.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.400]   Anyway, pretty exciting. Wow. Sating times.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:36.000]   That's kind of not what you would think of. Oh, good. You might think of WETA buying Unity,
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.200]   to be honest. No, well, Unity is like 20 times bigger than WETA. I guess so.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:48.640]   With all the AR stuff and the games and all the stuff that Unity does, with this kind of explosion,
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:54.000]   it's been a good time for them. I mean, it's why Apple can't buy them, because they're too expensive.
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:03.040]   Wow. And I presume that Mr. Jackson will get a little bit of that billions.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:10.720]   Yeah, probably. I think he's doing OK. He's a little hobbit hole somewhere in New Zealand.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:17.120]   Yeah, he's going to get another hobbit hole. Yeah, maybe get the whole town. Get the whole
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:23.040]   shire. What is your whole shire? So this is a project I worked on.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:27.600]   I wanted to show what we did. So this is the Clarity S node.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:33.120]   And what this is, it's pretty cool. And I'll talk about why I'm showing to you during Macbreak.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:38.720]   So what this does is it's an air quality monitor. And when they're, they used to be really big and
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:43.600]   take a long time to put out these air quality. So I have a purple in the house and a purple
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:48.320]   side after the fire, the industrial version. So this is like, this is the one that only,
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:56.080]   they only sell them municipal organizations like this. So this is like purple, but on steroids,
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:01.920]   you know, like it's, but it's, but what it does is it can provide real time data. It's solar and
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:06.080]   cellular. So you just kind of put it on a, on a lamppost and it starts to send data.
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.720]   And so anyway, so we, we built a video for them. But the thing that I wanted to show,
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.840]   because we were talking about this earlier, is so this is a, this is a USDZ model.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:25.920]   So you can see it here. And so we see a lot of toys that have been put up there as USDZ models.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.320]   But this is the real thing. This is why I get so excited about it is, oh, I want to look at this
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.200]   product. And now I can really take a look at all of the little bits and pieces of it. Now this is
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.720]   put together by Chris Fritche. I'll show you another model he built just as another example of it.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.880]   They actually say on the website, using an Apple device downloaded interactive 3D model.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:49.040]   So they actually took the 3D model that we built and put it on the website. So you can literally go
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.680]   to the website and download the product and put it right in front of you on your iPhone. And we
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.040]   made sure it works on the phone and everything else. And so, so it's, and all of the product
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:03.920]   pictures that you see on their, on their site, those are all created from the USDZ model. So
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.560]   instead of them having to go out and take photos and figure out, you know, like, and, you know,
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.480]   for a little company that's doing this, it's not, they're not little little, but they're, but they,
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.320]   you know, they don't want to have to go out and hire a photographer and do a photo shoot. And then
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.760]   they're only stuck with the shots that they paid someone a lot of money to do. For them,
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.920]   they're able to just move the object around and take another photo.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.400]   Right.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.920]   Like, you know, and, and just move it here. Okay, we want to take a photo here. We want to take a photo
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:29.920]   here.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:33.520]   All the product shots I think on, on the site are from your model.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.160]   No, no. Yeah. All of the product shots are from that model. Yeah.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:40.080]   So they're able to create those and they're able to keep, they'll be able to keep on creating them
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.320]   at will, you know, when they, you know, when, and so, but this is the, I think that Apple doesn't
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.760]   sell it, but I don't, maybe they're not trying it, but they're not showing you this, you know,
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:56.080]   which is you can really get, you know, high quality, you know, really high quality 3D models
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.480]   that, that you can pop open with your phone that you can use inside. This is what I'm showing this
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.080]   to you, by the way, I'm rotating this in preview. This is just Apple preview.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.520]   Oh, that's cool. I love that.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.000]   So I'm just, I'm literally a rotating around and I animated all of the things for their video
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.240]   inside of motion. So I took this object and just rotated, you know, just, just did all the
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:19.200]   animations inside of motion as a, as a, you know, for the actual, you know, for the video.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.000]   So, I mean, this is why I get excited about it. And I think I'm more excited about it because of
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.480]   this project. Now, you know, Chris, this is how the Zell Office Hours works. So, so we showed a
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.640]   little bit of this and we talked about it for like an hour, a little while ago. And then
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:44.400]   Keenan Campbell, who manages emergency response in Illinois, he wanted to use it for training.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:52.640]   And so here is something that they're working on right now. So this, again, this is not, this is,
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:59.120]   I opened this in preview, right? And so this is not, you know, and this one's a little too big right
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.280]   now to go into a phone. So you can't really use this as they are, but as a real time 3D,
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:08.560]   you know, seen here, you know, so Chris Fritchee, but he actually reverse engineered it from the
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:16.880]   actual photos that Keenan sent them. So, so the, but anyway, so this, but when you think about
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:21.920]   doing training before this was really hard, like, I mean, I've been doing this for a long time,
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:28.080]   30 years. And the idea that you, I can, in real time, just move this around in preview with the
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:33.120]   textures and lighting and everything else is, is why I get excited about it. And imagine again,
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.800]   you, you want to talk about this, you want to put it into, you can rotate it around to the place
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:41.360]   that you want it, render it out, put it into, into, into Keynote. But someday we're going to be able
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:45.760]   to, I think, that we're going to be able to put this just into Keynote. And, you know, we can,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:49.920]   you know, so this, you know, these are between these two. And again, this one is just something
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:54.240]   still work in progress. This one, you can actually, if you're watching, you can go to Clarity's
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:05:00.480]   website and download it and just put it on a desk in front of you. And it looks, you know, it
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:06.000]   looks like the real thing. Like we have, I tweeted out a picture last week of, of it sitting next
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.560]   to itself, the AR version, sitting next to itself. And, and, and it's, you know, that's the kind of,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.720]   you know, that's what's possible now. And, and I think that as, that's why folks like me get so
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:24.240]   excited about, about what, you know, what, what's possible is because here's the, here's the, by
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:35.840]   the way, this is the, if I was, this is, we put it. So, oh, there's the model, which is real thing.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:42.560]   Yeah. Yeah. So, so we just, and that's, that's actually a screen capture from my phone of that
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:47.600]   photo. And so I'm actually calling Henry's house. That's our counter. So anyway, so,
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:53.360]   but that is, but the two of them are right next to each other. And that's, but I, again, I don't
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:58.160]   think that that's what people see right now. When they see the little toys that Apple's been putting
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:02.400]   up, you know, that, that are there, when you really start to push the outer envelope and the
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.760]   reality is right now it's hard to build these, you know, so we had to figure, figure it out,
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:13.120]   which took a little bit of time, but now it's easy. So, so it's, so anyway, so, so I would, I would,
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:18.320]   if you want to see, like, again, when you think about companies using these as product shots and
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:21.760]   so on, so forth, I would go up to their website and check it out and download it. It's free.
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:27.600]   And you just download it off their, off their website and throw it in front of you. And you can,
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:32.240]   but I think that that's, that's what, that's why I get excited about USDZ is because of doing
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:38.000]   those kinds of models. Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.280]   Oh, you're muted. Is that us? Is that him? We don't know. That's me. Okay. I had my heart
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:52.240]   broken a while ago because I wanted to play Tetris. I wanted to have it on my phone. I decided that
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.880]   Tetris is definitely something my phone is capable of doing and was stymied by the fact that it is
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.240]   impossible to simply download and play Tetris on your phone by the way. Really?
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:06.800]   Ridiculous being ridiculous, Andy, because you're so right. It's such a horrible thing. Like, all I
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:11.760]   wanted to play the old Tetris. I don't want to play some crazy new fangled version that I have
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.880]   to play Tetris with. There's, there's, there's, there are three, there are only three options for
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:21.440]   you. You can buy, you can actually get the official Tetris, which is free, free, free,
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:27.120]   wonderful, but you have to watch like a long ad when you start long ads when you clear
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:32.320]   different levels. There are versions like Alex said, where no, no, no, it's 3D turbo network
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:37.840]   Tetris on this on the blockchain. Like, no, I just want Tetris. I want to, I want to hear that Russian
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:44.160]   music or you can get a knockoff that is certainly as simple as you want, but it probably also is
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:50.320]   like loaded with even more obtrusive ads. So I found, so I found a solution and believe it or not,
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:57.360]   the solution to be able to play Tetris on mobile is buying a $20 like Tetris little
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:05.360]   of this is called a micro micro arcade. And it is like the exactly Tetris on this tiny tiny little
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:11.200]   rechargeable device. And it actually plays exactly the way that you want it to play.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:16.240]   You'll unfortunately, you only get the music like for the first like round.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:19.200]   Oh, there it is.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:29.120]   But but it is your basic classic Tetris. It's in color. The screen is tiny, but it is Tetris is
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.480]   not a really visually complicated game. All you got to do is like rotate blocks and and drop them
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:40.560]   down. It works great. It gives me that's that kind of like calm sort of meditative flow that I'm
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:48.080]   used to with Tetris and no ads. I own it. It's it lasts almost I kind of like the fact that I can
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:53.120]   actually play it like for hours and hours and hours on battery without bringing down like my
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.040]   phone battery or like be interrupted with with like pop ups or notifications or anything like that.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:02.640]   I like I get so much that they actually have a whole line of these things.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:08.560]   Classic games. They have Dig Dug. This is this is a tag man. Oh, you bought one.
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.360]   Oh, this is the exact. Yeah, it is the exact like arcade. I don't know if they're running the
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:20.080]   exact arcade ROMs, but it is it has the attract screen. Now this one is kind of a challenge to play
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:25.600]   on this on this tiny tiny little screen, but you do.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:33.360]   Frogger. Yeah, but the other the other cool thing for nerds is that now of course they make
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.680]   as Alex said, they make a whole different line of these things. And as you can imagine, it
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:42.720]   costs a lot of money to like make different SKUs for every single one or different boards for
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:48.320]   every single one. So there's actually a hack. There's instructions online that if you if you short
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:53.520]   a couple of jumpers on the on the board, you can turn like the you can turn like the Tetris one
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.240]   into like the Galaxian one. No, they're actually there are actually three games on some of them.
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:02.960]   And you can actually put a little ABC switch. Obviously, if I were just interested in playing
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:06.960]   the games, I would just like buy the game itself. But it's kind of fun that you can actually hack
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:13.040]   these things. There's an Oregon, Oregon Trail version of this. All I'm saying is that it's I love it.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.680]   It's simple. It's easy to just toss in your pocket. Again, for that little bit of distraction
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.160]   you need, you just want that meditative playing it all the playing an old game. But but isn't it a
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:28.480]   sad commentary that the only way to get the classic we were talking about like classic Apple two games,
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.640]   I give you money for the game. You sell me the game. I own the game. It is the classic game. I don't
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:40.000]   have to watch any ads or any other kind of mess. I have to actually buy like a special little
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.280]   gamepad sort of thing. That's it's lovely. I love it. It's only they're only like 20 bucks each.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:48.720]   And some of them have more than one game on it. They have one version that has just like a whole
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:55.600]   bunch of classic like Atari 2600 games on it. I'm I believe I will own probably I did I did order
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.360]   the dig dug version is on the way because I think that will also translate very, very well.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.840]   Yeah, it's it's there's there's something I don't know if it's nostalgia or just the idea that
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.640]   I associate that with peace meditation. There's no pressure. I don't I don't have to get I don't
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:16.560]   have to get emotionally connected to these really beautifully animated 120 frame per second HDR
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:23.600]   4k characters. It's the the Pac-Man dude is just a Pac-Man dude. If he dies, he dies. He's just a
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:28.240]   cartoon character. I don't I don't have any emotional connection to them nor have I spent like but
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.520]   I just spent like four weeks like leveling this character up and now you just got you got blown
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:40.320]   up in a powder keg explosion that stinks. So definitely for for for dads grads makes a lovely
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:45.680]   stocking stuffer. I would say if I were not beneath like doing holiday gift guys, I can't decide whether
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:51.280]   I could play asteroids on it or not like it's a too small to play asteroids. I'm I that would be
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:56.320]   one of the last ones I've got. Ironically, the original resolution, but it's just probably what
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:02.800]   is very small. But it's it's it's a lot even even Pac-Man is like you're it's you're you're playing
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:09.200]   based on faith a lot. Yeah, look at that. But still, 20 bucks. The original asteroids that is it.
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.200]   I played that game that Victor graphics game. Wow. Wow.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:24.160]   Super. So actually super impulse.com. The micro arcade brand for if you want to look,
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:30.640]   they also has little tiny versions of other games. This is for people who are really like
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.720]   got small fingers, I guess. There's there's another there's another company that's not
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.840]   that's not on that sheet. They're actually making scaled down version of the actual arcade cabinets.
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:45.040]   Yes, like they're they're kind of like tiny arcade. This is the same site. Super impulse. You
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:48.640]   mean like these? No, they're even better. I'll try to I'll try to find it.
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:54.080]   By the end show, but but they're they're amazing because they are the original.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:58.160]   They are the original ROMs. They every control that you would have on the arcade they're built
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:02.800]   to scale again. They're not like scaled proportions so that they make it very, very easy to play
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:08.240]   in a countertop. They even remember like the classic like brown like change machine that you get.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.480]   Yeah, you can find a car. Oh, you have a version of that. They have a very that was a lorry
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:17.680]   gill pick. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And it actually asked us. Yes. Yes. It's actually a charger. It's a
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:25.360]   phone charger. Oh my god. Oh my god. There is a big market for for nostalgic nerds, obviously.
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:30.800]   Well yours. We're sick. We're sick. We're having to sit through ads. We just want to play dragons
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:35.280]   later for God's sake. All right, as long as we're talking nostalgia, I'm going to mention Roberto.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:40.400]   He's got he's in our chatroom right now. Throw boy. We've talked about his stuff before. He's got
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:47.520]   a new Kickstarter. This is the iconic pillow collection too. And if you're a Mac lover,
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.320]   you will love this throw boy always does these great. We have many, many throw boy pillows.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:14:01.440]   Now you can get a cheese grater Mac. You can get a Lisa. You can get the color of Mac laptops.
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:06.400]   There's Roberto. He does these himself. He's really kind of a neat guy. He's already
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:15.440]   they posted and already got to a full the full commitment. But I think you might want to get in
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:20.960]   there. There's 17 days left. Kickstarter just search for iconic pillow collection too.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:25.680]   And what's that? You know what all of Apple's next designs are going to look like. Yes.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:31.600]   You Mac book air there on the left. Yeah. He doesn't. Of course he can't say any trademark.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.040]   There's no apples on him. But that's the 1983 pillow, the 1999 pillow. The
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:45.840]   cube is the 2000 pillow. The iconic lamp. I Mac 2002 and then the cheese grater 2003.
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:54.160]   That's fun to sit on. A Lisa. Nice job, Roberto. Good job.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:01.920]   Your pick of the week, Mr. Renee Richie. So my pick of the week is hashtag. Let's do the air
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:08.560]   hashtag air hashtag team sees, which is a creator initiative. It's organized by Jimmy Donaldson,
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:14.560]   Mr. Beast and Mark Rober for Monasta and Apple engineer. And it's designed to sort of raise
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:19.440]   awareness, but also raise funding for getting trash out of the ocean. And they like to keep
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:25.440]   things simple. So last time it was $1 for one tree planted. And this time it's $1 for one
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.920]   pound of trash being taken out of the oceans and the rivers. And I got to be involved in some of
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:33.680]   the early discussions about this and I got to hear how they're doing it. And they really went
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.080]   above and beyond to make sure all the money is going exactly where it's supposed to be.
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:43.440]   It's audited. It's like the UN involved. It's a tremendous undertaking. And they got hundreds,
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.880]   you know, thousands of creators to all post videos on this all the same time, sort of get things
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.520]   going ended up on Jimmy Kimmel talking about it, which was really neat to see, you know, the YouTube
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:58.000]   taking over a little bit of traditional media. But it got to 10 million. They want to raise 30
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.440]   million to get 30 million pounds of trash out of the out of our water systems. And we got to 10
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.880]   million really quickly. Now we're working our way towards 15 million, 13 million says there are
[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:16.000]   13 million, 891,000 already. But you know, every dollar helps every little bit helps every just
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.920]   sharing it helps with people. If you don't have any money to to devote to this right now,
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.560]   just sharing helping with the awareness is fantastic. I put up a video about it. Like I said, where I
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.760]   talk about apples initiatives and reducing plastic, like the iPhone 13, the antenna bands are made
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:36.240]   out of up cycled plastic bottles. And they've been replacing plastic product wraps with paper,
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:41.120]   ethically sourced paper product wraps. And Jimmy, Mr. Beast was kind enough to do the intro to my
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:47.040]   video. So it's fun just seeing him sort of scrutinize me a demand to know what Apple's doing to help
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:53.520]   reduce plastics in the ocean. So it's a terrific project. It's great to see all the creators involved.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:58.480]   And it's a really, really good cause because it's it's devastating to marine life, but also
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:04.000]   to human life. So the more we can do the better. It's just hashtag team sees on social or team sees
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.960]   that work on the web. Nice. Or see Renee's video at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. And you can watch
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:18.240]   Mr. Beast on the beach. Very nice, very nice. I'm glad you ended on a high note. That's good.
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:25.040]   Thank you, Renee. We do. Thank you all three of you. YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. That's
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:33.600]   Renee's site. Lots of good videos that new video talking with the the chip designers
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:39.600]   is a must watch. Yeah, I'll be watching that the minute I get home. His review of the M1 Max.
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:48.160]   He got his all the way in Canada. I don't know how. I'm so happy for you. Quad major leak reactions.
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:53.040]   But I think the Silicon VP interview, that's going to be the one I definitely. Yeah, Tim Mallett,
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:57.680]   who's vice president of platform technologies, which just means he runs Apple Silicon. He's been
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.000]   there since the original iPhone, the very first iPhone. So he's been leading Apple's chips at
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.120]   technology since then. And Tom Boger, vice president of Mac and iPad marketing, who's
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.520]   literally been there almost three decades now. And the thing that I liked the most was you could
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.120]   hear the passion in their voice for the Macs, because people still have lingering questions
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:19.360]   about that. But once you watch this video, the amount that I need someone to look at me the way
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:25.120]   Tom looks at the Mac and my life will be fulfilled. Nice. Nice. It's nice to know the Mac still gets
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.680]   from love. YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. Andy, when are you going to be on WGBH next?
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:38.720]   Friday at 1230, you can watch it. Listen to it live or later at wgphnews.org. Very nice.
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:46.240]   And I hope you'll explain Zeno's paradox this Thursday. It'll be fascinating. I can only come
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:55.600]   halfway towards the explanation. A little geek joke in there. Zing, zing, not XKCD, but
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:03.120]   okay. And of course, Alex, Lindsey, Office Hours. Global, what's the latest at Office Hours?
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.880]   We spent an hour today talking about game staging, which was really good. I
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:14.880]   and even liked it. He was tweeted. I saw hands tweet. Yeah. So we just like an hour of really,
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.520]   really smart audio folks just talking about game staging. Tomorrow's game staging. Do I
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:24.880]   have to watch the video to find out? Well, you've got a bunch of audio devices in a chain. So you've
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.560]   got your mic going into a preamp and then it goes to a mixer, then it goes to something else.
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.160]   You got to get all those gains the same or you're going to end up with distortion and
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:37.280]   everything else. One's too low or the other one's too high. So how do you organize those and why?
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:46.400]   Why is that important? So we had that discussion. Tomorrow I figured out, I figured we were working
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:49.920]   in a labs, you know, after hours, we have these labs where we all just kind of get together for
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:58.720]   an hour and learn something together. And so we figured out last week how to build a AV sync,
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:04.240]   you know, to get audio and video to sync up how to calculate that with just colors on a screen
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:09.600]   and audio. But like we built a notal, like a notal structure inside of Isadora to figure that
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:14.080]   out. Like so it'll just watch it and say, Oh, you're a hundred and sixty three milliseconds off.
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.720]   And that costs like $10,000 normally. So we figured out how to do it. We are on
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:25.200]   we're on NPR today on here and here and now. Oh, nice. If you do us, I think I tweeted it out,
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:28.560]   but if you do it, it's called the Belfast method. It's one of the things that the folks are doing.
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:35.200]   So they just did a story about it in NPR and then making savory pancakes this Saturday with
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:40.400]   with a Daimenta. And so I have been making I made that we had spicy,
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:47.360]   we had spicy eggs, scrambled eggs last week. And I've had them every day since because now I'm
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:50.640]   good at it. Like I've gotten good at it. I'm like, Oh, I like this. I like that. And so
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:55.280]   but what you really get to see is also us experimenting with this idea that we could learn
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:00.240]   together. You know, the cooking is just the, you know, just one context. I mean, this could be
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:04.960]   anything, you know, woodturning or, or, you know, working on cars or whatever. And so you could,
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.960]   you could, so we're experimenting with what do you need to do to make that actually work.
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:13.440]   Because it's much harder than making a TV show because you actually has to work for everyone.
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:17.360]   So it's a work experiment with that on Saturdays. And you may have mentioned this last week,
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:20.560]   but there was a great article about you in the PC magazine, John Kalish.
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:23.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Really good. Really good.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:30.880]   Yeah. He did such a great job. Like this is actually a great overview of.
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:33.360]   Picture of you. Look at that big picture. My sister took that.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:41.440]   Yeah. So the, but the, he did a really, really great job of, he interviewed a ton of people
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:44.960]   throughout the, you know, he talked to me for a little while and then, you know, you just forget
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:51.200]   what like, you know, I'm so used to like someone just calls me, asks me a couple questions and
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:55.200]   writes a big article and you forget like there's people out there that will like spend. Great.
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:58.560]   Yeah. He spent, he spent like a month and a half or two months working on that article,
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:02.000]   interviewing people all over office hours and then coming up with that article.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.600]   And it's good. He is really good and glad to see you getting the coverage you deserve for
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:13.920]   office hours. Find out more at office hours. Global. We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday.
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:17.280]   Thank you. Who did the show last week? Did Micah host it last week? Thank you.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:19.760]   Yeah. Great job. Great job. Hosting. I really appreciate it.
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:27.840]   I am back though and you can watch us do the show as always on our live stream, which is live.twit.tv.
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:32.560]   You could choose audio or video if you're watching live. You might want to chat with us live at
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:38.640]   irc.twit.tv or in our discord, you know, the discord is a great place to hang out.
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:47.120]   Morning, noon and night, the home of the animated GIF apparently, we have discord channels for
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:55.600]   every show plus all the geeky topics you might be interested in. And if you would like, add free
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:01.520]   versions of all of our shows, access to the discord server and a special to it plus feed with
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:06.640]   content that you don't get in the podcast. Seven bucks a month. It's a good deal. It supports us.
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:12.160]   We really appreciate it. All you have to do is go to twit.tv/club-twit for more information.
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:17.280]   You can also buy individual shows ad free on iTunes. The audio versions of shows are available
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:21.680]   for $2.99 a month. So if you just want one show, that might be the more economical way to do it.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:27.280]   Although I happen to like the discord channel. I think it's worth seven bucks all by itself.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:34.960]   You can also get shows on demand from us at twit.tv in this case, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:40.080]   Every show has its own YouTube channel. So you can watch there if you want. Probably the easiest
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:46.880]   thing to do is get a podcast player and subscribe. And if your podcast client happens to offer
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:52.720]   reviews, please leave us a five star review. Let the world know about Mac break weekly.
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:57.760]   That's it for this show. Thank you for joining us now. I'm sad to say it's time
