[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   MacBreak Weekly, episode 50, halfway through our
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Century Mark, and joining us 50 panelists, one for each
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   episode.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   It's going to be a big show.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Feels like it.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We got a big panel starting with from applephoneshow.com,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   the lovely Scott Bourne.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Hello, Scott.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The lovely Scott Bourne.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's about the first time in 40 years somebody's
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   referred to me as lovely.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It's all that time you're spending on your new bike.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   That's it.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's got a new motorcycle on the way.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Actually, it hasn't been delivered yet.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's being built.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I had to pay for it in advance, but yes, it's very nice.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Once you give us the money, we'll buy the parts and assemble it.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yeah, that seems fair.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's a victory vision.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   VictoryVision.com.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You look like a good bike.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   No, no, no.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   The big cruiser.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And that voice is Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hello, Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Hello.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hello.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You have your muff on?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   No, I don't have a muff on.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Doesn't he sound muffled?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Do you have any compression on?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   No, I don't have any compression on.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hold on.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   How's that?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Is that better?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   No, but that's okay.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Alex is, of course, from pixelcore.tv and pixelcore, which is the home of many fine video podcasts,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   including the lovely Mac Break.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Parent podcast to this tiny little audio thing.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Flying.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Also here from New York City, Mr. Brett Larson.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello, Brett.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hey, hey.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Tech reporter for Fox 5.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And environmental reporter.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Very exciting.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   If you have any questions about garbage.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yes, recycle.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Remember kids, recycle.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Reuse, recycle.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Free purpose.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And it's all about compact fluorescent lighting.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Finally, if you like hot dogs, you're going to love Merlin Man.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   How are you?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, mylin, oh, I, I.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Listen, Brett, what should I do?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Should I be repurposing or reusing?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Is there one better than the other?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, you should always reuse when possible, but you should always recycle.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And here in the city of New York, it's the law.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You have to recycle.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Buildings get fined if they throw out recyclable.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I have to find a way to repurpose our podcasts.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I've repurposed my career for five years ago.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yeah, that's worked for me as well.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm basically saying the same things over and over again.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Nothing new.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Well, Apple released its quarterly results.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.280]   Actually, it's an interesting story because the day before AT&T announced that, well, we
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.400]   only sold 146-- I'm sorry, we only activated-- and this is important distinction.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.080]   We only activated 146,000 iPhones in the first weekend.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.440]   And that caused a sudden precipitous drop in the stock price, costing Scott Born several
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.000]   million dollars.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   No, it was only-- it was only-- what it was-- it wasn't--
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   6.1%.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, that's--
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He drops that much on the pack man each week.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   6.1% is a lot.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It was.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It precipitated my immediate buy order for more stock.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, he just took that as an opportunity.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.760]   And, you know, it's really interesting because it's interesting how much the stock market is
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.000]   influenced by expectations.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That's crazy, isn't it?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.600]   So 146,000 in one weekend, a lot of phones by any reckoning.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.840]   5,000 activations per hour.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.640]   I mean, that's more than AT&T's ever had before.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.560]   Well, and obviously they couldn't handle it.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   It was so many.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.280]   And the analysts before the sale had predicted 100,000 would be a success.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.040]   So the analysts themselves said 100,000.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360]   It was just after the superheated lines and everything people thought that would be a
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   quarter of a million.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   It turned out that it was.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   It was 270,000.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   Okay, okay, yeah.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.840]   Well, that's part two.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.440]   So anyway, so AT&T kind of threw cold water on it.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.280]   So we only activate 146,000.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.000]   And by the way, front page on the Chronicle, iPhone sales disappoint.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And then you're right.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.360]   I mean, unbelievable how the press dealt with this.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.240]   I mean, they really-- it's clear.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   And this always happens, whether it's Paris Hilton or the iPhone.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240]   The press--
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   They chop and they chop you down.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.600]   They love building them up.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.000]   They love overhyping it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760]   And we're not innocent of that.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.280]   And then, boom, cut the legs out right out from under them as soon as they get too uppity.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.160]   So it turns out that-- and even in the Chronicle's own reporting, once you finally got to the
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.840]   business section, said, well, remember that there were activation issues.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.280]   Many phones were purchased for gifts or for later use and may not have been activated that
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   first week.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.520]   And that was the sales that was just activations.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.920]   And then today, Apple on its conference call for its quarterly earnings.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   And we've scheduled-- we've cleverly scheduled our podcast for one hour after that conference
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.040]   call, said, well, we sold $20,000 in the first 30 hours.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.880]   That's pretty good.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.240]   That is really good for us.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.880]   I mean, for a cell phone?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   Because that's what it is.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.400]   An expensive cell phone.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   Very expensive, yes.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   So I'm just wondering how many months it took Microsoft to sell 230,000 zoons.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   I guess my real question-- and really--
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   Have they yet?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.160]   They claim that at the end of this month or end of June, they had sold a million, they
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   claim.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.040]   And I should qualify how many zoons they've sold to non-Microsoft employees.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   Yeah, really.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.640]   With a gun held to their head.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.600]   The truth is I think the real test of the iPhone is not the first weekend, but subsequent
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.120]   weeks and months.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.440]   And I wonder what we don't know is how they-- are you probably on the call?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   Were you?
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   Scott, I imagine you were sitting--
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.960]   You know, I was just tearing my hair out because I couldn't get in.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.280]   It was no doubt a very interesting call to a lot of people because normally I have no
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.520]   problem getting in.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.640]   I could not get in.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.840]   I tried getting in online.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.640]   I tried getting in on the actual phone call, tried getting in through my broker.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Shut down.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640]   Wow.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.280]   Well, that must have frustrated you.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380]   I was going nuts.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.920]   What they didn't say, they said-- and this may be-- I don't know if you want to read tea
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.760]   leaves-- it may be an indication of softness and subsequent sales.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.160]   They did talk about 270,000 phones in the first 30 hours, but they didn't give any other--
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.440]   as far as I could tell-- sales numbers.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.920]   They merely said we're still on track for a goal of 10 million phones in calendar 2008.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   You won't hear any more numbers out of them at all until next quarter.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.560]   I'm surprised they said numbers at all.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.800]   I guess they wanted to respond to that AT&T figure.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.840]   Yeah, they had to quote dollars.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.680]   They didn't have to quote units.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.160]   So that's the part that's interesting to me.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.720]   But if you look at the-- I mean, obviously, the iPhone's getting all the attention, but
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   hello.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   Big, big.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.440]   This is the biggest June in Apple's history, 5.41 billion in net quarterly profit, 92 cents
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.120]   per diluted share is way over the 75 cent mark that people were looking for.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   I mean, this is--
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   This is--
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.240]   Sure, the stock price tomorrow will go right back to where it was and then some.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.760]   And Scott Borne will once again be a paper billionaire.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.480]   Dollar cost averaging paper.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   Dollar cost averaging.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   $818 million in profit.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   That's fantastic.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.120]   Yeah, they did.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.840]   What's the-- there's no-- anyone who tries to make this quarter to Apple look anything
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.680]   other than great, well, we know where they're coming from.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:12.120]   And interestingly, on Mac sales, 1.7 million Macs, that's 33% growth over this quarter
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   a year ago and exceeding the company's previous record by 150,000, 9.8 million iPods in the
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.360]   quarter, 21% growth.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.320]   So big sales of Macs, big sales of iPods, and then you just add the iPhone and it's
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   gravy.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.760]   Well, I find it very interesting that we hear a lot about people saying, well, Apple's
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.280]   no longer a computer company when they're selling more computers than they ever have
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   in their history.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.680]   Well, I'm relieved because I was worried that Apple might start thinking of itself as
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.040]   an iPhone and iPod company.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.900]   So I'm glad to hear that the Macs are still selling.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.080]   There is one little teeny bit of bad news.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.600]   You really got to look deep to see it.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:59.880]   And that is the-- the number of iPods sold is really high, but the profit on the iPods,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.720]   even though they sold more, actually went down.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.920]   So their margin is slimming, but that's--
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Yeah, the iPod--
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.640]   I thought it was a 50% markup on the iPhone.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   Not on the iPhone, the iPod.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   That makes sense.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.200]   I mean, the prices have been dropping on the iPod.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.040]   So they actually sold more, but they made less.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.560]   So that will be a trend that people will want to take a look at because obviously the
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.640]   iPod's a big factor still in Apple's future.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.280]   They did not book any earnings from AT&T, but they plan to start doing that in future
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.280]   quarters.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.480]   So that's going to even make more profit.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.680]   Because once again, this is a historic deal.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.920]   They're actually getting paid a share of the cellular revenue.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.000]   As far as we know, that's never been done before.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   Are they getting paid as part of the subscription?
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   Subscription.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   Subscription.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.120]   They get all the revenue from the hardware, which, as Brett said, is at least 50%.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   And they get subscription.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.720]   So they're-- yeah, you know, you don't see Sony Ericsson making a deal like that.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   That's pretty remarkable.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   It's insane.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.440]   I have to say, from a business point of view, it makes sense.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.120]   I'm sad that Apple decided to, you know, sell to this kind of closed environment and
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.240]   kind of become part of this industry that is so loathsome, this wireless phone industry.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.600]   But I guess, you know, hey, they're a business and they're going to do what's going to make
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   them the most money.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   But I just wish they--
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   I think it's also a start.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   You know, I mean, Apple broke the deal.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   But they made the deal.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.920]   I mean, I don't-- I want you to do the deal with the devil where you're now going to make
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   an open phone.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   I don't know.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.040]   But if you did open the phone, Leo, you get to work with people like, what, T-Mobile?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.400]   No, I think what they should do is make a device.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   I mean, Nokia does this.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   A lot of companies do this.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.080]   Make a device that's open, unlocked, you know.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.400]   And maybe work with companies like Google.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.160]   I mean, with Google making noises about buying spectrum in the 700 megahertz range, I think
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.560]   they may end up being a very potent wireless force.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.960]   But if you made an iPhone that supported SIP over Wi-Fi and said, screw the cell companies,
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.120]   I think that that option's still open for Apple.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   There's no--
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.840]   --an absolute device that they can do anything they want.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.640]   So if they decide to offer VoIP over an iPhone without the cellular capability, they're totally
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.200]   able to do that, you know.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.840]   So I don't-- I think that this is what they need to do now.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.000]   But I think-- I don't know that the technology for that is really where it needs to be for
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   an average.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, this is very speculative.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.320]   If you're right, I mean, it's way off.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   But you know, there's like--
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   Not this over--
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   --years down the road.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.320]   There is an open device, the open moku.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.120]   Everybody says, every time we talk about the iPhone, why don't you ever mention the
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   open moku?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.720]   There, I've said it, open moku.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.040]   Now, wait, what language is that?
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.360]   I was going to say, is it like a treasure chest opening somewhere?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   The open source community has a terrible track record with hardware.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.920]   I remember they tried to make a game machine.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.560]   I mean, it's not-- but they are making these cell phones.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.000]   You can buy them now as a developer.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.440]   Perhaps we'll be able to buy them in the fall or later as consumers.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   They're SIP phones.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   They're exactly what I would love to see.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   Apple do.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   They have a touch screen.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.840]   They have some Apple-like capabilities.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   But anyway, you know, and there are other companies watching what Apple's doing, the
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.400]   Prada, the LG Prada.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.160]   HTC has a touch screen that looks a lot like an iPhone.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.720]   I don't think Apple will have a monopoly in this market.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   But as--
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.160]   Yeah, I'm curious to see CES in '08 and see what the cell phone companies come back to
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.240]   the table with after seeing the iPhone.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   And how--
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.400]   I'm curious to see if anything.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.800]   I'm curious to see if anybody will go to CES given what happened last year.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   That's true.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.120]   Apple won't be there.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.680]   Mac business represents 60% of quarterly revenue.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.560]   That's a growth of one-third.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.480]   Mac Notebook's up 42% over this time last year.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   That's great news.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   Wow.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.440]   It's clearly a halo effect from the iPod and maybe even from the iPhone.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:58.040]   We all worried aloud when we heard about the delay of OS X about-- as some people would
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.440]   put it, whether Apple can walk and shoot gum at the same time.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.160]   Hearing what you hear and knowing about the success of these, do any of you have a different
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.720]   point of view now about Apple in terms of resources for being able to put what they
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.520]   need, where it needs to be going forward?
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   I'm still worried.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.600]   I think that's when we talked about this last week that's the problem Google poses is
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.720]   that Google sucks up all the time.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   Right.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Well, I think that--
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.160]   I'm pretty happy with the operating system that I have now, 10.4.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   That's true.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   We should say that.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   Just because you won't let them--
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.560]   So when they said that they'd delay in it, moving to a new operating system generally
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.440]   is a fairly traumatic event in my life when I have to.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.560]   It's a week of chaos generally.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   And so if they released it right now, I probably wouldn't upgrade until October anyway because
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.920]   I don't have a break time where I can have computers not working.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.400]   And just working out all the issues with the new apps and where the new apps get broken.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   And there's all this slow cascade.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.280]   And the operating system I have now works very, very well.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.080]   There's little bugs here and there.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.520]   But I'm quite happy with it.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.040]   And a lot of the new features, I have to admit some of them I feel like I'm just going
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.240]   to have to use before I really get my head around them, the time machine and all these
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   extra little features.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.800]   And there's a couple of them that I'm excited about.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.640]   But a lot of them, I'm just kind of like, oh, it'll be one of those Apple things where
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.600]   I'll be excited once I'm using them.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.920]   But right now when I look at them, I'm like, it's not like every day I wish I had time
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   machine.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.720]   If you're one of the people who, and I think Apple almost really said as much that they
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.360]   were moving resources around, if you were one of the folks who made that decision at
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.840]   that time, you've got to be breathing a sigh of relief that things seem to be turning out
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   well after that.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.960]   I mean, I know OS or 10.5 is not out yet, but still, just being sure.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.520]   Which is really surprising because I remember they did the Dog and Pony show on that a year
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.040]   ago, dragged us all out.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.840]   And so you're looking at it, check it out.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.200]   It's working so great.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   And now it's really.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.640]   Yeah, that was one of the, one of the big disappointments, Brett, at, I think at the
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.520]   WWDC was just that so much of it was, you know, kind of leopard 2.0, you know, they'd
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.520]   already kind of heard.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.760]   You said it was not the only one who sat through the WWDC in '06 and thought it was
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   boring.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.560]   Maybe that's just your one.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.520]   I think I don't even remember it.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   That's why.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.080]   I don't remember what it was.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:27.440]   It just, they just went on and on about some very benign features and in the 10.5 and it's
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.360]   just like, well, that was wasted time.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.680]   Well, if anything was boring, it was the last one because it was a repeat of the 1006.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.040]   Well, wasn't the last WWDC, that's when they really, they announced all the intel.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.960]   I mean, a lot of the, they announced that they were moving to all the stuff didn't.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   No, that was that.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.880]   Well, that was when they, that wasn't when they announced the chief of the Mac Pro.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   Right.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.960]   Anyway, well, maybe I'm just bitter because I cover consumer technology and there was no
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.840]   consumer announcements at that.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.920]   Hey, let's, that's WWDC.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   You have to go to Macworld for a consumer.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.840]   You know, Apple definitely has gotten into a pattern.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.840]   It's really funny.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.240]   You look at a, you know, we expect to see stuff.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.120]   If they're going to release something related to visual effects, it'll be Sunday before
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Seagrap.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.040]   If they're going to release something for video, it'll be the Sunday before NAB.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.560]   Consumer electronics are going to come out in Macworld and, you know, programmer or slash
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.880]   operating systems are going to be talked about at WWDC.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   And it's, it's kind of a pattern now.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.680]   And we literally are developing, we develop plugins for Final Cut Pro Studio and we literally
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.360]   develop around the Apple, you know, release schedule.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.680]   And so it's gotten to a kind of very regular pattern, which is, you know, very good for
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   us.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   I'm hoping to keep it that way.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   Right.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   It's good for recommending when people should buy hardware too.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.640]   What do we want to see in Macworld 2008?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.080]   And what do you predict will be the big announcements of 2000 January, only, only six months away
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   now?
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.880]   I got a, I got a feeling.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   I got a feeling.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   A yellow iPad.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   No, no, no.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   Actually, I have an update on that.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.080]   No, I, I really do hope that there's going to be a small laptop.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.160]   I got, I got a feeling about this.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.280]   I was going to say the same thing.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's, it's got to happen.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.480]   You want it or because they're going to do it?
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.880]   Oh, well, you know, okay.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.120]   So, so I'm, I don't know.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.640]   I don't follow this stuff.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.600]   All I do is just kind of salivate over it.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Like, like any fanboy.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.640]   That's pretty much how we all do it.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:30.240]   I think it'll be really interesting to say, okay, MacBook Pros are going to be, you know,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.720]   these are, these are our workhorse machines.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.040]   We're not going to screw around with those.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.640]   But what could we do in the Mac Pro area?
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.080]   Like, if we were going to be something like, I don't know, like there's these room in
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.080]   the Mac Pro area.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   What did I say?
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   Mac Pro.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   That's not particularly portable.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   I meant to say MacBook.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   I'd love a portable Mac Pro.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   A portable Mac Pro would be sweet.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   A portable Mac Pro.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.600]   I heard there's one coming out.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.320]   It's going to be in a yellow submarine case.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   It's going to have a form.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.680]   It's going to have a tiny screen with pinch.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.480]   It'll be 30 pounds though.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   It'll be a little suitcase.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480]   Yes.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   And wheels.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.480]   And wheels.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480]   I want one.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   No, you're still here.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   Russia laptop, like, like, is on to you.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.920]   You're still looking for a -- you're still looking for a lightweight 2-pound, 3-pound.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.960]   I'm just saying, okay, so all I'm trying to say is I would not diddle around too much
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.920]   with the MacBook Pros because I think those need to be really serious honking machines.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.840]   But if you say, okay, well, I'm willing, I want to pay a little bit less, but I really,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.920]   you know, I was like, I still see these PCs ever since I saw the VIO.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   I still feel like this is where PCs are eating our lunch.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.960]   And even if you did something like take out the optical drive and I don't know how that
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   would work.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   I don't think you need to.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.800]   I don't think -- I think you're seeing small PCs.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.720]   This is my prediction.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.920]   My prediction is that it's going to be a sub the size it is now.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.880]   I don't know if it's going to be these kind of, like, whatever 9-inch monitors that they've
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   been talking about, but --
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.720]   No, I bet you 13-inch widescreen.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.120]   A half-inch thick, 10-pound -- no, 2-pounds.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   I say 10, 2-pounds.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   It's got wheels.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   2-1/2 pounds.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   10-pound.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   10-pounds.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.160]   And it's got a little head -- a little cup for your head, so you can carry it on your
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   head.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.320]   And a satellite dish pops out of the top.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:18.360]   I think they're going to move to announce, at least announce, more flash-based laptops.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.040]   That's the coming thing.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.440]   Everybody says the coming thing.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.160]   But there are, I think, technical issues.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.320]   Well, the biggest thing that they've already bought up most of the flash memory in the world.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.480]   Yeah, 25% of all the flash memory goes to Apple, but that's for existing products.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.920]   That's for stuff they already make.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.320]   So I don't know what it will -- could they corner the flash market entirely?
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   I could.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:46.600]   I also see the -- finally, the cinema display with the iSci camera and the new iMac with
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.160]   aluminum cases.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.600]   Those are my January predictors.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   That would be cool.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.440]   That'd be a very pretty iMac.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.480]   You think at this point they'll hold off on any of those announcements until January?
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   Nothing for Christmas.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.520]   I think they'll do some more iPod stuff for Christmas.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   I think there's more iPods for Christmas, I think.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.440]   Because the iPod is kind of lined up for an update.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   We haven't got enough.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.080]   The question is, is there -- everyone thinks it's going to happen in August 7th or something
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   like that.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   I mean, that's the rumor.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   Why August 7th?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   Is there a magical -- oh, no.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.560]   Seventh is because it's in the rumor mill.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.560]   I had to repeat it.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.560]   707.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   I read it on the net.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.560]   It was true.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   80707.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.840]   We'll see how that goes.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.920]   I think that also we're going to sometime next year.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.640]   I don't know if it's going to be from Macworld because Macworld tends to be much more of a
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.000]   consumer-oriented thing.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.080]   Intel now is releasing -- or they're working on -- they've announced that they're going
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.040]   to release the 16-prock 4-core 4-processor systems.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.120]   I think the Mac Pro's will most likely keep on beefing up.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.920]   Any of you have an octo?
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.920]   No.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   You don't even have an octo pixel core.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   No.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.640]   We -- right now, because of what most of our production right now is really, really heavy
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.960]   video at the moment.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.200]   We haven't had the need to have quite that much processing power for the video stuff.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   So we've done --
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   So we could use it, though.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.080]   You could double your compression speeds.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.600]   For us, you know, for us, the compression isn't as much as dealing with HD frames.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.320]   And so that's mostly drive issues, drive and bandwidth issues.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   Right.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.480]   So we're mostly dealing with raids, you know, really fast raids.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.960]   That's kind of been my contention all along is that you could put as many processors as
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.200]   you want, but if you're IO-constrained, it doesn't really matter.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.040]   And a lot of what I want to do is IO-constrained when you get to that point.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.200]   My opinion is the current octos, I think, are -- and I haven't done a lot of the testing,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.920]   but this is -- they didn't really upgrade the buses.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   Right.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   So there's --
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   So this --
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.120]   And so the -- what you have is the standard 4-Prock one that they just put another card
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.640]   in that's the 8-Prock.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.960]   So my concern is I really am waiting for another machine that's built for the 8-Prock, not
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.200]   just with 8-Prock stuck into it.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   So I'm trying to hold off.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.280]   And because it's just the 4-Prock with an 8-Prock card, there's nothing special about it.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.640]   And I'm waiting for faster buses and all that stuff soon.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.360]   Apple -- among other things Apple announced in its profit announcement, they did say they
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.760]   expect to sell 1 million iPhones by September 29th.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.200]   So that they're on track to do that.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   That's pretty good.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.360]   I'm guessing that they probably have sold half a million by now.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.640]   If they sold 270,000 in the first two days, and then the news came out that most of people
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.680]   were happy and everything else, I mean, there's still a lot of people now buying them.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.120]   They kind of waited to see which way it went.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.760]   There's just no amount of pressure it took by it.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   Once your friends have them and you see how cool it is, I think it's going to be a second
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   wave of buyers.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.480]   I've learned about 5 people in the Apple store Saturday in downtown San Francisco trying
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.000]   them to touch one.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.200]   Every time I go in the 5th Avenue store here, you can't get to them.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   5th Avenue store, by the way, is now selling 5 Macs.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   What is it?
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   5 Macs an hour?
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Oh my God.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.760]   That doesn't seem like that many, but I guess it is.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.320]   Every 12 minutes another Mac, they should ring a bell.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.200]   It's like an angel getting his wings.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.400]   Every time a bell rings, an artist gets their MacBook Pro.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.160]   It doesn't really make a ring.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.760]   You have a different tone for each computer ding.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.920]   Have you guys noticed at the Apple store, the way they've configured the iPhone accessories
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.360]   is right below the iPhone display.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.400]   And therefore, there's always somebody standing in front of the accessories.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   And you can't see them.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   That's annoying.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   What was that?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Yes, I noticed that today.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   Maybe that's because the accessories are so crappy.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   Well, that's true.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   They don't want you to see the exact.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   They're not.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.120]   I'm still waiting for the best case.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.640]   What's the best case?
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.240]   I don't know, but I can tell you that the Bluetooth.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.680]   My head's not looking pretty good.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   Oh, did you get it?
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.680]   The apples came out?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   Yeah, got it yesterday.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   What do you think?
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   Or before yesterday?
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   All right.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.080]   Is it better than the Moby?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   What is it?
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   The jawbone?
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   The jawbone?
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   Okay.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   Here's my take on it.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.040]   It doesn't sound as good to the person on the other end of the line as the jawbone,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.440]   but it's 10 times more comfortable.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.080]   That's important, frankly, because people wear that all day.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.640]   I can only wear the jawbone for about an hour.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.040]   Your jaw starts to hurt.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   It hurts bad.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   The jawbone has a little better range and it has better noise canceling.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.200]   The Apple product is much more comfortable, has less range, but sounds better than any
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.360]   other headset I've got.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.060]   The cool thing is the auto pairing.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.480]   That is cool.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.140]   You don't have to like, stand on your left.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.860]   - Really, it just sees an iPhone and says,
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.040]   would you like to join me?
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.060]   - You put the iPhone in, by the way,
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.060]   this is cool, you get two charging docks with the headset.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.480]   So this gives you some extra charging capacity
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.300]   for your iPhone. - It's a dock
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.460]   for both the iPhone and the headset.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.720]   - Yeah, so you set the headset and the dock,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.380]   you set the iPhone and the headset and the dock,
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.480]   and it goes, boop, we're paired.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.200]   - Wow, oh, they're paired just by being
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.100]   in the dock at the same time.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   - Just by being in the dock.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.900]   - Oh, that's a very good way to do it.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.740]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.460]   - Once again, this is where Apple really has succeeded
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.900]   with the iPhone is this seamless kind of works together
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.100]   with your Mac, your iTunes, your iPhone, your--
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.940]   - And it's really cool.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.660]   - Except the ICal colored calendars.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.060]   I have a beef with that.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.380]   - Wait a minute, what's that all about?
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.220]   I don't know what--
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.640]   - Well, listen, I've used ICal now,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.860]   pretty much since it came out,
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.980]   I have seven different calendars.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.820]   - Oh yeah, it doesn't use the colors.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   - Seven different colors.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.660]   - Yeah.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.580]   - And I was so excited to sync it with my iPhone
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.820]   'cause I thought finally--
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.580]   - It doesn't know about categories, you're right.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.700]   - Doesn't know about categories,
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.660]   it's one color on the iPhone.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.260]   It's like, come on guys, you should have--
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.580]   - No kidding.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.860]   - And moreover, if you have a red calendar,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.300]   we found in our troubleshooting that a lot of times
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.380]   it won't sync.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.740]   - Oh, it doesn't like red.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.580]   - It doesn't like red.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.420]   - It's like a pole.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.940]   - It's a shame 'cause that's my personal calendar
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.620]   and that's the one that has the most useless information.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.460]   - It's saying just 'cause a calendar's red,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.940]   it doesn't sync it.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.380]   - We had four or five users contacting it.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.300]   - No, I didn't know.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.140]   - And we probably--
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.980]   - That's a good card go cold.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.260]   - Are you sure about that?
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.660]   - It is absolutely true.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.620]   And maybe Alex can shed some light on this.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.500]   I was told that the same problem occurred
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.140]   with some video cards and different high-end video products
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.980]   where people had calendars with red colors
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.260]   they wouldn't work in various video editing.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.460]   I would try fixing the white--
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.100]   - I haven't seen that, but I really can't see that.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.180]   - That's so white balance is wrong.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.180]   - It's singing.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.780]   - I have a number of red calendars
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.820]   and it syncs with my red.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.460]   In fact, all of my podcasts are in red
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.740]   and it syncs with those.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.580]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.380]   This is what we found is cases.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.220]   So it could be coincidence. - That's so nice.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.820]   - It could have been something else, but anyway,
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.220]   real quick, back to the Bluetooth headset.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.260]   The one thing I wanna point out is that
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.260]   I did actually test the length of time it would work.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.340]   And I got, if they say 72 hours,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.780]   this without being used, just standby time.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.860]   I got 71 and a half hours.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.700]   - Oh, wow.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.700]   They were acting. - Wow.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.860]   That's about right.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.700]   It shouldn't.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.540]   That's three days.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.980]   I mean, that's not that much.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.820]   I have not been able to talk on it
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.500]   for five and a half hours straight
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.380]   because I just don't have that much to say to anybody,
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.020]   but that's what they claim it will last.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.860]   It is $10 more than a jawbone,
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.940]   but you get the charging dock with it and--
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.780]   - I like the dock.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.980]   That's a nice idea.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.380]   - And what's really cool is when you put
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.220]   a little headset in the thing,
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.940]   it shows up in a picture above the battery bar
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.340]   as a little picture of the headset being charged.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.540]   - Well, that's nice.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.380]   - That's nice.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.420]   - It's a, see, they thought about everything.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.460]   It's the cute details that Apple gets right.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.780]   - Yes, special.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   Yeah, you know, I'm still a mixed opinion.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.100]   I'll give you my objective opinion
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.620]   for the Apple Funk show when we do that.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.860]   - Thank you.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.620]   - I just wish they could,
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.140]   there's so many things they need to fix.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.420]   Even bugs, little bugs, buggy bugs.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.500]   I was listening to my iPod and it keeps crashing
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.900]   when I do other stuff.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.100]   - Mine does too.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.540]   - Yeah, it doesn't like it that you're busy.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.500]   It says no, listen to me.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.340]   - Yeah.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.140]   - It just, and sometimes mine, the iPod will just stop playing.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.340]   - Yeah, for no reason.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.820]   - I think I must be getting a call.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.140]   - No, I interpret that as a crash.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.740]   I mean, maybe it isn't crashing,
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.940]   but well, it must be because then I go back to it
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.900]   and it's jumped back to the last place I stopped it.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.380]   So it must have crashed.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.220]   - Not just a call.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.060]   - I'm just excited that it quiets itself
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.900]   and lets you in.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.740]   - That's nice.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.580]   - It does that nice, though.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.220]   - Yeah, or when an alarm goes off,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.620]   it ramps down and it ramps up.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.660]   - Actually, it doesn't ramp up.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.100]   It turns on, but it ramps down.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.340]   - I mean, are you guys having any issues
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.100]   where it's freezing, where you get a call?
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.420]   - It seems to be only once to me.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   - Yeah, I've had it four times in the last three days.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.900]   - I have that where I end a call
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.220]   and the call ends and it won't go back
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.820]   to what it was doing before.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.260]   - Well, I'm having it where the phone call comes in
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.420]   and I can't see it, but I can't.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.580]   I keep on hitting the screen and nothing taps on the screen.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.660]   - It happens to me once and that's very,
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.420]   that's really annoying.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.260]   - It's annoying.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.380]   - But now I do want to point out that we are grading,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.220]   we are not grading on the curve here
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.060]   because if you grade on the curve,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.740]   in other words, and compare it to every other cell phone made,
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.340]   these are the kinds of things, every other cell phone,
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.900]   this is standard and we kind of overlook it
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.060]   'cause all cell phones are terrible.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.460]   We're not grading the iPhone on a curve,
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.180]   we're actually putting it in the class of its own
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.020]   and saying, you know, this is, but in all honesty,
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.300]   I mean, these are the kinds of things
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.620]   I've had every phone I've ever had
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.900]   is locked up during a call at one point or another.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.740]   - Yeah, I mean, that's--
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.020]   - Every smartphone I've had, you know.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.060]   - Smart, kind of repeating what you're saying,
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.260]   but this is the ultimate first world problem.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.380]   I mean, which is, I mean, no, no, I'm not saying,
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.900]   don't complain, I'm quite the opposite.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.220]   I'm saying that, it's like the thing they say in sales
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.260]   where when people start asking what color comes in,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.660]   you know, you've closed the deal.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.540]   And I think when A, when you've got people
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.660]   who are this emotionally engaged with your product,
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.620]   you have a good thing going on.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.300]   And second, yeah, I mean, people are,
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.020]   they were raising the bar with this.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.460]   This is from the beginning, everybody has understood
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.460]   that the expectations for this were gonna be very high.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.580]   And I think it's inevitable that there's,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.660]   after the initial, you know, high wears off
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.300]   and the distortion field starts to fade a little bit,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.380]   you're gonna come up with this stuff.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.220]   I mean, you know, I just looking at this from far,
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.540]   I don't see how you can not have red calendars
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.460]   and not have tasks.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.300]   I mean, stuff like that seems crazy to me.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.820]   - But that's a minor detail, really.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.140]   - But it's totally minor.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.860]   It's, I mean, in the long run.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.340]   Yeah, and it's such a flexible thing
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.180]   that there's so many different things that--
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.940]   - It's the same thing with to-do lists.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.540]   But you know, every single thing we've talked about,
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.980]   including by the way, stereo Bluetooth, you know,
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.900]   A2D, whatever it is, A2DP compatibility,
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.180]   it's all fixable in software.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.380]   And I just keep waiting for that update from Apple.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.220]   I just keep waiting.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.460]   - I can't believe they haven't done it yet.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.740]   I'm guessing that they just keep collecting more bugs
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.780]   and they wanna just maybe maximize the throughput.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.980]   - Yeah.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.260]   Now, you know, I've theorized this many times
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.580]   with people about the iPhone.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   Do we think that the operating system on our iPhones
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.580]   is, was rather the most stable
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.460]   and they rolled out a bunch of features
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.660]   to get it rolled out in time?
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.020]   'Cause you know, they did that with OS X.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.980]   When OS X first came out, the public betas were far beyond
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.580]   the actual 10.0 release.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.220]   - I think that's pretty normal in a computer,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.820]   which is, and the same thing happened with Vista.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.740]   You take out features that aren't rock solid
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.940]   so that you can have a release.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.580]   And I would expect that with the iPhone.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.300]   - 'Cause like, I think that's where I chat, Lent.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.820]   - I think they had every intention of having lists.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.660]   - Yeah.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.700]   - The obvious things.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.460]   - I'll tell you, one thing that's driving me crazy
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.300]   is none of the ringtones are cutting paces big.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.980]   - Yeah, that's huge.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.780]   - But none of the ringtones are loud enough.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.180]   I miss calls 'cause I can't hear it.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.020]   - Yeah.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.700]   - And one of the cutting paces, I mean, so does it recognize
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.980]   phone numbers wherever you are?
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.020]   Can you do phone numbers when you recognize it?
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.060]   - You can click on phone numbers in mail.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.220]   You can click in phone numbers.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.740]   I don't know if in the notepad you can click on phone numbers.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.100]   - What about SMS?
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.660]   - I think yes. - SMS it does.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.500]   I think anytime someone sends you seven or 10 numbers
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.100]   in a row, it thinks it's a phone number.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:54.940]   - Let me try it.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.220]   - I'll tell you what's really cool is that it sees things
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.820]   like 1-800-MI-APPLE and dials the number.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.660]   - And they...
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.460]   - It doesn't do it in the past.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.940]   - Like old fashioned.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.460]   - Doesn't do it in no-peh, but that makes sense
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.380]   'cause that's pretty free form text.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.420]   - I'm just gonna actually send someone a text message
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.460]   that says Pennsylvania 6500.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.620]   It'll either play a Millie Vanilly song
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.260]   or it'll dial the number.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:25.780]   - They should have a Glen Miller dashboard widget.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.140]   - I think that.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.220]   - I would totally install it.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.060]   - I would totally install it.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.260]   - I think everybody should have,
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.980]   well, you should bring back all of those extensions.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.820]   - You know there's a petition online to do that?
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.340]   I stumbled across it the other day
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.100]   'cause I was trying to find what my phone number is in New York.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.580]   - There's a whole site, there's a whole site about it.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.860]   - It's great.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.860]   - And you go in and you can find out what,
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   like in my neighborhood, I used to be called Overland
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.380]   was my neighborhood. - Oh, that's nice.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.460]   - And you can go out and find and put on business cards
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.420]   and be old-timey and say, "Oh, I like..."
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.260]   - I'm saying...
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.020]   - And there are people in New York who still, you know,
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.900]   who have Park View and...
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.660]   - My numbers are seven.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.260]   - You'll see in movies, you'll see,
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.260]   on the side of a truck or something, sometimes you'll see.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.900]   - PA, PA 649 through.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.980]   My first two digits are seven, six,
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.900]   so it would have to be, the only vowel is the six is O,
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.540]   so it would have to be like pot-belly nine, 4,000.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.980]   (laughing)
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.900]   - I think that'll work.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.620]   I'm gonna start using that.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.420]   - The Telephone Exchange Name Project.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.780]   - Yeah, that's what I stumbled on.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.180]   - So you could find out what your name would be from,
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   in the old days?
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.740]   - Look at this here, but the way it was--
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.540]   - Unless you're one of the unfortunate ones
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.100]   who have a one or a zero is the second digit of your prefix.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.620]   - Telephone Name Exchange Project.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.460]   - I think this is it.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.420]   I think there used to be a forum.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.420]   One of these, there was a forum,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.580]   and people would go and talk about it
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.220]   and post what they remembered about--
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.020]   - Of course, all of New York, you know, was at it,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.900]   but I don't know if, you know, the places like where I live.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.740]   - Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.260]   - Oh, I think it, no, it did, 'cause my parents,
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.460]   I remember finding one of their old bell phones,
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.660]   and it had the sticker on it that said, you know,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.860]   "Victor six" on it.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.980]   - Well, here's mob bells officially recommended exchange names.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.900]   So let's see, I have seven six.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   It's either Poplar, Porter, Rockwell, Roger, or Southfield.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.700]   Hey, that's cool. - Cool.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.700]   - That's really cool.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.740]   I thought everybody from now on, let's use the first.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.940]   - Yeah, we should all be a little bit more old-timey,
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.740]   let's go forward that. - Yeah, especially with cell phones.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.060]   (laughing)
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.740]   Call my cell phone, Poplar seven, two, one, two, one.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.140]   (laughing)
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.980]   - I love it!
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.580]   We should crowdsource somebody to do some kind of app
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   that makes that possible.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.460]   - So give me, what are the first two digits
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.660]   of your phone number, Scott?
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.500]   - Two five.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.100]   - Two five. - Dollar sign, dollar sign.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.100]   - Two five, yeah.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:42.940]   (laughing)
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.100]   - I'm believe. - My two favorite digits, thank you.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.260]   - So you could be Alpine, Blackburn, Clearbrook,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.100]   Clearwater, Clifford. - Or Clinton.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.780]   - Wow. - I like Clinton.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.700]   - Clinton would probably be seven.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.380]   - New York, because of the neighborhood.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.700]   See, they use five five.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.460]   Oh, it says in 1955, this was reserved
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.260]   for radio telephone numbers, so you can't.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.140]   See, they used to do that with five five.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.980]   'Cause you know, when you see five five five,
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.260]   one, two, three, four, you know it's a fake number.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.580]   So sometimes-- - Let's go, let's go,
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.420]   let's call this Klondike.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.140]   - Yeah, they'd use Klondike or something.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.100]   - Yeah. - Yeah, Klondike five, six thousand.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.540]   And then you would try to dial it and you go,
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.900]   wait a minute, that's five five!
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   - So let's go ahead ahead.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.860]   - Slowly after-- - I'm old enough to remember
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.020]   in Indiana where I grew up, LH6.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.380]   - LH6.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.980]   - Which was our first designation, we had a party line.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.900]   - Whoa. - Party lines, wow.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   - Oh, I like my, okay, my iPhone is Empire 4.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.340]   - Mine is Empire. - Empire is good.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.660]   - I like Empire. - I like that, I'm keeping that.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.460]   It's either Empire or Endicott.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.700]   (laughing)
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.940]   - Ooh, that's classy.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.580]   - Endicott, six, four, three, nine, two!
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.100]   - Endicott is-- - I'm putting that on my cards
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.500]   from now on.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.980]   - The, someone was literally just telling me
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.700]   this the other day, Endicott is the,
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.100]   is a neighborhood in Manhattan.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.700]   Why can't you be more like Endicott?
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.940]   (laughing)
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.620]   (sighing)
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.500]   - I think the question is whether this will cause
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.740]   any trouble with the Duke wireless network.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.700]   - Yeah, I was just about to mention that.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.820]   (laughing)
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.460]   - Telephone exchange names, Flash, Break the Duke.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.540]   Why find that work?
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.540]   So this guy, I'm really annoyed at this guy.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.700]   Go ahead.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.780]   - It just turned out it wasn't the iPhone,
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.300]   it was the, it was Cisco routers.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.420]   - Oops.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.060]   - You know, the beauty part is in Duke's own announcement though.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.380]   The second paragraph says,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.620]   Cisco worked closely with Duke and Apple
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.220]   to identify the source of this problem.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.060]   - Yeah, it's better they did.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.260]   - What the hell are you talking about?
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.420]   - I could just see Apple, yeah.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.660]   You know, actually, let me go ahead
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.860]   and tell you the source of the problem, not us.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.700]   - What a whack.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.460]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.380]   What I love is the Duke guy in charge of infrastructure
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.660]   who said it couldn't possibly be the Cisco routers.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.100]   It has to be the iPhone.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.380]   - I ordered those.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.380]   (laughing)
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.740]   - That's an iPhone Haida at work there.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.820]   That's a guy who is so convinced.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.540]   I mean, you wouldn't even come up with that as an answer
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.660]   unless you just really wanted to hate the iPhone.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.500]   - You know what that is?
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.540]   That's the kind of thing, like when you have kind of,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.780]   again, thinking in terms of almost like the cargo cult,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.620]   when you have the incomplete knowledge of something,
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.060]   you always leap to the first thing that's changed
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.380]   and assume that that's it.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.140]   And it's way off, you know, the kind of Occam's razor approach
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.820]   that actually gets problems solved.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.900]   - Kevin Miller, let's give him a credit, Mr. Occam.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.740]   Kevin Miller's assistant director,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.580]   communications infrastructure with Duke's Office
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.540]   of Information Technology.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.140]   He can be reached at Jackass675.8.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.400]   (laughing)
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.420]   - Well, I'm gonna try to find the quote here
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.580]   'cause I remember him saying specifically.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.940]   - I'm gonna try for Jackass.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.780]   (laughing)
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.620]   - J.A.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.380]   - The interesting thing I think that we're seeing more of
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.580]   is a lot of the IT professionals feeling it.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.860]   I mean, I think that a lot of times,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.980]   we kind of grew to be kind of the way we are about our Macs
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.060]   because a lot of times we felt besieged.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.020]   You know, there was all these--
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.340]   - That's right, we were the viewers.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.220]   - Yes.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.100]   - And what's interesting is that you're getting this feeling,
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.620]   at least working with a lot of the IT groups,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.260]   at least that I deal with,
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.100]   is that they're now feeling besieged.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.380]   You know, there's more and more pressure
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.020]   about all this Apple product and these computers
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.820]   and all this stuff and they wanna live
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.860]   in their little PC world
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.700]   and they're having a much harder time doing it
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.740]   and getting much more defensive about it.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.980]   - For those who wanna get more technical,
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.020]   what they're having, they're having,
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.540]   they were having ARP floods and they thought
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.660]   that it was iPhones that were creating
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.300]   the ARP floods, it was in fact a single Cisco wireless router
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.100]   that was creating the ARP floods.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.820]   But they were very quick.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.060]   So far, the Duke troubleshooters are pretty sure
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.980]   it's the iPhone and not the university Cisco infrastructure
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.940]   that's causing this drive to disruptions.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.860]   - I agree though with the IT people and Macs
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.540]   'cause like I remember when I showed up at CBS
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.860]   to the 386 sitting on my desk, I'm not kidding
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.300]   and it had an RGB monitor.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.140]   - Ooh.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.980]   - Ooh.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.660]   - And I brought them to Windows.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.420]   - Yeah, it was Windows 95.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.260]   - It was 3.1.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.100]   - Oh God.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.780]   - It was terrible and it was so bad that I said,
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.020]   well I'm just gonna bring my own computer
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.420]   and I brought in my power book.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.620]   - And this was and the IT guy.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.060]   - You were to tech TV, right?
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.060]   - Yeah, this was like 2003.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.060]   - Shh.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.540]   - And the IT guy freaked out.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.380]   - Wow.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.420]   - Don't plug that in, you'll break the network
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.660]   and it's like, is it an IP based network?
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.100]   - It's an exchange server.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.940]   - Oh.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.900]   - I don't care about the email, I want, is it IP or not?
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.660]   I mean it was like, they just don't know.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.220]   - It's on direct current.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.060]   - Yeah.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.500]   - They don't know anything about Macs.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.100]   They just, my first, my dot com job,
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.780]   I arrived, started as a freelance gig
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.820]   and turned into a job that I arrived
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.740]   and I, like an idiot, I show up and I'm like,
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.460]   hey, so where do I plug in?
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.580]   They're like, you're kidding me.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.860]   You're not gonna plug that in here.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.580]   We don't even know what would happen if you plugged in.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.460]   You can't print, what are you crazy?
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.740]   You know the footprint that's involved
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.180]   in getting printing on NT, that's not gonna happen.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.140]   It's just, you know, this is in here.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.340]   Now, you know, I don't like to be the Uber fan boy
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.260]   but I will just say that for those of us
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.580]   who still feel that pang, we remember the mid 90s
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.700]   and we remember the bad old day.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.820]   It's not like we're, you know,
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.460]   we're not like we're, you know,
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.460]   mega-everage or something but we were discriminated
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.740]   against on a certain, in a certain way.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.420]   - I have a dream.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.940]   - To know, but you know, I don't wanna email a dramatic
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.180]   but I mean, it was, there was a very, very hostile
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.500]   environment that people have totally forgotten about
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.340]   and I, I'm not gonna forget it personally.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.820]   I got treated really badly for using Macs for years.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.860]   Hey, good news by the way,
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.700]   AppleCare is now available for the iPhone.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.340]   So those of you who have been feeling a little bit
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.100]   out floating in space today, Apple announced that,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.060]   or yesterday Apple announced that you can't get AppleCare
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.900]   for your iPhone.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.420]   - Which I highly suggest on most products in general.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.260]   - Really?
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.020]   I know you and Scott are big AppleCare.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.300]   - My gosh, I mean, we, every computer that we've ever gotten
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.900]   that didn't have AppleCare, I wish we had AppleCare.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.940]   - And it's like, have, have just walked in.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.060]   I don't know the details of this.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.700]   I don't know if he had much because he's out,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.780]   but he like walked into the store and walked out
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.620]   with a new one.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.540]   - Well, every iPhone comes with, this is from Apple,
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.660]   one year of hardware repair coverage
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.020]   up to two years of technical support.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.820]   The AppleCare Protection Plan for iPhone
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.900]   extends your repair coverage to two years.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.020]   So you already have one year
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.620]   from the original purchase date of your iPhone.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.020]   It's 169 bucks, little price.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.860]   - No, it's 69 bucks.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.220]   - 69 bucks. - I thought it was 69 bucks.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.580]   - Well, I'm sorry, you're right, it's 69.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.660]   That's fine, that's appropriate.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.540]   - And they're not available to residents of Alabama,
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.820]   Connecticut, Nevada, Wyoming,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.700]   or the exchange Porterfield 9, 7000.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.960]   (laughing)
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.660]   - I'm gonna buy it for some of the company phones,
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.220]   but not my personal phone, given the fact
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.140]   that I don't expect to hang on to my personal phone
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.780]   through Web2. - So you already got a year.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.460]   I think a year's plenty.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.860]   - I'll be done with this phone in a year
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.420]   'cause I'll have Rev2 by the way.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.740]   - I know, I'm assuming with this one,
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.420]   I'm probably gonna have Rev2 as well, so I'm not.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.860]   But I will say in general for Mac users,
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.340]   I mean, maybe that we just use our computers really hard,
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.380]   but we've taken, and we do use them very hard,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.700]   but we take almost all of them back for some reason,
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.820]   and usually it gets near the end of the three years,
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.100]   and there's little niggly things
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.540]   that you wouldn't normally pay attention to,
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.620]   but you take it back in and you have them,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.060]   prep it, prep it up, before the end of its three year curve.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.860]   Actually, I probably shouldn't,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.460]   now the guys at Apple are gonna be rolling their eyes,
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.180]   'cause there's always little things
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.660]   that aren't quite right on your computer,
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.980]   and you never go, you never bothered
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.900]   to handle them, especially when it's out of warranty,
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.420]   and you get to, between two and three years of a laptop,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.700]   for instance, at least my laptop,
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.380]   I mean, I travel two weeks of the month,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:49.260]   and so it's been through a lot of battles,
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.100]   it's typically been on three or four continents,
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.620]   it's been in dust and everything else.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.460]   It just doesn't run as well as it did when I bought it,
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.020]   so I take it back in between two and three years
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.620]   on the AppleCare, and they clean it all up,
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.380]   and they fix little things, and then they give it back to me,
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.460]   and that would cost me a lot of money if I had,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.300]   you know, and have the Apple.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.140]   - It's worth it.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.100]   So I'm reading from the quick conference call notes
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.580]   posted at macrumors.com,
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.060]   and one of the questions somebody asked,
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.380]   not MacRumors, but somebody asked on the conference call
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.420]   about the fact that there are iPhone,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.180]   or they mentioned the iPhone price points,
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.460]   should we assume we'll have a family of iPhones?
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.500]   Here was Apple's response,
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.900]   was it, who was it the CFO that was talking?
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.980]   I don't have a name of whoever's talking,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.540]   but he's obviously mastered the art of PR.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.500]   - His response to, should we assume we'll have a family
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.660]   of iPhones is, we believe the iPhone offers tremendous value
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.380]   that customers couldn't even imagine before.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.340]   It's three products in one.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.140]   - Did you really say that?
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.380]   - According to the MacRumors,
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.740]   unless they cut and paste the copy from the ad,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.060]   I don't know where they got that.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.220]   - Well, you know, here's the thing,
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.460]   you cut and pasted from an ad.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.420]   - That's ridiculous.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.900]   It's not, it's talking about not answering the question.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.660]   - Well, you know what, more than likely,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.340]   if he did answer the question,
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   somebody would sue him.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.500]   - He can't answer the question,
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.900]   but he should just say, "I can't answer that."
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.380]   - Looking statements, you know.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.500]   - Well, I mean, he didn't have a,
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.980]   somebody asked him about the number of Apple TV unit sales,
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.780]   and he said, "We don't announce that level of product detail."
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.220]   I mean, they could have said that,
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.140]   but I guess it just felt like it was time to say,
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.740]   "It's three, no."
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.580]   - Three. - They give 'em.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.860]   - Three products.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.060]   - They give 'em talking points,
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.620]   that's what they're supposed to do.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.460]   - Yeah. - And that's what
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.180]   any good company-- - Of course.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.620]   - These are minefields, these analyst conference calls.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.900]   - And you can, yeah.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.780]   - You can bet that some of these questions are being asked
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.300]   just to see if they can trip 'em up.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.140]   - Yeah, well, I would.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.980]   Hey, I'm a, you know, if you're a journalist in there,
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.220]   you're trying to get this information,
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.940]   if he accidentally tells you, "Oh, that's great."
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.180]   - And it's just that, but you know,
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.140]   going against Apple there, you're gonna lose.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.380]   It's better to try to break into AT&T.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.460]   I've gotten a lot more information out of backrooms
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.620]   in AT&T than Apple.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.860]   - Can you imagine, before they do these conference calls,
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.020]   how many days prepping?
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.180]   - Oh. - You know, how about all
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.780]   the lawyers in there saying, "You can't say that,
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.260]   you can't, don't forget." - Yep.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.580]   - Oh, yeah. - They probably have some of them.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.380]   - It's probably like Steve preparing
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.300]   for the Mac world keynote.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.020]   - Oh, yeah, 'cause I've heard his intense.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.420]   - But this is worse than that, 'cause I mean,
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.340]   Steve's not making, this is not an analyst conference call.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.380]   I mean, Steve's just, of course,
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.020]   he still has to watch out as a,
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.140]   I never wanna go public.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.020]   I don't know how these guys handle it, frankly.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.100]   It's crazy, especially in the days of Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.540]   It's just nuts.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.420]   - What you saw creative is moving to Singapore.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.820]   Is it Singapore?
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.900]   You know, they've always been an Asian company anyway,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.740]   haven't they?
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.540]   - Yeah, they're gonna delist from Nasdaq
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.140]   as of August 31st. - For the rest of the day.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.540]   - Yeah, Devorah. - And it's on a crusade
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.820]   against Socks, I mean, I don't blame him.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.180]   - Oh, it's a well-intentioned law
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.300]   that's really hurting people. - Yeah.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   - Well, he says that's why you don't see any IPOs anymore.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.620]   You don't, nobody wants to go public.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.220]   - There are people who are going public,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.700]   they're just not going public here.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.220]   - Brett's gonna have to leave us in a few minutes,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.180]   so I wanna get to our picks of the week.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.460]   Brett Larson, why don't you start,
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.500]   and that way if you have to run,
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.580]   what do I get to pick?
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.900]   - Well, baby, before we do that,
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.860]   I'm gonna give you a chance to think.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   We usually, I didn't warn you,
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.700]   but we usually do a software pick of the week.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.620]   And you don't have to, it's not required.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.700]   - Yes, he does.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.260]   - I haven't really-- - Think about it,
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.260]   I'm gonna give you a minute. - Don't anything.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.180]   - Because before we do that,
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.940]   we wanna do our Audible Book Pick of the Week.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.780]   This is something we do on every show.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.500]   Audible is a sponsor of most of the Twitch podcasts.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.780]   We really appreciate their support.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.860]   If you wanna join Audible and get a book for free,
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.900]   get a credit tour to book,
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.260]   just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.980]   And if you're already a member,
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.140]   well, just look at some of the books.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.820]   We've recommended now dozens of great books.
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.580]   And I think, Merlin, man, you were interested.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.300]   Did you come up with a book or--
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.580]   - I absolutely have one.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.060]   - All right, what's your pick of the week?
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.900]   This is our book club section now.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.260]   I love it, it's so much fun, I tell ya.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.860]   - It's a wonderful novel called Angela's Ashes.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.860]   You've gotta read it.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.660]   (laughing)
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.100]   Actually, that is, by the way,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.540]   that is an excellent, highly recommended Audible Book.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.700]   - Listen, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.420]   I heard it on Oprah, I have not read the book.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.700]   - Oh, not only is it a great book, but he reads it.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.700]   He reads it. - That's a bear,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.940]   you wanna take the pick, you want it?
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.620]   - No, go ahead and do it, but I'm glad you--
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.060]   I know you're being facetious, but in fact,
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.980]   that is a wonderful Audible Book.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.420]   - Is that Frank McCourt?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.380]   - Frank McCourt reads Angela's Ashes,
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.460]   and he has to read it because it's got that Irish brogue.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.300]   - Yeah.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.980]   - When he says, what is this for breakfast?
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.260]   She says, "Next, she'll be wanting an egg."
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.740]   It just really comes home, it's wonderful.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.460]   Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead, what is your pick?
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.020]   - Oh no, my book of the week is a,
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.140]   I think of all the books that I've talked about on the site.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.340]   The book, obviously, I talk about the most on 43 folders.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.900]   It's Getting Things Done by David Allen.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.940]   But probably in the long run,
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.700]   over the whatever three years I've done the site,
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.020]   the one I talk about the second most
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.180]   is called the Now Habit.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.340]   - Oh, Neil Fiore.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.260]   - Neil Fiore.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.380]   - Is that on the book?
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.540]   - He's a hypnotist, I didn't know this.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.620]   - And is it a hypnotist?
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.460]   - I've read the book and recommended it.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.460]   - It's a hypnotist, it's a hypnotist.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.580]   But he, this is a fantastic book.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.420]   If you've ever struggled with procrastination,
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.580]   you know how difficult it can be
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.180]   to help yourself with that problem because--
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.500]   - I was gonna make this my pick, but I put it off
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.340]   and now it's--
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.180]   - Really?
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.020]   - No, I'm just kidding.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.940]   - Oh, see, you're gonna,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.580]   - And it's a little furry there, that was a little funny.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.500]   - Book is in, all right, you're dead to me.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.780]   (laughing)
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.260]   So the problem is that when you procrastinate,
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.340]   you tend to be really hard on yourself.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.700]   And Neil Fiore, one of his big things is like,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.420]   this just kind of makes it worse.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.260]   - Yes.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.100]   - The more that you're like hard on yourself.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.500]   And he has this whole kind of really fascinating,
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.940]   almost reverse psychology approach to procrastination.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.660]   - Well, he's big on leisure, which I think is great.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.940]   In fact, because of him, I force myself
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.580]   to take a day off every week now.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.820]   - One of the things he recommends
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.300]   is something called the unschedule,
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.620]   where you actually go in and only schedule things
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.180]   that you want to do and would like to do.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.500]   Anyway, there's, I think you'll enjoy it.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.540]   I think it's a book that would actually be pretty good.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.140]   I haven't heard the actual audio version.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.860]   I've read the dead tree version, probably five times.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.340]   - Yeah, I got it on your recommendation, actually.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.380]   - It's, I find it inspiring.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.020]   I gotta say, anytime I find myself feeling
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.940]   a little bit wound up about what I'm not doing,
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.060]   I'll read a few pages and it's great.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.420]   - I think it was. - The now habit, yeah.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.620]   - I think it was because of,
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.860]   it was the first time we ever talked
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.500]   that you told me to get that book.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.340]   (laughing)
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.180]   - I'm not kidding.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.540]   - Is it going away?
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.740]   Don't bother me again till you've read the now habit.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.220]   - You gotta be careful how you recommend books to people.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.340]   - Sometimes.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.260]   - No, I bought it immediately and I read it.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.700]   Now I haven't, I have listened to getting things done.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.820]   David Allen reads that on Audible and that is excellent,
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.660]   but I haven't heard Neil.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.860]   Let me see, is Neil, yeah, he's reading it himself.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.660]   - It's up and it's, I checked it's one credit.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.220]   - Let's see how hypnotic is it.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.060]   You wanna hear his voice?
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:44.900]   You have hypnotic?
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.740]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.580]   - Here's Neil Fiore.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.220]   - We start on now.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.260]   The skills and strategies of the now habit program
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.540]   will let you think of yourself as a producer.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.580]   - Feel like a producer and act like a producer.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.060]   - I feel so relaxed now.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.900]   - I don't know.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   - It's the same guy that does Pizz.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.940]   - Pizz is, no.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.580]   If Pizz is were unaudible, we'd recommend that, but it's not.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.820]   - And I just wanna know something, Merlin, for credit.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.660]   - Yes.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.420]   - For credibility sake, can you testify here
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.740]   that you have not been hypnotized
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.460]   into recommending this book?
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.860]   (laughing)
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.020]   - Well, I'm,
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.780]   - Say the word monkey and see what happened.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.060]   - What happened was, is Merlin had a meeting with him.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.220]   And then, and then, oddly, just wanted to read the book
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   over and over and over again.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.060]   - You know what?
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.780]   I have not been hypnotized by Neil.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.860]   I've never met the man and I've read the book
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.260]   and I think it's a fantastic book.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.380]   - I don't know, I might wanna withdraw it.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.260]   He might hypnotize me.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.100]   I'm not gonna lie to you.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.140]   - No, no, it's really good.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.820]   And I've learned, I haven't finished the book,
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.900]   but I think it's usual.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.740]   (laughing)
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.580]   I'm not kidding.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.580]   - These really fascinating.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.100]   - It is truly the story of my life.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.060]   I literally started it and I put it down,
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.300]   but, 'cause I just haven't gotten around to reading the rest,
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.540]   but I did get a lot out of it and one thing was to take time off
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.340]   and to really, and it actually is great.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.940]   And worrying about procrastinating is the thing that kills you.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.100]   - It's absolutely true.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.540]   And you know one thing, one thing about the book
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.940]   I wanna mention now, a lot of these,
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.020]   I wanna come up with a term for this,
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.060]   but there's this certain kind of self-help book
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.820]   that would make like an excellent brochure,
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.100]   that you could basically put on one loosely sheet of paper
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.580]   and get all the concepts.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.980]   And so, a lot of times, for a lot of these books,
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.660]   you can jump straight to chapter five in those cases,
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.940]   'cause there's just hand waving.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.540]   In his case, I gotta say for once, I like the hand waving,
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.580]   'cause the way that he explains why this happens
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.900]   is a lot of the trick.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.980]   So, the two areas that I really recommend,
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.140]   I don't have the book in front of me right now,
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.820]   but I love the section where he's kind of explaining
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.220]   how this happens and he has a great section
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.980]   on basically tricks, ways to psych yourself out.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.580]   - It is psychoanalysis, frankly.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.580]   I mean, it's very useful.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.620]   - I could see that.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.860]   - And what's nice, by the way, another nice feature
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.540]   is you can download, sometimes on the audio books,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.260]   you miss out on the illustrations,
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.580]   you can download the accompanying illustrations.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.340]   There's a reference guide you can download,
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.980]   which is great, yeah.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.820]   - Edo.
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.740]   - Yeah, so if you go to audible.com,
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.580]   if you're gonna read the book,
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.380]   get the reference guide as well.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.300]   - I have to say also, as a companion video to this book,
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.140]   you really have to see the Zayfran thing on "Prograstination."
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.980]   (laughing)
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.820]   - I bet.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.260]   - You guys seen that? - I bet, no.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.700]   - Oh my gosh, it is both hilarious
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.900]   and strikes right to the bone perfectly.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:22.900]   - You can download.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:23.900]   - Did you read the book?
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.500]   - Yeah, I saw it, I actually posted it on 40 days.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.340]   - Oh, I'll watch it.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.660]   - It's really, it's really funny.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.060]   - You can download his guide on how to use the unscheduled.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.020]   It's 15 pages of PDF from the audible site, so.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.580]   And it's actually a really good step by step
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.780]   on using the unscheduled.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   You can walk through it.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.220]   And he has a bunch of exercises,
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.820]   a relaxing exercise, a focusing exercise,
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.660]   a centering exercise.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.700]   - And I mean, just the final, final thing.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.060]   I mean, I think I picked up a lot of this from "Mossmosis."
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.660]   So if you like things like the "Procrastination Dash"
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.140]   on 43 folders, this is gonna be straight up your alley.
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:58.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.580]   - That's our book, "Pick of the Week" Neil Fiore's,
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.420]   "The Now Habit."
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.820]   You can get that free or any book at all on Audible.
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.060]   You get a credit towards a free book
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.380]   just by going to audible.com/macbreak, signing up
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.300]   and downloading your book.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.140]   I think you're gonna love audible.com.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:13.980]   I really do.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.100]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.620]   We know that if you listen to a podcast,
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.020]   you're gonna be an Audible subscriber.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.660]   You're just gonna love it.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.980]   - Now we've given you plenty of time.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.820]   - Yes.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.460]   - For at Larson to come up with a software pick.
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:31.060]   - I rummaged through my applications for--
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.900]   - I often do that for my picks.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.740]   - I totally do that.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.900]   - And I stumbled across an application
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.700]   that I actually was told about years ago,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   got and enjoyed, it's called Megaseg, M-E-G-A-S-E-G.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.500]   And Leo, you could probably echo this.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.980]   Since I came from radio, I like the crossfading on iTunes,
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.300]   but I like it to be a little tighter.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.700]   - It's not very good.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.460]   - Yeah, and Megaseg is actually,
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.060]   if you really wanna sit down with all 11,000 songs
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.260]   in your iTunes library, you can customize the point
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.060]   at which the song will trigger the next song.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.140]   - Now does that modify iTunes?
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.740]   - It does not, it does not.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.260]   - So you have to use Megaseg to do the playback from now on.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.500]   - You do, it's Megaseg is basically DJ software.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.340]   - Got it.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.460]   - But if you really wanna get specific with your music
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.180]   and categorize it and have auto-built playlists
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.180]   based on A songs and B songs.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.060]   - See, you're a radio guy, I understand this completely.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.180]   - Yeah, so I always enjoy that.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.220]   - When you start the next song, you get them to mesh out.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.220]   - Scott Bourne, you'd probably dig it too.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.740]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a very plain interface.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.140]   I mean, it's clearly made for people who do, you know,
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.540]   DJ at weddings, it's very simple.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.380]   But--
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.260]   - And I'm gonna apply for one of those jobs next week,
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   so this will be handy.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.820]   (laughing)
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.860]   - What's your stock price picks not going off
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:54.700]   as well as your life?
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.540]   (laughing)
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.420]   - Actually, you can start DJing at weddings.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.020]   - I think no extra money, you know.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.020]   - I think Merlin's the only guy on this podcast
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.740]   who hasn't, you know, slaved in the vineyards
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.140]   of the record industry, right?
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.620]   - I'd make an excellent wedding DJ though.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.020]   Okay, so I've read it to come out and do the chicken dance.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.860]   Okay.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.260]   (laughing)
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.580]   (cheering)
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.980]   - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.180]   I just wanna say I did 300 weddings, you know,
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.940]   over two years.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.220]   - I'm proud to say I've never DJ'd in public,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.140]   only in a small padded room.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.660]   - I once had to play the electric slide nine times.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.500]   (laughing)
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.340]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.180]   - I'd be honest.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.020]   - I'd be like nine times
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.820]   'cause the bride would keep on coming up and going,
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.700]   "I think they're ready.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.540]   Let's play it again."
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.300]   And I'd be like, "I don't think they're ready.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.140]   I don't think they wouldn't--
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.860]   - I mean, they weren't doing it each time they wouldn't do it.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.700]   - No, they'd come out.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.260]   They'd come out every single time, but it was just like,
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.380]   but they were coming down because the bride was out there.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.460]   You know, so the bride wanted to do it over and over
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.700]   and over again. - Hey, it's her wedding.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.380]   That's the first thing you'll learn.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.500]   - It's surreal.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.340]   No, she's the boss.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.180]   - Thank you, Brett.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.020]   Do you wanna take off?
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.340]   'Cause I know you had a four o'clock.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.860]   I'm gonna dive out of here.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.900]   Great to talk to you. - It's been great.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:00.940]   - We love having you on the show.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.460]   Brett Larson is a scene regularly on Fox 5 in New York City.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.220]   - Seven days a week.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   - He is the technology and environment reporter.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.060]   Is there anything else I could plug for you, my friend?
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.300]   - You know, I still do radio on 1010 wins.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.140]   - Wait a minute, I didn't know that.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.660]   - You can hear my tech bites every Sunday through Thursday
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.500]   on 1010 wins.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.180]   - Tech bites with Brett Larson.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.020]   - Yes.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:21.860]   - Yep.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:22.700]   - It's very exciting.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.540]   - Thank you, Brett.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.460]   We'll talk to you real soon.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.300]   - Talk to you guys later.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.140]   - Take care. - Take care.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:26.980]   - Bye-bye.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.140]   - Now time for another software pick.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.340]   Who wants to go next? Show of hands.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.260]   - Ooh, me, me.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.900]   - Okay, Alex.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.060]   - So I have one that I'm just starting to play with.
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:39.100]   And this was actually suggested on the Mac break,
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.700]   the MBW ideas by one of our listeners.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.540]   - I bet I know what it is.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.380]   - We get great suggestions.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.340]   By the way, thank you so much.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.220]   If you are a delicious user,
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.980]   anytime you tag something MBW ideas,
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.300]   it shows up for us and we really appreciate
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.900]   those suggestions. They're often quite--
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.500]   - And really people should know when they're listening.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.540]   It's the thing that I do before the show
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.860]   is I started going through all of those
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.940]   and trying to make sure that I'm looking for interesting ones
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.020]   and looking for ones that we should look at
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.220]   and looking at the software people suggest.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.660]   So it really does make a difference, though,
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.500]   to post this. - Oh, yeah, we love this.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.740]   - V-W ideas. - Can I guess?
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.780]   - So Merlin, can you guess which one I'm gonna recommend?
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.100]   - I like. - What?
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.820]   - I like highlight.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.900]   - No. - Oh, okay, good.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.900]   - Jing. - Jing.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.740]   - Have you seen Jing?
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.940]   - Oh, yeah. - J-I-N.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.260]   - So Jing is, it's J-I-N-G
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:28.100]   and it's the Jing project, I think, JingProject.com.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.260]   Now, this is a project being done by TechSmith
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.380]   who does Camtasia on the PC. - I love them, yeah.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.740]   - Oh, I know about that.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.940]   They've been talking about Jing for a while.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.700]   - Yeah, so they've posted it,
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.820]   I think it's a beta right now,
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.060]   I think you can just download it, it's free,
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.540]   it's a zero Alex.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.300]   And I'm sure it'll cost something at some point in time,
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.780]   but right now, what it does is you can do it on a Mac or PC.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.900]   And this is the first time you've had one application
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.540]   for screen grabs 'cause we use Snapsi Pro
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.100]   and I show you on the Mac and then Camtasia
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.340]   on the PC for recording training.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.460]   And this is not a replacement for either of those,
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.780]   it's not gonna do what those are gonna do remotely as well
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.740]   because there's not very many preferences,
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.140]   there's not much setup.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.260]   What it does do though, is it lets you basically,
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.540]   when you install it, and this may drive some people crazy,
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.620]   but when you install it, you get a little icon on your,
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.700]   on the Mac, you get it up on your upper corner,
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.660]   which for me, one of the problems is that it conflicts
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.060]   a little bit with exposé, so I had to turn exposé off
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.460]   so that my corner wasn't doing anything,
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.980]   but you get this little yellow icon,
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.380]   and you click on this little button
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:33.940]   and you get this nice little really user friendly thing
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.740]   to just select the area that you wanna capture,
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.900]   and you can capture an image, a video,
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.060]   and you can record something with audio and video
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.140]   and everything else, and then it immediately,
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.980]   it'll make a little link, so you can turn it into a link,
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.660]   upload it real quick, you can post that link
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:52.620]   into an email or on an iChat, so on and so forth,
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.580]   to be able to, if you're talking about something,
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.420]   a lot of times when you're just,
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.580]   you're trying to talk to someone about something
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.700]   that they're working on or something to do,
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.700]   and it's just too hard to put it into text.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.260]   The, we use Snapsi Pro to do a lot of that,
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.540]   but the problem is it's a little heavy for that,
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:11.300]   or I show you, both of them are a little heavy
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.340]   for just showing something, somebody, something,
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.780]   really, really, really fast.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.940]   This is really designed, as I just wanna do a little jot,
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.420]   I wanna jot a note down for someone that's 30 seconds
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.300]   or a minute or two minutes long, and I wanna send it to 'em
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.060]   so they can just see it and then we can keep on talking.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:29.420]   Really, it's a very Mac feeling, it's very,
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.060]   I don't know a Mac, but it's very, the UI has done well,
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.820]   and I would highly suggest checking it out,
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.580]   it's great for just passing ideas around.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:41.060]   - J-I-N-G Project.com, yeah, they,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.100]   we've actually, I think talked with them about sponsorships,
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.420]   they sponsor Labrats, Andy Walker and a Shankarothers show.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.260]   - Oh, cool.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.300]   - And Techsmiths does neat stuff, they,
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.260]   as you mentioned Camtasia, but they also do Snagit,
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.860]   they're known for their Windows stuff,
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:59.620]   and that's, I think, is their first assay into the Mac market.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.380]   - Yeah, we saw them, I think I saw them at the portable
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.100]   media expo last year and talked to 'em about it,
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.340]   and they were very cagey about their Apple development,
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.660]   and this is the first try, it's pretty,
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.220]   it's free right now, right?
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.500]   - Right, it's in big, yeah.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500]   - So definitely check.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.140]   - Yeah, zero Alex, okay, I'm gonna mention something
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.180]   that is both free and paid, and just came out
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.740]   with a new version of the paid version.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.860]   I know Alex, you and I have talked about it before,
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.580]   and it's just, I should talk about it more,
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.620]   'cause it's just one of the greatest free programs
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.180]   ever written for Windows or Mac.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.180]   It's called Art Rage, have we mentioned that before
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.380]   on the show?
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.540]   - It's really great.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.380]   - Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.220]   - I don't think so.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.300]   - I think we've talked about it on, I think on--
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.740]   - On the Lab, call for help.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.580]   - On the Lab.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.380]   - 2.5 just came out, for those of you
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.780]   who are registered users of the full edition,
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.940]   a bunch of new features,
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.180]   but there is still a free version of 2.0,
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:56.820]   and I imagine they'll do 2.5 free as well.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.180]   They've added stencils and rulers
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.260]   and some really nice features to it.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.620]   It is a free art program that is designed for artists.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.420]   It's not a Photoshop, the idea is to give you
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.660]   something you can put on your Mac that you can draw with,
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.340]   and I tell you, I put it on all my Macs, the free version.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.060]   I did pay 25 bucks for the full edition,
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.620]   but I put the free version on all my Macs,
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.940]   'cause I'm hoping my kids will discover it
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.820]   and start playing with it.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.000]   It is so cool.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.660]   It's got a unique user interface, it's got a palette,
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.500]   which is kind of a quarter circle
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.180]   in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.140]   It makes it very easy for you to pick
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.540]   whether it's a paint brush, a watercolor pencil pen,
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.700]   you even have a palette knife,
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.900]   if you're like a smear paint on, a roller, and an airbrush.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.300]   You could choose colors from the right-hand quarter circle,
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.060]   and then you really have most of the screen free for drawing.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.660]   It's just a wonderful tool for creativity.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.180]   Get the free version, you may wanna spend the 25 bucks
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.380]   to upgrade, but for those of you who've ever used Dabler
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:06.380]   or Painter, this is a really nice natural media art program
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.420]   and highly, highly recommended.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.700]   I actually put it on my tablet PC on the Windows side,
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.940]   'cause it's really great with a tablet PC.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.340]   If Apple ever makes a tablet PC, they ought to do it.
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.540]   There's even a UMPC version for people
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.620]   with little tiny, those ultra mobile PCs.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.860]   Artrage from Artrage.com, 2.5 is out for those
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.380]   of you who've already paid the version two,
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:31.380]   the simple version is free still for Mac and Windows.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.820]   My pick of the weeks.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.680]   Scott Bourne, do you have a pick for us?
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.420]   - I do indeed, and my friend Merlin Mann,
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.860]   from 43 Folders, has influenced me to try to make lists.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.460]   (laughing)
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.460]   - I would love to see your lists.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.500]   - Me and those two.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.020]   - Bye, Scotland.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.280]   (laughing)
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.900]   - I was a little upset that Scotland was taken.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.260]   - Yes, sorry, that's too bad, yeah.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.860]   - I try to make lists, and like many of you,
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.340]   I'm a little chagrined at the iPhone's lack
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.940]   of really good list making applications,
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.900]   although I've come up with a few cludges,
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.540]   and then someone pointed me to Tada.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.460]   Tada, this.com.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.420]   - From 37 signals, yeah.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.940]   - 37 signals, and I thought, you know,
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.460]   with a name like 37 signals,
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.740]   it's gotta be pretty close to 43 Folders,
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.340]   and you know, it's got a number in the name anyway.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   - It's true, we live in a tree house together.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.580]   - Yeah, I checked it out,
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.140]   and they have a nice iPhone version that's iPhone optimized,
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.220]   and you can make a nice list.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.860]   I mean, it's not perfect,
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.820]   you still have to be connected somehow via Edge or Wi-Fi,
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.220]   but if you want a list that's a little more flexible,
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.260]   it's worth a look, you know, and the price is right.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.700]   - Oh, Tada is great, yeah.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.820]   I, you know, and there's also Remember the Milk,
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.700]   which is another very good to-do list online,
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.820]   there are actually quite a few,
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.300]   but Tada works well with the iPhone, and that's the key.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.660]   - I haven't tried it on the iPhone,
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.900]   'cause I don't have an iPhone,
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.740]   but it's worth mentioning that Backpack,
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.420]   my personal favorite 37 signals product got an upgrade today,
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.220]   and it is really sharp.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.380]   So if you've, I'm from it all,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.740]   but to your point, Scott, Tadaless is fantastic,
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.100]   and I think it's, you know why I think it's great,
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.260]   is because it's simple.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.740]   It's, you know, you can't fiddle,
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.260]   it's just a list maker.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:24.060]   - I have my grocery list in Tadaless on my iPhone right now.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.420]   - Nice.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.820]   - Just, I always have to go to-
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.740]   - I always have to go to the first list,
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.620]   and I just go on to something.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.140]   - I just wish you didn't have to go to Safari
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.380]   to use these things, that's just,
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.220]   the only thing.
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.060]   - Perfect, perfect.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:34.900]   - Yeah.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.740]   - Greater.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.060]   - Well, step at a time, sir, once-
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:37.900]   - We're getting there.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.740]   - We're getting there.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:42.140]   - So the our list is T-A-D-A-L-I-S-T.com.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.980]   - Yes it is.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.620]   - And finally, Mr. Mylan Mann.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.660]   - Mine is a freebie, and it is a website,
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:52.460]   not a specifically, a software, a piece of software,
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.700]   but it's for a piece of software.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.260]   My friends at Omni Group,
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.980]   with whom I work on the Omni Focus project,
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.820]   have a wonderful application called Omni Graffle.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.620]   And Omni Graffle, it's funny,
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.820]   'cause it's funny, you talked about drawing,
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.900]   because when it comes to drawing pretty much anything,
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.860]   I love Omni Graffle,
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.060]   'cause just for the kind of stuff I need to do,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.340]   it's somewhere between freehand drawing and illustrator,
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.700]   it's just, it's really easy to just make shapes
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.300]   and do stuff and make diagrams.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.140]   - Does this still-
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.260]   - Almost max the Omni Graffle?
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.900]   - I don't think, I don't know if they do that anymore.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.300]   - It's too bad, 'cause that's how I got to
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   produce it. - It was so nice.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   - Yeah, Omni Outliner and Omni Graffle
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.660]   used to be on every Mac.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.300]   I'm not sure where that stands.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.900]   But if you're a fan of Omni Graffle,
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.580]   there's a wonderful website that is independent
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.940]   of Omni Group, it's called Graffletopia.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:41.860]   G-R-A-F-F-L-E-T-O-P-I-A.com.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.220]   And Graffletopia is a site where people can
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.380]   basically share libraries, stencils,
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.780]   for the Omni Graffle product.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.380]   And there's so many cool stencils,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.980]   and these are basically like templates, right?
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.060]   You can get like-
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.060]   - These are awesome.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.420]   - For making floor plans, for doing sound design,
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.780]   for doing, oh, this is badass,
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.580]   a mobile device wireframe set.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.380]   So if you wanna show a workflow
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.140]   for moving through a wireless,
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.780]   this is such a time saver to have these beautifully done
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.620]   the rack elements.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.180]   If you wanna make put a rack system together,
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.620]   it's beautiful. - This is incredible.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.780]   - Yeah, pretty amazing. - Isn't that a great resource?
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.660]   - I mean, especially 'cause if anyone's used Omni Graffle,
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.820]   I mean, I use Omni Graffle all the time.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.380]   I mean, anytime we need to diagram
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.460]   how something's gonna happen,
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.580]   or what it's gonna do, or I'm sending people out,
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.820]   but this is where we're gonna go.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.740]   It's the application to use.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.260]   And the thing that I'm always worried about,
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.700]   well, the thing that I have to go find
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.100]   are these kind of images, you know,
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.700]   to add to that process.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.300]   So it's a, wow. - Yeah, this is,
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.420]   this is, it comes with a bunch of really nice stencils
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.460]   that you can use, but that's the key.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.420]   I mean, it's nice to be able to draw at Hock stuff,
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.580]   but when you're doing things like wireframes,
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.900]   for websites or doing flows, doing UML,
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.100]   you know, doing any kind of unified modeling,
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.980]   it's, they have so many libraries for this stuff.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.300]   So yeah, Graffletopia.com works with Omni Graffle
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.140]   and costs zero Alex.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.140]   Zero Alex is a good price.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.460]   - We got a lot of zero Alex stuff today.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.900]   - Yeah. - Cheap week.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.740]   - Excellent. - Don't worry,
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.140]   I'll come back with a bang to him next week.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.260]   - He'll make up for it later.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.020]   - I'll be spending your money the next week.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.180]   - All right.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.060]   Well, we, you know, we neglected to mention one big story,
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.580]   which is the iPhone hack.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.640]   Maybe we can wrap up with that.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.340]   A proof of concept hack from security researchers,
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.420]   but pretty effectively demonstrated
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.420]   how if you go to a bad website on the iPhone's browser,
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.780]   they can own your iPhone and pretty much access anything
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.820]   on there, including your voicemail, your SMS messages.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.580]   And in theory, could use your iPhone
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.820]   by making calls and more.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.980]   Pretty nasty.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.380]   Again, it's not out there in the wild,
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.460]   but it's a little bit scary and no response yet from Apple.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.900]   As you say, we haven't had any fixes or patches yet.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.860]   So keep in mind, it's not an iPhone hack.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.260]   It's a Safari hack.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.300]   - Yeah, they said in theory, it would also work on Windows,
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.260]   Safari and Mac Safari, although they hadn't demonstrated that.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.140]   They were able to demonstrate it on the iPhone pretty clearly.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.780]   I mean, they actually did the hack.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.460]   - And what is the way to defeat this hack?
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.180]   The same way you would defeat this hack
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:23.140]   with any decent computer or any reasonable precautions.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.300]   Don't go on to Wi-Fi networks, you don't know and trust.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.220]   You know, it's just common sense stuff
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.060]   and you don't have to worry.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.300]   - The problem is you can say don't go to malicious sites,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.980]   but it's hard to know what a malicious site is.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.100]   And what's particularly concerning,
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.020]   and I don't know exactly the vulnerability.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.820]   I'll have to look at it more closely.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:46.060]   You can read more about it at exploiting iphone.com.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.540]   But what we've seen in the past,
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.540]   vulnerabilities exploited on well-known mainstream sites
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.980]   like MySpace, Tom's Hardware and elsewhere,
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.020]   by embedding them into the code that's being served
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.660]   by the advertising servers.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.100]   And since many sites don't really kind of vet the code
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.540]   they're getting from the advertising servers,
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.500]   that could, I'd have to look at the code
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.020]   to see if that'd be possible.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.660]   - I'd like to hear what our security nest,
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.060]   but MySecurityGuy says,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.340]   "Until they can do executables on your phone,
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.500]   don't worry about it."
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.260]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.180]   Have you looked at the vulnerability?
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.580]   - You know, they demonstrate downloading
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.220]   your voicemail messages and your SMS.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.820]   First of all, I mean, realistically,
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.940]   I see these things not just about the iphone,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.340]   but about all kinds of computers all the time, Leo.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.060]   And when you look into it, you say,
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.460]   "How many guys worked on this nonstop from win to win,
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.380]   and how likely is this to actually happen in the wild,
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.140]   and how much, and name me somebody who's been harmed by it?"
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.540]   That's my first response.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.580]   - Well, it is one of those exploits that is not yet
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.660]   in the public, and that is certainly reassuring.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.740]   But it's always-- - I think it's a good thing
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.780]   because here's why.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.260]   If this is true, Apple will know it's true
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.260]   whether or not they admit it.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.580]   - Well, Apple has admitted it, actually.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.980]   Apple has acknowledged it.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.860]   - Well, then they'll fix it.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.620]   So that's the good thing when people do this,
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.900]   they help them find stuff.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.900]   - Yeah.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.180]   - Yeah, well, we need to know.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.100]   We need to know now.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.900]   - I would like to see a patch.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.740]   - We will.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.580]   - Yeah.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.740]   - Anyway, I think it's good, don't you,
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.620]   that they're looking for it?
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.460]   - Absolutely.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:21.460]   I mean, I guess the issue is a little different
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.380]   on something like the iphone that's so locked down.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.380]   There's not much you can do to protect yourself.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.900]   You can't, for instance, turn off scripting in Safari.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.460]   You can't control Safari in any way.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.540]   So it's a little more concerning,
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.460]   especially since many people will be using this iphone
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.300]   on wifi networks.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.860]   It also joins these networks automatically, so.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.300]   - Well, you can stop that from happening.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.980]   You might want to turn that off.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.300]   - You can stop that from happening,
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.020]   and you can make sure that you're only joining
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.900]   secured trusted wifi.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.020]   - Can you do that? How do you do that?
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.700]   - Simple, first of all, if you go to a wifi network
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.740]   that doesn't require a password, it's not secure.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:02.420]   - So you can say, I want to manually join networks.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.740]   You have that ability to turn off.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:07.860]   - You only use WPA networks, that's all you use.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:08.940]   - That's all I use.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.940]   That's all I use long before I got an iphone,
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.100]   because one of my friends who's a security net job guy
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.100]   who spends all his time trying to write.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:16.940]   - No, it's right, it's, yeah.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.860]   - He said, "Don't ever use your," he said,
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.020]   when I was using a Mac laptop, he said,
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.180]   "Don't ever use your Mac laptop."
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.700]   And this is well before anybody tried to find an exploit.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.900]   He said, "Don't use it to get on a wifi unless
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.340]   there's a security password."
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:31.700]   'Cause he said it, you could be being spoofed.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.300]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.740]   - That are like computer to computer, let's say, links us.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.580]   - Right.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.540]   - I was wondering about that when you're in an airport
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.580]   and you see free wifi, I always think that's got to be kind of a--
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.260]   - Free wifi, it's computer to computer and you're like,
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.100]   "Oh, okay."
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.060]   - Yeah, there's a whole story behind that,
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.380]   which I won't go into, but we've talked about it
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.220]   on security now.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.420]   It's actually is kind of a bug in the windows
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.860]   and the way windows works with open wifi.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.180]   - It's usually an ad hoc--
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.020]   - It's an ad hoc that--
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.940]   - It's a free public wifi, it's harmless.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.420]   But basically, if you've ever seen that access point,
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.180]   it gets added to your list and you start broadcasting that.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.220]   And it's just a bug.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.180]   I think Microsoft did push a patch for it.
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.020]   - Okay.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:09.860]   - But it's--
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:10.700]   - Yeah, great piece of spyware though,
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.540]   it's a good machine.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.300]   - Oh yeah, you should not join it.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.980]   I've talked about it on the radio show
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.740]   a number of times we've talked about it on security now.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.700]   It's an interesting, yeah.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.140]   You'll see these all over free public wifi.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.380]   Harmless, but not, so you certainly,
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.860]   anyway, shouldn't join it 'cause it may not be a harmless one.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.860]   And I think you're right, Scott.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.500]   You shouldn't be joining public networks,
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.900]   although I do it all the time.
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.620]   You should only join password protected networks,
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.300]   otherwise you are very vulnerable.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.140]   - That's another thing.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.260]   - What about like needles I find on the ground?
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.660]   Is it okay to lick those if I find like a half-year needle?
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:43.340]   - Lick 'em, but don't stick 'em, that's kind of my motto.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.660]   - And if it only breaks the skin a little,
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.500]   that's not a big deal.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.660]   - Right, not too--
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.300]   Anything, you know, it's the five second rule.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.140]   If you get it out--
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.060]   - What if it's in like a restroom?
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.460]   Is that like, maybe like resting on a urinal?
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.300]   Is that cool?
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.340]   - Resty or rusty?
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.500]   - Oh, no, no, just resting.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.340]   It was you riding.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]   - Oh, as long as it's not rusty.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.340]   - Okay, all right.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.260]   - Huh, public wifi.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.580]   - Some tips here for our users,
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.580]   something you could learn from.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.660]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.940]   Once again, thanks to Brett Larson,
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.580]   who's long gone from Fox 5 in New York City,
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   Scott Born, ApplePhoneShow.com, the hottest, best Apple Phone
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.860]   podcast right after this one.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.300]   And I'm just kidding.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.140]   I'm just kidding.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.060]   We only get a little app, well, a lot of Apple.
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:22.900]   Nevermind.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.940]   We're not trying to encroach on your territory though.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.780]   - You're welcome to.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.140]   - That's the place to go if you really wanna know.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.500]   Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.780]   and the myrlinshow.com
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.980]   and anything new in the Merlin Show world?
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.460]   - You know Merlin Show's on kind of,
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:41.020]   I think I'm realizing retroactively it's on a hiatus.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.580]   There's something very cool on 43 Folders,
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.620]   something I'm really excited about that I will pimp.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.380]   I spoke at Google on Monday.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.700]   I did one of their tech talks.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.860]   - That's why we're doing this on Wednesday.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.700]   We couldn't do it all day.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.500]   - That's right, 'cause I couldn't make it.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.700]   And it turned out pretty good.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.140]   And just go to 43folders.com.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.540]   You can see the video and the slides
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.380]   of me doing my inbox zero talk.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.940]   - Merlin at Google telling them
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.900]   how to get their inbox to zero.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.580]   - These guys are getting 500 or 600
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:08.700]   just like internal emails every day.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.540]   - See, that's the problem.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.060]   - I can ignore my email because it's,
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.460]   you know, I don't work for anybody.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.420]   But boy, if that's Office mail, what do you do?
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.260]   - It's not, so this is a bunch of stuff that I'm hoping.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.980]   Get your email under control and it's about,
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.300]   it's about 58 minutes, including question and answer.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.220]   And I think it turned out good.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.780]   - 43folders.com.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.620]   - Thanks.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.980]   - And Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.380]   And if you would like to know more about these technologies
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.660]   that are changing the world,
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.660]   this is a great chance for you to get involved.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.580]   The summer deal really isn't much of a deal now
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:38.780]   that we're almost at the end of the summer,
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.820]   but still check it out.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:41.660]   Pixel Core.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.820]   - Still to check with the fall will be coming soon.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.020]   It's gonna be a really, really fun fall.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:46.860]   So I think so.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.020]   - It's a good part of the game.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.540]   - All right guys, we thank you so much.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.900]   Another Mac break.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.740]   - It was bold.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.960]   (upbeat music)
