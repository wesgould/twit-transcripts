[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.600]   He's had some briefings from Apple,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.880]   has lots to tell us about AirTags,

[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.160]   I think you're gonna want it.

[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.200]   the show we cover the latest Apple News.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   Renee Ritchie is here.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.760]   He wasn't here last week.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.880]   He was getting briefed by somebody about something.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.080]   We all watched the event together, Leo.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.160]   They broadcast that to the entire internet.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.720]   Yeah, we all saw.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720]   No spoilers.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.800]   Although I got some spoilers.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.320]   If you didn't watch by now, if you didn't watch by now,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   you're done.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920]   We're gonna spoil the hell out of it.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.960]   I got some spoilers on Sunday from you
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.000]   because you joined us on Twit, which was great.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.560]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now we spent a lot of time talking about Apple,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.240]   but iOS 4.5 hadn't come at 14.5 hadn't come out yet,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.120]   so we have something to talk about today as well.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   Andy Inako is also here, WJBH Boston.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   Hello.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.280]   Everybody's 720P.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.120]   I feel like you're right here with me today.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.400]   I love that.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.280]   Only I'm only moving at 30 frames per second.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.240]   Yeah, but in real life, I'm low energy,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.640]   but I can go at least 60.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.560]   How, what is the frame rate of real life after all, really?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.880]   Somewhere around 400, I think.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.720]   Oh, really?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120]   Somebody figured that out?
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.880]   I actually had to look it up about a couple months ago,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   and the theory is that if you get close to 400,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   the brain is not gonna be able to tell
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.960]   between frame rate and real life.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.840]   That's how fast you gotta go.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.280]   Yeah, it's that same thing about what is a retina display.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.720]   It's a display you can't see the dots.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.880]   So what is that?
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.160]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.840]   Also with this, Alex Lindsey from the Office Hours show
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.040]   at 10.0.media.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.560]   Good to see you.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   Good to see you.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.360]   Thanks to Alex, we were able to get our Skype,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   our Zoom representative to upgrade us to 720p.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Now he says, the next step is what I've got, 1080p.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.760]   But then--
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.600]   That's where it's all out.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.440]   That's where it's all out.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.800]   Then we realize, Leo's on a 1080i camera,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.080]   which means effectively I'm 540.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.760]   So y'all look better than I do.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.840]   Doesn't seem right, some.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.360]   Hey, I think you always wanna turn it all the way up
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   as far as it goes, that's all that's all.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.160]   You're gonna get some reds.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.240]   Just some weapon, monstros sensors in there.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.080]   Yes.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.320]   Oh, goodness gracious.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.000]   14.5 came out yesterday.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   A great excitement was heard throughout the land.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.040]   It's a jolly good update for it.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.080]   It's a jolly good update.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.680]   Everywhere except in the halls of Facebook,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.360]   this is the one they were worried about.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.440]   So what happened, at least from ad tracking,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.880]   what happened in 14.5?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.120]   Oh, they invented this thing called Inform and Consent,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.040]   where now you can't just really nilly stock people
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.480]   in digital space, the same way you can't really nilly
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.320]   stock us in physical space.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.400]   You have to say, would you like us?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.440]   Is it okay if we follow you around the inner web?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.560]   We'll give you these benefits.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.280]   We'll tell you all the benefits we'll give you,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   but you have to press that little button to say it's okay.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.960]   And Facebook is upset because I think people won't press it.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.800]   Right.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.000]   Yeah, 'cause, well, and this is like one of those things
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.480]   that Facebook should have just let go,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.360]   because this is the place where, you know,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.040]   you don't wanna see how the sausage gets made,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.840]   and the more they talk about it,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.160]   and the more that they fight it,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.520]   the more they're opening up,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.480]   this is all the stuff in your sausage.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.720]   And this is what this looks like,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.840]   and I think that it could single-handedly,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.080]   them going into this and pulling this open,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.280]   could destroy advertising on the web as we know it,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.520]   because people are gonna get super sensitive
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   when they realize how deep this is gone.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   You know, and so the thing is,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.560]   most of us have been happy not knowing exactly
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.040]   how much we're being tracked.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.840]   And as they keep on picking at this and pulling it out,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.240]   you know, I think that they should have just left this alone.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.440]   You know, but it's gonna be cool.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   I didn't say anything.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   And they just quite a bit of it.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.040]   Yeah, Google was like, we're not, yeah.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.880]   Yeah, Google was like, we're not saying anything about this.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.640]   We don't want anyone being thinking about this.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.160]   We're fine. We're fine.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.360]   I think it's because they're also in the phone business
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.440]   and they also, the phone operating system business.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.840]   So they know that if the public is turning this way,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.640]   then they have to turn this way as well.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.480]   That's true. That's a good point.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.160]   And thirdly, Facebook made absolutely the worst response
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.000]   to this.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.440]   The right way to do this is to say nothing.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.960]   And then when people start complaining about,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.880]   oh, well, how come like Facebook doesn't work anymore?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.400]   It's only giving me like straight news or whatever.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.520]   They say, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.440]   Well, Apple, oh, you must have updated a 14 point.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.000]   Okay. Apple hasn't introduced some stuff
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.600]   that makes things not work on Facebook anymore.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.200]   But if you go here and turn this off
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   or turn this on, it'll work again.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.960]   'Cause I think most people think,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   remember the time when every Sunday,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.680]   every single website starts as having a pop up
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680]   or a little bar saying, here's what we're doing
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.000]   with cookies and you have to accept.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.640]   And nobody even reads that anymore.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.280]   They just simply say, oh,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.240]   if I click this button, I get to read this thing
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   that I want to read. Great. I'll click this button.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.960]   With Facebook, if you want to see cute new videos
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   of your aunt's cat or your niece's new kid,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.080]   you're going to click that button.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.160]   So Facebook, I was trying to say,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.360]   we're defending the world.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.520]   We're defending all of small business against Apple's tyranny.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   Everybody smells that as BS of all they did was say that,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.360]   oh, the service that you know and love is not working anymore
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.120]   because of something Apple did.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.160]   Just click this button and your problems will go away.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   That's how you do it. That's how you be evil.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.320]   - It's kind of a version of the Streisand effect, isn't it?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.200]   You make enough noise, everybody pays attention
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120]   and maybe that didn't look so good.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.960]   - No longer.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.440]   - Right.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.320]   Joanna Stern said, here comes pop up Alooza.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.920]   Pop up Alooza.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.400]   But I haven't seen any pop ups yet.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.320]   Why not?
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.600]   Am I gonna?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.440]   - Are you up?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.720]   - Are you updated? - Yeah.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.240]   - So you're seeing them every time you watch them.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   Every time you launch an app, you're seeing them.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.760]   - If the app was doing that. - Oh, I deleted
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.160]   one of those apps a while ago.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.040]   - Maybe that's why.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.920]   I don't have Facebook, Instagram or what's app on my phone.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.360]   - You could install it just for the giggles,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.560]   just to say, just to die at one time and then delete it.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.800]   - And then there's another question.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.480]   And let me show you, if I go into the privacy settings
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.640]   on my iPhone, now that I'm in 14.5,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.440]   there's a tracking section and there's a button that says,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.960]   allow apps to request to track.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.880]   - So you can choose your default state.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   You can have it set to nothing contract
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.120]   and then go in and individually turn on the ones
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   that you think it's okay if they track you
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.320]   or you can have it set to everything contract
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520]   and then you'll get that pop up
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.440]   or you can go through and individually select the ones
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.560]   you don't wanna track you.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.160]   - So, okay, so, and then--
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.120]   - That's the general, yeah, the general setting.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.520]   - So, if I turn, it's a little confusing.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.040]   If I turn allow apps to request to track,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.760]   it's not the same as turning off tracking.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   - It's just turning off the pop up.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.000]   - Effectively it is.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.960]   They can't ask you any, well, it means they can't,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.360]   they can't track you and they can't ask to track you.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   - Ah, so this is, if you don't like tracking,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.960]   turn that off.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800]   - Yes.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.360]   - And then do you want to ask apps you previously allowed
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.200]   to track, ah, here's the setting I didn't see.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.280]   If you wanna ask apps you previously said, okay,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   you can track to stop tracking
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.320]   and then you can choose to allow them to continue
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.840]   or just say, no, stop.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   By the way, I noticed, it's very polite.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.200]   It says ask apps to stop.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.720]   - Is that because it's not enforced?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.840]   - It's both, so they can enforce it
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.200]   for the on device ad identifying token.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.640]   So the IDFA, Apple controls that, they can enforce it.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.120]   But a lot of companies like Google and Facebook
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.640]   have their own technology, like their own cookie systems,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   their own identifier systems that don't run through iOS.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.960]   - So all this does turn off IDFA, the Apple ID for it.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.480]   - Yeah, and Apple asks that they honor your choice
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.720]   and that it's a matter of policy that they honor your choice,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.080]   but we'll see what the real world.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.760]   - So there is a thing in your browser call, do not track.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   And the experience we have had now is you can turn it on,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   but nothing more.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.120]   - I think we'll change.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.360]   - It is not honored.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.800]   - 'Cause it's an honor system.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   And then they said, no, I'm not gonna honor it.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.680]   And there's no honor among thieves.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.600]   This is why it's a much bigger problem than what,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.940]   even Apple, I think Apple's doing wonderful work
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.320]   here, they really are doing yeoman's work
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   on behalf of the user.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.280]   The thing I hope doesn't happen is that people don't think,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.680]   oh, well, great, I just turned off this really great feature
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.760]   that Apple built for me.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.320]   And now I'm safe on the internet.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.920]   And well, no, because it's not just Google and Facebook,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.760]   the real evildoers are the ones that are smart enough not
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.720]   to put their heads above water.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.280]   They're the advertising and tracking companies
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.200]   and data collation companies that will do anything
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.220]   and everything to identify and earmark your device
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.900]   so that it can attach your specific ID to anonymize data.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.940]   That's the real risk to privacy and security in my opinion.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.100]   This is a great step forward.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.860]   I still want people to think that,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.060]   oh, just because I've activated this,
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.180]   I've suddenly, ha ha ha, nobody, I'm invisible.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.380]   I'm as stealthy as the shadow himself.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.340]   Well, no, it's one step and part of a balanced breakfast
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.180]   about your own privacy and security.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.360]   - Well, and I think that also Apple is boiling this frog slowly.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.880]   You know, so this is not the end of how this turns out.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.420]   I think Apple is. - It's just the beginning.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.440]   - They're just slowly tightening these things,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.880]   fighting a little fight with Facebook,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.720]   then they'll keep tightening.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.160]   Apple has no, they have no need to support advertising.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.920]   They have no need to help them.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.200]   And so, and nobody really likes them.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.560]   And so the issue is, is they're kind of in a place
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.280]   where they can keep on pushing down this path
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   as long as they don't do it too suddenly.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.340]   And they're gonna be able to wipe out lots of data,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.860]   you know, on the way there with location services
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.700]   with those other things.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.500]   And taking on ads are easy because no one wants to see them.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.180]   - There's a little, I disagree.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.420]   - Go ahead. - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.940]   I'm like, I'll make this quick.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.580]   I really like your analogy to the boiling,
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.420]   the frog analogy,
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.740]   because I think that they're gonna keep increasingly heat
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.900]   up until the point at which it starts to hurt Apple.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.580]   So I do think there's a point at which all these companies say,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.860]   well, look, there's a reason why Google Maps is free.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.780]   There's a reason why Twitter is free.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.700]   That's because we make money from ads.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.340]   We're not charging people five bucks a month to use this.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.460]   If at some point, I think that Apple is making it important
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.500]   for them to update their thinking,
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.960]   to think that no, that this is no longer the Wild West anymore.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.080]   You can't just simply take any data that you want
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.200]   under any circumstances without telling the user.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.040]   However, if Apple makes it so difficult for them
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   to create a profitable business that supports the iPhone,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.920]   they're just gonna simply make it so hard to use
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   for these users,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.040]   unless they turn off the features that are in convenience
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.760]   or incompatible with their model,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.240]   that now this, again, this becomes,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.200]   "Oh, well, Apple makes it such a pain in the butt
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.960]   to do anything that we want to do with these devices
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.840]   that, you know what?
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.560]   I'm just gonna turn off these features entirely,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.360]   where I'm gonna switch to another platform
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.120]   that doesn't keep hassling me each and every time
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   I wanna share a photo with somebody."
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.040]   - I don't think the hassling for a photo is one thing,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   but I think that obviously it's a pretty good model
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.040]   if you were in a subscription business to defeat advertising.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   - Well, that's, again, how many of these,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.200]   how many of the services that people really use
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.560]   are based on a subscription model?
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.440]   It's not all Netflix, it's not all Hulu.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   It's often, again, the Google Doc Suite, the Work Suite
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.000]   is, became such an important part
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.880]   of the ecosystem of the internet.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   Google Mail became such an important part
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.080]   of the ecosystem of the internet
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.280]   because it means that you don't have to pay five bucks,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.920]   10 bucks a month to get access to mail.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.680]   The big, once again, the thing that always comes
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.120]   to my mind is every time I go and work in the library
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.920]   and I see people working at computers in the library,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   they're not using subscription services.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.280]   If they had their own internet service,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.760]   if they could afford their own computers,
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.880]   they wouldn't be using PCs in the library.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.640]   And so they need to have Gmail,
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.880]   they need to have Google Docs
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.280]   or else they can't communicate with the outside world.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.720]   >> No, and not always be available,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   it may not be Apple's business model, that's all.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   I mean, the thing is, is that there's an enormous number
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.040]   of people who are a growing number of people
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   that are buying their way out of apps.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   You know, they're buying their way out of that process
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.080]   and they are pretty valuable to the advertising market
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.600]   because they're spending a lot of money.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.560]   But they're like, you know, like I almost never seen it,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.400]   ever.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.920]   You know, like, and it's like--
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.360]   >> That's our privilege, we can afford to do that.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.320]   >> Oh no, I'm not saying that it should go away
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.240]   all over the world, I'm just saying that Apple may choose
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   but that's not their business.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.400]   You know, like BMW doesn't try to get to certain markets,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.880]   Apple may not try either.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.440]   >> Yeah, all I'm saying is this will be my last,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.920]   I know this could be another half hour
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.160]   really great conversation.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.600]   All I'm saying is that Apple can't completely lock down
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.200]   their devices against tracking,
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.800]   it's against the technologies that advertisers require
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.840]   in order to keep these services running.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.160]   There will be a point at which it gets too hot
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.000]   for the frog and the frog is the user who simply says,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.520]   just like on the iPad, it's such a pain in the butt
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.800]   used to be to get a document of your own choosing
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.200]   onto this device that kind of stymied a lot of people's
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.800]   ability to use the iPad as a serious computer.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.440]   And now Apple has sort of weakened that a little bit
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.520]   to make sure that it's still not an open file system
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.320]   but it's easier to get stuff on there.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.040]   There's a line at which you can't cross
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.360]   if you want to continue to attract people
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.280]   in a competitive marketplace.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.800]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   >> I mean-- >> You know the snarky comments
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.960]   between Tim and Mark, Leo?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   >> Yes. >> Tell me about that.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.760]   Oh, yeah, so Tim and Mark apparently had a meeting
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.720]   because I think it was in New York Times and Mark asked him--
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   >> But these are the best questions.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.320]   >> What am I supposed to do with all this data
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.520]   that we've been accumulating outside the Facebook app
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.040]   and Tim said delete it.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.760]   >> Wow. >> Yeah, that's the right--
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.480]   >> And Mark is-- >> Mark is right.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.760]   >> But that is really-- >> That was really happy.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.720]   >> That really happened. >> That really happened.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.440]   >> Yeah, right after the Cambridge Analytica scandal,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.920]   according to this New York Times story,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.480]   there was sort-- they were at some sort of like
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.720]   billionaires who ruled the world conference.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.360]   And there was some sort of like a private little--
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.920]   let's catch up, let's talk about like our businesses.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   And Mark was like--
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.960]   and I imagine him with a, oh well gosh,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   well we're two CEOs who respect each other
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.120]   and like each other and are on the same footing.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.040]   I'll say, well, what would you do if you're in this situation
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.320]   with Cambridge Analytica and he said,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.040]   I would delete all the data that we have on everybody.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   >> This is the New York Times says,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.600]   Mr. Zuckerberg was stunned.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.680]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.440]   >> Facebook-- >> Stunned, I say.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.040]   >> Said the people who were not authorized to speak publicly.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.600]   Facebook depends on data about its users
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.280]   to target them with online ads and to make money.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.760]   By urging Facebook to stop gathering that information,
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.520]   remember Cook just said,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.960]   don't gather information about people who aren't on using Facebook.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.880]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.640]   >> Not that people were using Facebook,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   just the stuff outside of Facebook.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.920]   >> The data collected by the app itself.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.720]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.800]   >> Mr. Cook was in effect telling Mr. Zuckerberg
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.960]   his business was untenable.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.240]   And then I love this, he ignored Mr. Cook's advice.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   >> Well, and remember that Facebook and other companies
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.160]   are trading data and also acquiring massive amounts of data
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.720]   outside of the app that aren't related to your phone as well.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.400]   So they're fully named-- >> That's what
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.000]   but the shit bothers me is the so-called shadow dasies.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.800]   >> So because I don't have a Facebook account,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.520]   but they're still gathering information about me
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.560]   whenever you tell me, well, they're not because I block it.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   But if I didn't block it actively,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.000]   they'd be gathering information every time I went to a page
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.840]   with a like button or a Facebook button.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.680]   >> It's not even that.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.640]   They're buying your box for your sources.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.680]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.960]   >> Like what you buy this. >> You know, so they're all the brokers
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.040]   doing that too, by the way.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.120]   I should point out, Google announced that they would be able
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.320]   to tell advertisers when somebody saw a Google ad on a page
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.800]   and then made a purchase and people said,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.080]   "Well, how would Google know that?"
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.160]   Well, they're collecting the credit card information.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.960]   That's how they're-- >> Well, not only that,
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.000]   they know where you are.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.720]   So the thing is is that they know where you are
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.200]   and then they can-- >> And then they see
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.360]   the credit card charge. >> Connect the account
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   and the credit card to the location,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.160]   and then they connect it to everything
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.880]   that you bought at Safeway, and then they have
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   all that information involved. >> What's interesting is
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.160]   neither Zuckerberg nor Google, they're kind of tone deaf
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.240]   about this, that this surprises them,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.840]   that this would bother anybody.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.360]   >> Well, I think that it's from a culture of deciding that
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.480]   privacy is not something that is even possible anymore.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.320]   I mean, we've heard people say that for the last year.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.840]   >> The younger people think that, yeah.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.080]   >> Just think you should just give that up,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.040]   and privacy is not something that really is going to be part
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.320]   of the future. >> It might be right.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.720]   >> Yeah. >> And it may be, but that is the,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.560]   I think the fundamental change, but the difference
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.800]   between the companies that are gathering all is like,
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.480]   well, that's a vestige of the past,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.760]   whereas Apple saying, well, maybe not.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.600]   (laughing)
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   It's the vestige of the future.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.560]   So I think that there's, but those are two very
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.720]   philosophical differences, and they see it as creating
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.040]   services and providing things to Andy's point,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.680]   to people who can't afford those services.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.920]   And also, it is valid that if you're a small company
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.960]   and you wanna sell things on the internet,
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.440]   there is nowhere that's more efficient than Facebook
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.360]   to get the word out to you. >> Well, and not just companies.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.240]   >> Just a small number of people that might be interested
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.720]   in what you're doing. >> Politicians, too.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.680]   And Jeff Jarvis made this, and I think it was a salient point.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.560]   If you're a big-shot politician, you've got the money
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.920]   to buy TV and stuff.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.400]   But if you're a small politician running for city council,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.920]   Facebook is the best way to reach those perspective voters,
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.460]   effectively, efficiently.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:17.720]   You know, we had Philip Elmer DeWitt on Sunday,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.880]   Renee was there, and Philip is on the city council of,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.480]   I think it's Greenfield, Massachusetts,
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.640]   a little town of Massachusetts.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.600]   He said, thanks to Facebook, the towns
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.680]   and people are fighting with each other.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.840]   That's the other thing that happens.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.960]   But I think that might just be because now they can hear
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.400]   what the other people say and think.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.160]   >> Well, the problem is that--
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.560]   >> It's also trans-Facebook. >> That's also trans-Facebook.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.040]   >> That they've made, sorry.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.440]   >> Well, I was gonna say that the thing is,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.480]   is that because Facebook can target you so carefully,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.440]   they can stir you up without anybody else seeing you,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.000]   because they're gonna find people that are like-minded
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.240]   to that ad and then give them information
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   that they tangentially agree with
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.800]   or more likely to believe without anybody else seeing it
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.360]   arguing with it, they just get this pure feed
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.240]   of what you think is happening, is actually happening.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   And that I think is also increasing the issues.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.960]   >> Further in the New York Times article,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.680]   it says, talking about Zuckerberg and Cook,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.120]   the executives have also jabbed at each other in 2017.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.080]   This is, I remember when this happened, I was appalled.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.320]   A Washington political firm funded by Facebook
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.960]   and other Apple rivals published
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.640]   anonymous articles criticizing Cook
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.160]   and creating, this is really dirty tricks,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.040]   creating a false campaign to draft him
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   as a presidential candidate, presumably the up end
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.680]   his relationship with former President Trump
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.880]   was famously sensitive to that kind of thing.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.400]   (laughing)
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.480]   I mean, that's-
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.320]   >> That's terrible.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.760]   >> That's worthy of a Romulan.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.080]   That is a really good idea.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.920]   >> Oh boy.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.880]   >> Ferengi style.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.200]   And when Mr. Cook was asked by MSNBC in 2018,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.120]   I love this one, how you would deal with Facebook's privacy issues
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.400]   if he were in Mr. Zuckerberg's shoes,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.720]   he replied, "I wouldn't be in this situation."
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.560]   (laughing)
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.400]   >> We should also say-
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.520]   >> We should also say Apple and Facebook declined
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.360]   to make Mr. Cook and Mr. Zuckerberg available
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   for interviews and said,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.400]   "The men have no personal animosity toward each other."
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.240]   Period.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.080]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.920]   >> Popeye and Bluto.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.360]   >> We have testimony that like,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.320]   from countless Facebook executives now that have said,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.780]   "On record that every time they've given
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.480]   "Mark Zuckerberg the opportunity
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.080]   "to choose slightly less toxic paths,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.300]   "like they could reduce the amount of conspiracy theory
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   "and extremism by 20% and revenue would go down like 5%.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.700]   "All those kinds of choices,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.320]   "he has chosen to maximize revenue and engagement every time."
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   And he's also in a unique position,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.880]   unlike Google and other companies,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.800]   where he's not responsible to his board.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.680]   He's set everything up so that he has
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   complete like potentate powers over Facebook.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.000]   And I think that'll be to the detriment of him eventually
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.020]   because nothing unregulated internally
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.800]   ends up being unregulated externally.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.640]   >> We have figured it out.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.840]   The chatroom, thank you very much.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.440]   We figured it out from ours, Technica.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.120]   Cable chewing beavers take out town's internet.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.160]   (laughing)
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.500]   In uniquely Canadian outage.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.160]   So-
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.000]   >> Those darn beavers.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.320]   >> Those darn beavers.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.640]   That's the problem.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.480]   >> Have our knock.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.600]   >> Blame the beavers.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.160]   They're building a dam with your internet cables.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.000]   So I have a question,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.160]   and this was nine to five Mac said they found this.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.160]   There are some users for whom this button
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.640]   I just showed the allowed apps,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.240]   allow apps to request a track is grayed out.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.400]   And if it is grayed out,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   it doesn't look like there's any obvious way to un-gray out.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   >> What I find is with mine,
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.760]   I don't have all the extra features.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.600]   If I turn that off,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.400]   I don't see the extra features that you saw.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.200]   I only get to turn it on and off.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.040]   Allow.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.320]   >> So you don't get that like,
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.800]   oh, you know why I got that?
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.080]   Because I had somehow,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.920]   without my knowledge,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.960]   it just must have been pre-14,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.000]   five given three apps permission to track.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.840]   >> Oh, God.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.880]   >> And permission to track outside the app,
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.960]   which of course no one would want.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.280]   And so that was what that pop up was.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.880]   You know, these guys are going to get turned off
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.280]   or you want to leave them on.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.120]   So you didn't get that because of that.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   >> Right.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.240]   >> I have zero as well because I never did that either.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.720]   >> Yeah, Apple says-
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.280]   >> It's a big blank screen.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.840]   >> Apple says that they think it,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.440]   or you will see that grayed out
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.480]   if there are two possibilities
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.560]   and I don't think that this covers all the people
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.240]   who have a grayed out.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.600]   If you're under the age of 18,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.120]   it'll be grayed out because it's just on,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.480]   tracking is blocked by default if you're under 18,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.600]   apparently.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.440]   Or if your device has an MDM profile
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.200]   that restricts allow apps to request to track settings,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.600]   the kind of thing your business might have put on your phone
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.400]   to prevent that.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.360]   But nine to five says,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.720]   but the people we're hearing from are not
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.960]   in those situations.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.360]   So don't know why that's happening,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.520]   but that's maybe a bug, I would guess.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.000]   >> Do you want to watch Apple's two minute explanation
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   of all this?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   >> Mm.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.840]   >> No?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.680]   (laughing)
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.520]   >> Is that a no, I'm saying-
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.600]   >> No, I watched it yesterday.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.840]   I thought it was a good explainer,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.560]   but like it's a little bit partisan
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.800]   about the reasons why companies track you.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.880]   So, I'll just keep that in mind.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.600]   >> When you're using apps on your iPhone,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.760]   you may start to see this.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.160]   It's the new app tracking transparency prompt.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.800]   It's a feature that gives you a choice.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.960]   A choice on how apps use and share your data.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.480]   Data like your age, location, health information-
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.880]   >> Oh, you're on the toilet.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.160]   >> And you're browsing history to name a few.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.880]   This data can help to map your runs,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.480]   to protect your photos, or track your location
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.880]   so a nearby store can offer discounts.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.040]   But some apps have trackers embedded in them
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   that are taking more data than they need.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.880]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.200]   >> Sharing it with third parties,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.800]   that's advertisers and data brokers.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.480]   They collect thousands of pieces of information about you
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   to create a digital profile that they sell to others.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.720]   >> That's a lot like your fingerprint.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.520]   >> These third parties use your profile
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.000]   to target you with ads.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.080]   And they can also use it to predict
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.600]   and influence your behaviors and decisions.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.360]   This has been happening without your knowledge or permission.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.080]   Your information is for sale.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.560]   You have become the product.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.960]   That's why iPhone users will now be asked
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.320]   a single simple question.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.680]   Allow apps to track you or not.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.760]   Maybe you're okay giving an app your email or a patient.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.600]   >> Maybe there's something wrong with you.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.800]   >> So you can share your data with others,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.400]   to personalize ads or build a profile about you.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.240]   >> Why?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.080]   >> You would be one.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.280]   >> And if you're not, well, that's what the prompt is for.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.440]   Whatever you choose is up to you.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.280]   >> It is a little.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   >> But an Apple, we believe that you should have a choice.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.240]   App tracking tracking.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.600]   >> It is a little slanted towards.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.640]   >> A simple new feature.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.480]   >> Why would anyone ever allow an app to track?
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.360]   >> Hey, if you want to--
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.040]   >> Is that a Laurie Gilchob?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.640]   >> Is that a Laurie Gilchob?
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.480]   >> Oh!
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.640]   >> It just feels like, I don't know.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.480]   It feels like a, it feels like, as you should say at the end,
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   it's like, yeah, do what you want.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.320]   It's your funeral.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.560]   (laughing)
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.000]   >> That's what I feel like.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.840]   >> It's your funeral.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.600]   >> That's not how your father and I raised you.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   >> Exactly.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.640]   >> We have to make your own mistakes.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.440]   >> It would be really disappointed if you go down that path.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.880]   But I mean, it's your life.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.240]   >> Can we say, you know, we gave you the chance.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.920]   Now, there's one thing,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   and I read this in one place,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.800]   and maybe it's bogus.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.080]   But Apple does still have some advertising, right?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.000]   >> Oh, is that the Wall Street Journal?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   That was the worst article.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.840]   >> It was probably the journal.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.160]   And they also have some sort of user segmentation thing
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.880]   that they offer advertisers to, right?
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.600]   Something like Google's Flock, where it's anonymized,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.640]   you know, different-- >> But I believe it's all
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   within the app.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.240]   >> It's, they're not saying you can't track any of it.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.080]   >> It's first party.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.920]   >> It's first party.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.760]   >> First party, got it.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.040]   >> Yeah, which they're letting everybody do.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.680]   >> Yeah, Facebook doesn't have to ask you if it doesn't,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.160]   if you're in the app, or no.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.440]   >> And the vast majority is the App Store recommending apps.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.400]   It's those App Store search ads that developers can buy,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.640]   which is not the kind of threat that a lot of the other--
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.040]   >> The Wall Street Journal article was terrible, though,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.640]   because it conflated all these things,
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.240]   and made it seem like Apple's doing this dirty trick.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.000]   And Apple delays giving some of the information
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.160]   to third parties from, like, the News app,
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.280]   and they do that deliberately
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.960]   so they can't get tracking data off of that.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.440]   And Apple doesn't track, so Apple has access to that data,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.040]   but it's also Apple's app.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.480]   It was a very, very strangely timed, strategized
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.960]   and executed article for me.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   >> Hmm.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.800]   >> I agree with this.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.960]   >> You know, the Journal of Late has been so anti-big tech,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.320]   it's starting to show through in the--
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.400]   you know, editorially, of course, they hate Google
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   because they feel like Google almost put them
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.120]   out of business, and I'm not sure why they would hate Apple,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.760]   but they certainly have kind of a little bit of a dog
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.080]   and they advertising tracking hunt.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.920]   >> It feels like Google should not be--
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.760]   >> It shouldn't be a lot of hate.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.600]   >> It's bleeding to the news.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.440]   >> It's a new operation.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.280]   That should be independent.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.600]   >> It actually seems like it kind of does.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.160]   They have a lot of writers that I really like in respects.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.000]   >> But then again, I don't--
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.200]   I only get it through Apple News,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.600]   so I'm not like watching--
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.440]   >> I pay.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.280]   >> I'm not ready to think over to cover.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.120]   >> I pay.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.440]   We win us during his ACEs.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.280]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.120]   >> I love that Joanna.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.480]   In fact, she has an interview with Apple.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.040]   >> It was so good.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.880]   >> Was it?
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   I didn't see it yet.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.560]   >> It was-- she goes right after it.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.360]   I was like, when are you going to be CEO?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.960]   What's happening with your hair?
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.000]   Tim, call you Hair Force One.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Things we really care about.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840]   >> Is it?
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.000]   >> No, not to my face.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   >> Oh, no.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.640]   >> So along with 14.5 for iOS and iPadOS,
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.040]   there's WatchOS 7.4.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.880]   And that adds--
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.280]   I think much needed-- it will unlock your phone
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.320]   if you've got a face mask on.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.080]   So yeah, it works with--
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.720]   it was a--
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.440]   sorry, I got kind of excited about this.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.480]   Nice start talking before I start thinking.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.240]   Watch us something.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.560]   I've got three post-it notes saying,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   please don't do that, Andy.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.640]   But yeah, I've seen demos of how it works.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.680]   And when you first start seeing, oh, well,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.480]   you'll let you unlock your phone with your watch.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.960]   That sounds a lot like what Android has done for a while,
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.000]   where you can have a trusted Bluetooth device nearby,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.480]   which is convenient, but it can be a security problem,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.320]   because it's very, very overtly trustworthy.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.160]   Whereas this is implemented specifically
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.640]   as a solution to the problem of,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.520]   I want the convenience of Face unlock
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.360]   without having to pull down my mask or create a brand new
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.760]   profile, and it works very, very well.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.120]   It's a very good Apple solution.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.520]   >> In fact, it kind of makes you wonder
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.680]   why they didn't do it sooner, because you have authenticated,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.880]   so that watch knows it's you.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.760]   I mean, it's hard because--
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.840]   no, it's a big info-sec problem for them,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.640]   because initially they made it so that the iPhone
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.600]   would unlock the Apple watch, thinking that it was just
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.160]   harder dexterously to use the passcode on the Apple watch,
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.400]   so make it easy, and whenever you unlock your iPhone,
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.560]   if you're wearing your Apple watch,
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.080]   it automatically unlocks, and they were really worried
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.840]   that there would be some sort of race condition
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.080]   or unforeseen event that would create an exploit
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.120]   between the Apple watch and the iPhone.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.680]   So they make an incredibly narrow
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.800]   when the conditions work, and they also have a bunch of--
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.280]   like if it gets unlocked and I walk away from you fast enough,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.560]   it'll lock again automatically, thinking someone's trying
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.600]   to take advantage of it to steal your phone.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.560]   So it's got, in order to maintain both of them
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   unlocking each other, which is not a tenable security
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.760]   situation, really.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.960]   They had to be very careful in engineering it.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.880]   I mean, I use my Apple watch to give password permission
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.520]   on-- it unlocks my MacBook.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.880]   When I need a password, I can have the Apple watch just say,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.640]   OK, password, and you double click.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.080]   But that's one direction as well.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.560]   It's the two directions that makes it harder.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.480]   I see.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.080]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.920]   Because if they can both unlock the other,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.600]   I don't want to say it's a temporal paradox that will
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.520]   end the universe.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.600]   But it's a little--
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.440]   It's not a hit on it.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.040]   But it might.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.560]   It might.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.080]   It might.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.840]   They're crossing the beams.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.440]   It's always risky.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.200]   As usual, it's a challenge to find that balance point
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.640]   between let's make this--
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.440]   let's make security easy enough to use
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.800]   that everybody will use it because the moment that you make
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.200]   it a little bit inconvenient or start to screw up,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.440]   people don't think, oh, well, there's this one exception,
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.200]   which doesn't work well.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.800]   That'll turn off that feature entirely.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.680]   And forget they've turned it off.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.120]   So it's such a--
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.400]   I think they must get like sociology PhDs on board,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.040]   working at Apple to work on this to figure out
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.200]   how does the human brain kick back against being told to do
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.480]   something they don't want to do, even when it's for their own good.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.360]   All you have to do is follow me around the grocery store
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.440]   because I've got my watch--
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.640]   has my shopping list.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.920]   And I've got my mask on.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.400]   I can't take it off.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.240]   And I have to pass code my watch every five minutes
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.960]   to say what--
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.200]   And Lisa's got 18 Apple tags in you.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.120]   I mean, I hope you'll open your opening for the last 18 days.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.520]   Oh, you want to-- hey, by the way, you want a really interesting--
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.200]   we're going to take a break in a second.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.640]   We actually have ads today.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.040]   Thank you.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.840]   We're going to take a break and say,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.960]   but I just want a weird question that I thought
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.120]   was great on the radio show.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.760]   It's an Android question, so you'll pardon me for this.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.160]   But a guy calls up, says, I have a Moto G7.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.800]   Nice phone, I recommend it.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.320]   But every time I walk into an Albert sense or a Vons,
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.120]   it reboots.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.840]   It goes into a boot loop.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.960]   And my first thought, well, maybe it's
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   something to do with Wi-Fi pairing, turn off, put it in an airplane
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.840]   mode, see if that fixes it.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.240]   But then somebody in the chat was very smart and said,
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.000]   oh, you know what that is?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.600]   They're using beaconing in these stores.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   In fact, Simon Malls do the same thing.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.040]   And there's some sort of weird interaction
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   with the beaconing in that particular phone.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.840]   There's some bug and it's causing a boot loop.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.640]   The fix is, and it works, all the time, turn off Bluetooth.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.040]   And then the beaconing--
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.480]   it's just was the weirdest bug.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.560]   And I can imagine how frustrating that would be for somebody.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.760]   Does not happen with an iPhone, so I don't even know why I brought it up.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.160]   I just thought it was interesting.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   Obviously--
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.440]   That's anti-advertising.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.880]   You want to steal information from--
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.680]   you want to be a pickpocket.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.720]   So they don't even know when they lost their phone.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.440]   Yeah, that's exactly--
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.240]   You don't want to be a--
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.240]   --mugger.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.400]   And that's what they're mugging them.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.080]   Renee has a purple iPhone.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.360]   He has air tags.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.960]   Or unless you already sent him back.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.720]   No, they're here.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   OK, we're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.080]   Because he's actually been using these guys.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.200]   But everybody wants to send them out.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.440]   That's what we want all we want to know is the purple faster.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.800]   Or I want to know, do you have the AirMiz $450 tag?
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.120]   I don't believe that's even shipping yet.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.280]   Don't scare me, Leah.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   They don't sample those.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.240]   That's all-- that's all--
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:52.720]   LMS.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.400]   They don't-- Apple doesn't sample the LMS stuff.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.520]   You know, Apple does all this great stuff for consumers.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.560]   But then there's this one little thing like, oh,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.920]   and for this $30 location tracker,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.480]   we're going to sell a $450.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.800]   I think I told you I asked.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.080]   I'm like, what is all this stuff?
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.200]   And the LMS rep very politely--
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.360]   and they were dressed in a way that I still can't imagine.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   Like, it was like coming out of a movie.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.760]   It was like angles and things.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.160]   And they just said, like, almost patronizingly too.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.240]   They just said, there are people who pay for $25,000 flights,
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.040]   $25,000 hotel rooms, and $25,000 dresses.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   They wear once.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.800]   This for them is no amount of money, dear.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.040]   I just feel like it's not a good look for Apple.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.680]   This is like the $25,000 Apple.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.320]   They want rich people to buy the stuff.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.480]   They just want rich people to buy it.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.640]   They don't care.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.800]   It is part of my burden to have to speak to journalists
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   from time to time.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.640]   If they were able to make our money,
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.200]   they wouldn't be journalists.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.800]   They'd be manipulating opinion, not reporting.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.200]   They don't have a problem with their men selling these.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.960]   Just like there are lots of companies that sell this.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.240]   There's no reason why you couldn't sell an air tag.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.400]   I just don't understand why Apple is--
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.040]   I feel like it's a mistake for Apple to promote it, make it--
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.560]   It's niche.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.280]   Like, they have the sport, and they have the on-ass.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.960]   It's just to meet their customers where they are.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.800]   All right.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.000]   It's fun.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.480]   But I have to go to commercial that, yeah, over the past week,
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   I have had the hardest maturity battle going through my head
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.160]   because I have two equal and opposite forces of philosophy
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:26.360]   saying if people have that kind of money and it makes them happy,
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.440]   let people be happy, it doesn't affect you whatsoever.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.960]   And on the other side, I say, oh, my God, people have $600
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.560]   to spend on a luggage tag.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.280]   And what's with these people?
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.320]   Like, I was watching-- there was a video about--
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:47.600]   a $500 million house in LA or Malibu or whatever.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.640]   And they're giving this tour.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.240]   And it really is like a hotel attached to a mall
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.200]   as a private home.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.240]   I'm like, why do you leave?
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.160]   Like, a kitchen attached to every single room.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.400]   You have a dance club with an 800--
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.640]   why do you need a dance club inside your house?
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.080]   At least because you do that.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.880]   You have acreage.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.400]   The problem is that these Hermes tags are just $10 leather tags
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.840]   with the Hermes brand on it.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.400]   They're not magical.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.120]   It's just blatant rip off.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.560]   Well, even like the latest watch bands aren't even leather.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.240]   Every time I say this wrong, people get so mad at me,
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.200]   L. Mess.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.520]   They're fabric-- whoa, they're woven fabric.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.560]   And they're still like $300 because only L. Mess can weave fabric.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.080]   You are a Franco phone.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.920]   You can say Hermes correctly, all you want.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.400]   I'm going to say Hermes just because people
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.240]   don't know people about it.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.840]   I like annoying.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.240]   But then I say Guo Ming Chi correctly and they get so mad.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:44.720]   Oh, I know.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.320]   Now it's a traditional quo.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.520]   No, it's Guo Ming Chi.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.600]   Guo Ming Chi.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.240]   Yes.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.720]   People aren't happy.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.000]   You're a jungguo ren, jungguo schwa.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.560]   Jungguo.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.480]   Shwa.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.200]   Lisa and I went into an Hermes store once in Paris.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   We left quickly.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.960]   I showed it a bright view, but--
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.600]   Are you the one?
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:08.800]   Are you the one?
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.120]   SFO gate.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.280]   I want the watch store one.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.120]   I'm there at every flight.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   Yes.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.520]   Thank God you're here.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.240]   Thank God you're here.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.520]   One of the toilets in the employees loud just
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.760]   been running fast all day.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.600]   But please use the rear entrance.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.520]   I walked into--
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.600]   I walked into some watch store.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.120]   And I said, I need a chronograph that
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.400]   can do a digital time that is--
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.880]   I can set the two of them separately.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.680]   He goes, oh, yeah, this is the watch you need.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   There's only one in the store.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.200]   This is the watch of the Taghar or something.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.720]   How much is it?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.760]   These are $5,000.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.320]   I was like, I'm in the wrong store.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.880]   That was the cheapest watch.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.440]   I guarantee you.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.480]   Because watch the dip.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.240]   You can spend $150,000 on a tag store.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.280]   I'm in the wrong store.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.800]   I'm going to go now.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.960]   I had the pretty woman experience
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.880]   where I walked into coaches.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.320]   And I said, do you have the Apple Watch band?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.440]   And the person looked at me like I was carrying the plague.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:57.920]   Like, what?
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.160]   We don't have those.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.960]   And I held one up on my watch.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.640]   Because I had one of the early ones.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.680]   I'm like, yeah, you sell it now.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.960]   They're like, oh, and then the manager came back later,
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.840]   like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.800]   We have them in this and this.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.000]   Which ones would you like to get?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.760]   I was like, oh.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.200]   We don't sell--
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.120]   That changed quickly.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   We don't sell time expands.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:13.480]   So you--
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.360]   Until they saw the prices on those bands.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.560]   Fancy twist-o-flex bands.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.920]   I keep aspiring to own one day.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.400]   That's right.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.440]   It will not pinch or pull your arm here.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   That's the beauty.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.360]   Wow, this has been a real trip down to consumer lane.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.240]   The Rodeo Drive of my mind.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.280]   Our show today-- oh, we got a new Casper.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.080]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.280]   I don't know if we have a video of it.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.840]   I don't think we should have a video of it.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.720]   Our show today brought you by Casper.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.240]   I sleep on a Casper every night.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   We got a brand new one.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.200]   It's really nice.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.480]   I have owned--
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.000]   probably owned all the Casper.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.400]   See, I collect Casper mattresses.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.840]   What's great about Casper is everybody in my family
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.720]   also has Casper mattresses.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.240]   When my daughter moved just about two months ago,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.960]   she said, I don't have a mat, try to not have a bed.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.040]   I said, no problem.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.600]   Got the whole set.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.720]   From Casper, Casper has just announced something new,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.480]   the Casper cooling collection just in time for summer time.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.720]   Everything you need is sleep cool at night and all night long.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.120]   Casper mattresses with the new Snow technology,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.920]   hyper light sheets, lightweight duvets,
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.760]   and breathable mattress protector
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.960]   are all designed to keep you cool and comfortable,
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.680]   so you can't help but love you tomorrow.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.040]   Actually, we know sleeping cool is critical to a good night's
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.480]   sleep, believe it or not.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.560]   I think I fell asleep on my mattress.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.040]   These really do sleep cool.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.720]   I love our Caspers.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.200]   That is not feigned pleasure.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.600]   Casper's wave hybrid snow mattress keeps you cool--
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.000]   I love the name, the snow mattress.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   It keeps you cool for 12 plus hours,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.080]   pulling heat away from your body for sustained temperature
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.000]   regulation, a cool to touch feeling.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.760]   A better bedding makes for a better tomorrow.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.040]   That's why Casper's hyper light sheets
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.160]   are designed with an innovative grid weave
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.360]   that lets air flow through for maximum breathability.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.440]   It's time to dress your bed for summer.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.560]   Don't forget the lightweight duvets.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   It provides optimal temperature control
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.880]   without sacrificing plush comfort.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.640]   Even Sammy loves it.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.120]   Our little kitty cat.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.520]   Casper's breathable mattress protector
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.320]   improves the coolness of the bed even further
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.400]   by allowing air to flow between your body and your mattress.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.120]   I cannot stress this.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   And I know people think I'm crazy, but Micah knows.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.400]   He's a sleep expert.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.000]   Sleeping cool is very important.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.680]   All of these great mattress products
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.040]   designed to work together to prevent overheating all night
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.000]   long because cooler sleep means better sleep.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.680]   I don't even mean cold.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.160]   I mean, you know how when you turn the pillow over
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.040]   and it's cool and refreshing like that?
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.400]   Better sleep means better tomorrow's.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.240]   And as always, Casper offers free shipping and free returns.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.520]   When it comes to a better night's sleep,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.440]   Casper's new cooling collection has you covered.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.920]   Focus on tomorrow.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.520]   Let Casper handle the rest.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.480]   Explore Casper products, mattresses, sheets, pillows,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.160]   and more.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.600]   I got my daughter entire, basically entire bedroom set.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.680]   At Casper.com/MacBreak.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.040]   You can use a code MacBreak for $100 off-select mattresses.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.880]   The MacBreak gives you $100 off-select mattresses offer
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.600]   excludes the snow mattresses.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.280]   See Casper.com for more details.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   By the way, I mentioned new iPad and iOS, new WatchOS,
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.760]   but there's also no TVOS.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.320]   And Renee, I think this turns on the new calibration feature,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.680]   even on older Apple TVs.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.320]   If you have, which Apple TVs work with this?
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.680]   I believe it's 4K and 4K.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.600]   What are we calling it? 4K Mark II?
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   4K-Duh?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.280]   Duh?
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.040]   Yeah, I have.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.880]   4K, then you 4K?
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.760]   I have several generations, so I'll go around and try it and see.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.880]   Not the 1080p, 4K.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.120]   You need a 4K.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.680]   I think.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.480]   Yes, I believe.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.280]   I might be wrong about that, but I believe you need the 4K.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.200]   And what, how do I get it to start?
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.280]   So it really depends, like what you get of it and what it does,
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.880]   really depends on the television that you have,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.120]   you know, properly supporting it.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.240]   And all it can do, brightness and contrast,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.160]   those sorts of things, all it can do is the color accuracy
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.720]   of the display.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.000]   And it basically uses the sensors in your iPhone
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.600]   to calibrate the Apple TV.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   So the output from the Apple TV to your TV
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   gives you as accurate colors as possible.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.400]   Because again, they can't go in there
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.920]   and flip the dials on your TV set for you.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.480]   So it just basically adjusts the signal.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.440]   Yeah, we were talking with Scott Wilkinson
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.840]   on Saturday on the radio show, because I wanted to know what
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.360]   Scott thought.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.680]   He hasn't tried it yet.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.800]   But we do know that it can't, for instance,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.960]   adjust the brightness and contrast.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   Only, that has to go through the TV.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.040]   Yes.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.480]   The Apple TV can basically can only correct color.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.720]   And Scott was in the opinion, says, that's great.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.880]   It's nice.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.440]   But honestly, probably the most important thing you're
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   going to do with a brand new TV is adjust the brightness
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.360]   and contrast, because that's set for a store that's
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.960]   going to be vivid and pop.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.920]   And it's not natural.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.880]   And that's probably the most important thing to do.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.560]   The thing that I haven't done yet is--
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.160]   I did it yesterday, and it was great.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.680]   Really?
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.000]   Did you notice the difference?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.200]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.560]   The colors are definitely more accurate after I did it.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.800]   And my TV was pretty well set up,
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   but it definitely looked better when I was done.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   It didn't make a huge difference, because mine was already
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.400]   pretty close.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.520]   I have a-- it is a Samsung.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.800]   I'm trying to think of which-- which LCD.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.240]   Because I have a Visio, and it's LCD.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.520]   I haven't tried it with our LG.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.520]   We have an LG at the office that's pretty high-end.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.800]   I'm going to try that tonight.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.440]   Yeah, my LG OLED.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   I want to see-- I mean, presumably it'll work with an OLED,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.120]   because it's not changing the TV.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.840]   It's changing what the Apple TV sends to the TV.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.800]   So what it does is you go into your video settings,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.600]   and then go down to audio and video, and then go into video.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.320]   And it says calibrate.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.920]   And when you hit it, it just says--
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.320]   your phone comes up and says, do you want to start doing this?
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.480]   If they're on the same network, and you say yes.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.560]   And then it puts up a little place for you to put your phone.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.600]   And you turn your phone around, so the front-facing camera
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.440]   is in front of it.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.240]   And then you'll see it start changing colors.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.640]   So it'll go through the primaries,
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.320]   and then it goes through the whites, and so on and so forth.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.840]   And it kind of scrolls through those.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.200]   And then it makes this nice little explosion, where it goes,
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   oh, nice.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   All done.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.920]   And it's like, there's a classic Apple surprise in the light.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   And then we're going to make fireworks.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   You're done.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.080]   So it was-- anyway, so then it finishes.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.320]   And as soon as it came up, it definitely looked--
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.360]   what I want to do now is set the TV really badly,
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.640]   and then do it again, and see what happens,
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.680]   and then see it-- because it was already pretty close.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.080]   And so it definitely looked better.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   But I'm kind of curious how far the error correction can go.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.800]   So I haven't had time to set that up,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.440]   but I'm going to be doing that over this week.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.960]   I thought it was one of the most exciting announcements
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.040]   of the whole thing.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:12.880]   You know that it--
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.400]   Yes.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.280]   Because it was just--
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.800]   Well, this is such a problem for people.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.520]   I mean, even when we, as professionals,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:29.360]   buy a high-end OLED LG, getting that thing to look correct
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.440]   is like a day.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   [LAUGHS]
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.960]   Oh, I brought in Scott.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.640]   He's a THX certified calibrator.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.880]   And he spent several hours with special machinery.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.400]   Exactly.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   And the only way to get it really close
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.040]   is to use a LUT box that's going to let me really
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.080]   take control of that.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.000]   And so the idea that they're taking a lot of that
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.640]   that would normally cost us $1,015, $100 of hardware
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.280]   to solve that is pretty amazing.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   And so for the average person, just will it--
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.200]   people keep on asking me, is it going to be 100%?
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.360]   No, it's not going to be 100%, but it's
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   going to be four times better than what you had before,
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   which is going to be great.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.880]   So Gallifrey Rebel in our IRC says,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.320]   it works with the HD version as well.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.000]   So does John the Jam.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.200]   Yeah, that's not what Apple implied,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   but apparently it does.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.040]   Gallifrey Rebel said, I have two of them,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.760]   and I was able to color calibrate.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.800]   My colors look warmer now.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.120]   They were kind of washed out before, but I didn't know it.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.360]   So that does make a difference.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.160]   One thing that was on 9-5 back--
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.320]   because I haven't had time to test it on a vision display,
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.960]   but they were like, oh, it doesn't work with vision,
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.920]   because vision already does that.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.360]   But vision doesn't have a way to sample that color.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.480]   Oh.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.320]   So I'm not sure--
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.120]   Yeah, that's what Wrigley's saying in the chatroom.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.560]   I tried the new Apple calibration,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.800]   but if you have Dolby Picture mode on your TV
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.440]   and it's set on Apple as Dolby, it says, no need to do this.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.920]   But you're saying it's not really--
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.200]   You still don't have a sample?
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.160]   Well, I don't know if it can.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.200]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.040]   Dolby may override whatever your--
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.400]   It's color managed, right?
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.120]   So Dolby may say in their license agreement--
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.920]   and by the way, Apple, if you're going to say Dolby,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.840]   you can't mess with it, right?
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.400]   But the problem is that it doesn't know what--
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.520]   theoretically it does, but being able to really know
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.240]   what that TV is doing is something
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.960]   that a center would be useful for.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.600]   It uses the face ID sensors, right?
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.400]   So your phone has to have a face ID or it won't work, right?
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.000]   I think so, you know.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.440]   Cool.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.080]   I'm going to go home and try it tonight.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.280]   I have three Apple TVs.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:45.960]   By the way, on Sunday, Philip Belmer-Dowitt talked about--
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.760]   we were talking about the new Apple remote.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.800]   And he said, oh, all you really need to do
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.360]   is buy these little rubber holders.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.880]   Makes your Apple remote usable again.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.800]   So during the show, I bought three of them, and he's right.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.880]   He's absolutely right.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.200]   Let me see if I can find him.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.160]   They're from that Elago company we love so much that
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.080]   makes the little rubber iMac that you put your Apple watch
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.680]   into charge it.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.480]   And there-- oh, actually it was no.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.400]   It's Dwight Silverman.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.360]   Sorry.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   Sorry, Dwight.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.800]   Of course, on.forms.com--
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.840]   But do they come in purple?
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.720]   Sush, Dwight.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.120]   I want to--
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.320]   Well, I got the ones in black.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:33.400]   And Lisa said-- she said, oh, they're also magnetic.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.280]   Dwight Silverman was the guy.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.760]   He says, no, the original serial remote doesn't suck
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.680]   if you do this.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.120]   It does solve some of the problems, but not all.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.880]   They still got that Siri button on the front there
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.360]   where I hit it every time.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.440]   And there's no mute.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.280]   And there's no TV on switch.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.440]   I think that-- I don't know.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:53.040]   I love it enough to spend 60 bucks to retrofit my older Apple
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.960]   TVs.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.840]   That's the difference.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.560]   Maybe if it had an Hermes holder.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.640]   $500.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.240]   My son just uses his game controller.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.680]   Like, he doesn't even use the mode.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.760]   He just picks up his game because he plays a lot of Apple TV.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.120]   And he's used to it.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.800]   And his thumbs are--
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.280]   His thumbs are overdeveloped.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.680]   I will say that the game controller is a little bigger,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.840]   but it's a lot faster than the remote to get around.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:21.680]   With the release of all of those, there's a new big sir.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.160]   11.3.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.480]   It'll show up in your update.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.160]   If it hasn't already, it will soon.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.560]   It-- a variety of new features for the Reminders app, Apple
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:38.600]   Music, HomePods support, M1 optimizations, AirTags.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.040]   I realized all of these had to be updated for AirTags.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   And there is a malware fix.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.160]   There's a security fix as well.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.720]   So look for 11.3.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.000]   Have you done it, anybody?
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.960]   Has anybody done it yet?
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.480]   Not me.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.840]   No, me neither.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.040]   It's too bad that they haven't made AirTags compatible with.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.440]   You can't set up an AirTag with a Mac.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.120]   I know.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.520]   Because it's got the Find My app.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.440]   It's got everything else you need.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.360]   It's kind of a bummer.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.880]   I understand why they're making it iPhone--
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.320]   Is there a technical reason?
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.720]   Is it Bluetooth LE or something?
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.120]   It's got all the sensors.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.240]   I think Apple is just still in a state
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.040]   where the Mac lags in several things for a release or two,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.400]   which is--
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.160]   It's getting better.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.240]   It's way better than it used to be,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.680]   but it's still not day in date for a lot of these services.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.000]   Because I hope that if it were a multi-platform in any way,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.360]   boy, it would be so hard to recommend anything
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.560]   other than the Apple Tag.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.240]   And until a year from now, when Tyle and everybody else comes up
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.800]   with the same sort of privacy portfolio and security
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.520]   portfolio that Apple had at day one, that's a really
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.600]   compelling story that they're making.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.680]   You have to set it up with an iPhone and iPad,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.280]   but once you set it up, you can use it with AirTag.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.320]   Yeah, that's what it says.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.400]   It's still fine with my works everywhere.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.640]   You can set it up with an iPad?
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.040]   Oh.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.560]   Oh.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:00.880]   OK.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.800]   I don't know if that works.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.720]   iPhone only.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   So let's talk about the AirTags.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.080]   Renee has one.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   How many do you have?
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.120]   Two?
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.200]   I have five.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.880]   I have the four pack and the one-- the one shot
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   and the four shots.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   Oh.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   They're dead.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.480]   Nice.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.040]   Very nice.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   So--
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.280]   Did you get them engraved?
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:19.780]   No.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.840]   So these are all demos.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.320]   These are the ones that Apple sent.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.280]   So this is a funny story, and I hope you'll forgive me
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:24.680]   saying this.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.840]   Actually, I think he said it already.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.640]   But one of them says JG on it.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.840]   I don't know if you can see that.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.200]   And I think when Gruber got his, he assumed it was for John
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.920]   Gruber, not realizing we all got JG.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.480]   What does JG stand for?
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.200]   Apple just randomly picked and there's JG and there's RJT.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.760]   And I think Apple's just showing off
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.000]   that you can have them engraved.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.920]   I get it.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.680]   Either or someone at Apple has a really good sense of humor.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.160]   I don't know, either way.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.640]   I think it's John Gruber's world.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.560]   We just live in it.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.760]   I think it's JG.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.280]   It is.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.920]   It's your all John Gruber's.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.120]   And who is RJT?
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.440]   I think Robert J. Troutheimer.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.200]   Who is RJ?
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.080]   I don't know.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.840]   It's all Robert Downey Jr. to me.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.520]   Robert Junie Downey, RJT.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.400]   Ring joint type, Rubicon Japan trust.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.120]   We're hoping it was RTJ, but Apple's not that hip.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.760]   What's RTJ?
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.960]   Roll the--
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.080]   Roll the--
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.920]   Something.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.600]   Apparently, yeah, the illicit substance.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.400]   Oh, I'm not that hippie.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.960]   I don't know what we're allowed to say on the air.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.440]   I don't--
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   Silence.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.840]   We're all like--
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.360]   It's crazy.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   All the runners.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   It's what it says.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.400]   Roll the juice box.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.000]   But you're the joint.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.480]   You're recycling.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.200]   Roll the joy.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   You can say joint on the show.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.480]   OK.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.160]   I could be--
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.280]   I could be spoken a spliff right now.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.120]   I don't want overcast to demonetize us.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.320]   Is Marco that sensitive to the whole thing?
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:57.320]   I will not have anyone smoking marijuana wacky weed on my punk
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   catcher.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.240]   In my app.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.200]   In my app.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.600]   No, we're just teasing you, Marco.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.120]   We know.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.960]   We don't care.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Come on, Tysus.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.360]   Anything else to say about air tags?
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.360]   Tell us about the setup.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.760]   Was it just as easy as it looks?
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.520]   Because that was the negative.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   That was really the negative on trackers and tiles.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.200]   It's Bluetooth is ugly.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.920]   Setting up Bluetooth is just not fun.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.880]   Yeah, so you literally just bring the tile close
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.840]   and it pops up with--
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.880]   Just like AirPods.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.160]   --with this little thing, just like your AirPods.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.360]   It has one extra step.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.880]   And that is it tells you very firmly
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.800]   that the serial number for this tag
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.360]   is now linked with your Apple ID.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.000]   So use them responsibly.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.720]   Because if anything bad happens,
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.120]   they may be warrants issued.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:44.640]   People don't know.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   That's really good.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.440]   Because as we talked about on Sunday,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.840]   that's that Andy Stalker functionality.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.760]   And none of these other Bluetooth trackers even
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.640]   consider that.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   I don't know as far as I can say.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.800]   Can you really well balance though?
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.240]   Because you have to-- so it has this idea
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.680]   of significant locations.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.840]   So you can put a tile on--
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.600]   I could drop a tile on Andy.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.400]   And I could see that Andy's taking the bus.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.480]   But as soon as Andy gets the library,
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.080]   that's a significant location for Andy.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.880]   Andy goes to the library all the time.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.520]   So then Andy's going to get a little thing on his iPhone.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.680]   Or if he taps it with his Android phone over NFC,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.200]   he'll get a little pop-up saying this is an air tag.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.480]   It's not registered to you.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.760]   Here's how you can take it apart if you want to.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   So if Andy stole my air tag, I have until he gets home
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.400]   or to that library to try to track him down.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.240]   But once he gets there, he's notified.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.000]   And it will start chirping if he doesn't pay attention
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.400]   to notifications for long enough just to make absolutely sure.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.440]   So my thing is it's not like a Spider-Man or Batman tracker.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.080]   It's like a Mark Rober glitter bomb
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.800]   where the person will know what it is
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.360]   and hopefully just throw it away.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.760]   And then you'll be able to go and recover it.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.240]   So if you wanted to put this in something like your kids'
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.480]   backpack just so you know where they are,
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.920]   when you're trying to meet them or something like that,
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.400]   is that something you can do with it?
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.120]   Isn't it going to beep?
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   It's going to beep.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.320]   I'm trying to figure out.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.280]   If they have an iPhone, it'll pop up on their iPhone
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.480]   and they can say ignore this notification.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.560]   No, what if they don't have an iPhone?
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.120]   It'll be fine.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   It'll just be fine.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.480]   They don't have an iPhone.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.960]   After three days, it'll, well, it depends
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.080]   because it can't track their significant locations either.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.680]   So there's a whole bunch of different conditions
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.840]   that it has to your sort of at war with,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.120]   but it would probably beep after like three days at some point.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.560]   I think they-- I think you could maybe set that too.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.720]   Sorry.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.960]   I think Apple said to someone else,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.560]   I can't remember what Charicolet read,
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:39.600]   that it's not really targeted towards tracking mammals
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.040]   like human beings.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.960]   Like your kids and your dogs.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.080]   Yeah, so that it's more for static objects.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.240]   So it would be a non-optimal use of the technology
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.240]   for many reasons.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.560]   Get them a cheap iPhone C and put that in their jacket.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.840]   Exactly.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.000]   Congratulations.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.360]   You know, you've been so good about--
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.000]   you haven't stayed up late without calling in for almost
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.640]   a month now, so we bought you a brand new iPhone that runs at 14.5.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.480]   And a battery charger, so the battery will never run down
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.000]   while you're out of our sight.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.520]   I think suspicious about that at all.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.280]   We just decided.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.000]   I bought four.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.240]   I thought this looks like--
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.840]   I mean, I used other trackers.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.360]   I have a tile right now on there,
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.120]   but just the battery's dying.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.160]   So I just feel like Apple's going to do it right.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.840]   And that's probably why tile is terrified.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.840]   Well, the tile-- I have a tile on one of my key sets,
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.280]   and it just feels very clunky looking at the Apple ones.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.240]   You're like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.280]   It doesn't look very nice.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.520]   Well, they also don't offer an M is holder.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.080]   I'll just add there.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.400]   It's proletarian.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.120]   You don't need to buy anything to hang it off of something,
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.760]   because it has that little notch in the hanging notch.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.360]   It's ready to--
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.320]   Yeah, it's ready to hang.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.840]   For us, yeah, it's a coin.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.160]   The air tag, you have to put it into something to cost money.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.240]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.000]   Yeah, they didn't want to perforate it.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.280]   They didn't want any additional holes.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   The tile's slightly square, so it can have that little loop
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.600]   as a result.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.080]   It's a great thing, because it will elevate the privacy
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.000]   and security of all computing products.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.720]   And having a billion phones out there
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.000]   means you just really--
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.920]   That's the coverage is everywhere.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.800]   Oprah has a billion phones, and the rest of us
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.720]   have a billion phones.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.280]   It feels like it's really two billion phones.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.160]   Oh, you've got a billion phones in my pocket, y'all.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.480]   Bad news, according to the Verge, Apple's magic keyboard
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.880]   that I spent $350 for on the last iPad Pro 12.9 inch
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:37.720]   will not fit on the new iPad Pro 12.9 inch,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.480]   which means I'm going to have to buy another to add insult
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.920]   to injury, $349 keyboard.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:49.160]   Let's see, it's $23.99 plus $349.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:54.520]   Now we're up to about $27.48.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.960]   Almost the cost of an original Mac.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.400]   Add text, yeah.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.480]   I mean, text--
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.680]   The display is not cheap.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.560]   If they might try the combi from Logitech,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.720]   I'm wondering if I should get that.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.200]   The keyboard?
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   Yeah, the combi touch keyboard.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.840]   It's going to be out for the new--
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.080]   Worried it.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.880]   Yeah, Laurie loved it, remember?
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.720]   They say they're going to have it out for the new iPad Pro.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.800]   It's more like a case.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.840]   It's got a kickstand.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.240]   Somebody--
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.320]   It's like a surface.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.160]   Yeah, well, more than a surface,
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.520]   because this whole thing is a case.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.640]   So somebody said it gets pretty thick and heavy,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.880]   but boy, it's a lot less expensive.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.120]   Yeah, it has Alcantara like the surface.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:39.680]   Look at that.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.080]   Oh.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.880]   Not Cheetos friendly, but it feels nice.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.160]   Maybe I will do that instead, just to know.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.080]   I want to get the--
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.320]   You're going to get both, Leo.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.840]   I mean, we've been watching the show together.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.320]   Oh, stop it.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:51.960]   No, you know what?
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.840]   I'm not thrilled about the--
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.800]   I'm not thrilled about the magic keyboard, only because the keys--
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.880]   maybe because I eat over my iPad more than I do other things.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.200]   But the keys get stuck a lot.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.160]   Like my space bar works only half the time and stuff like that.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:05.640]   Really?
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.000]   Yeah, I think I've just screwed it.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.960]   That's me.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.520]   I mean, I'm sure I've just screwed it up.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.280]   Maybe I can clean it out.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.400]   It's not a butterfly, right?
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.080]   It's the newer keyboard, so it should be easily--
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.840]   It's magic.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.440]   It's magic.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.600]   Magic being.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.240]   I was having a conversation with Jason Snell
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.800]   about these things last night or the night before over Twitter,
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.680]   and he was making the point that it is super expensive,
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.320]   obviously.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.080]   But none of the keyboards that he's tried so far--
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.440]   none of the integrated keyboard trackpads he's tried so far
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.120]   that work with Guy Pad are nearly as responsive
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.520]   that Apple seems to have some sort of a secret sauce going that
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.680]   makes the magic keyboard track pad much, much better
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.600]   than anything else out there.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.600]   So I mean, for $350, it should be perfect.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.400]   That is an advantage.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:52.760]   So Logitech has never offered it for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro,
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   but they are going to for the new one.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.000]   And it will be significantly less expensive.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.640]   $200-- let's just eliminate the penny--
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.400]   $200 for the 11-inch and $230 for the 12-inch.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.960]   So that's a $130 savings.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.640]   Apple charges $100 for magic.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.000]   I mean, that's all there is.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.600]   Magic's $130 more expensive.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   So I will be the guinea pig.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.440]   It might be a little thick.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.720]   I didn't have a Logitech case for an older iPad,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.880]   but it was it was thick, it was heavy.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.200]   I'm getting the new Magic Keyboard.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.000]   I like them a lot.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.880]   It's one of my favorite.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.520]   You really like it.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.760]   Andy and I have the exact opposite taste in keyboards,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.880]   which is why I love doing the show with them so much.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.640]   I can't use clickety-clackety keyboards.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.600]   And my joints are so messed up from Jiu Jitsu
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.520]   that anything that requires a lot of effort
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.240]   is just hard for me to type on.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.920]   So if gravity can do all the work for me
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.480]   and there's minimal movement, I'm super happy.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.080]   So I like the new MacBook keyboards.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.200]   I think they're really great.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.000]   But that Magic Keyboard on the iPad, for some reason,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   it just like a type on that thing forever.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.600]   My pick of the week this week has to do with that.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.800]   So I won't spoil it.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.160]   OK.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.600]   But Renee is absolutely right.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.200]   My attitude is that if you're going to--
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.880]   if I'm going to deal with a keyboard that's not terribly
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.160]   comfortable for me to use, I may as well save all of the weight
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.440]   and all the thickness and just use the on-screen keyboard.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.360]   Whereas if I'm in a position where I think I'm
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.720]   going to be using a keyboard, I would actually even
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.760]   rather have an external keyboard.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.240]   That can be like even 10 times better than anything
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.920]   that would integrate with a lid.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.360]   I like this because, in fact, you could show this.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.800]   The kickstand means you could watch it with a kickstand
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.960]   with a keyboard attached.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.920]   Because the keyboard just attaches to the bottom of this.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.520]   But you can also use the kickstand and the keyboard.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.600]   You know, they're going to flip it around here in a second.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.000]   There it is.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.720]   I think that that's actually a good form factor.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.000]   I kind of like that idea that the keyboard attaches.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   So I don't know.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.040]   That's one of the brilliant things about these tablets.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.280]   And one of the many reasons why I wish that Apple had gone,
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.680]   had not bet on that wrong horse, in my opinion,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.080]   and gone with a multi-touch on Max.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.920]   Because once you have a detachable screen,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.600]   with the iPad Pro, you can have it as a flat tablet.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.360]   That is the slimmest damn thing you ever
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.600]   want when you're just watching movies or reading comics.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.280]   Or you can plug it into something that
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.360]   makes it into something more of a laptop that will actually
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.280]   sit in your lap.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.200]   Or you can make it into a detached sort of system
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.520]   that's more of a desktop sort of thing.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.680]   So when I'm at that snag that table on the commuter rail
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.760]   train, it's like I've got my screen.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.240]   I've got my keyboard where I want it.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.520]   I've got my mouse where I want it.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.640]   I'm getting the entire desktop effect.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.280]   And I can choose which of these modes
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.800]   that I want to use depending on what
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   accessory I use with it.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.280]   So that's a really attractive thing.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.360]   And I just wish you could do that with a Mac.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.280]   Well, I think that--
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.040]   Can I take a second because there is this hole?
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.540]   Go ahead.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.640]   Go ahead, Renee.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.160]   Go on, Renee.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:49.480]   OK.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.240]   So there was this whole thing that--
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.880]   there's this huge misconception when
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.920]   it comes to Apple Silicon.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.720]   And I don't know why because Apple does
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.280]   go to great pains to explain it.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.640]   But the minute the M1 came out, people were like,
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.160]   I can't wait for the iPad to get Apple Silicon.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.800]   And we were like, no, it's Apple Silicon for 10 years.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.360]   And now the iPad has the M1.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.000]   And people are like, I can't wait for the iPhone to get M1.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.040]   No, it's M1 is A14.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.800]   It's an A14.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.960]   But it's given people this idea that the iPad can now
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.560]   miraculously run Mac OS software.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.480]   That just because it's the M1.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.400]   And there's been a lot of people writing about Apple
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.680]   bringing either iPad OS to the Mac or Mac OS to the iPad.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.880]   And I'm still hoping that we get Apple OS or Swift OS, which
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.600]   does exactly what Andy said.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.240]   It's like a endpoint neutral input method neutral.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.680]   It's on all your Apple stuff.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.840]   It knows what inputs are available.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   If you want to touch you touch, if you have a keyboard,
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.760]   mouse, pencil, all these things, it just feels like we're
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.560]   getting everything from Swift ASI to Swift OS at some point
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:48.880]   from Apple.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.400]   That's so hard to do, though, Renee.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.240]   Because-- and this is why Microsoft
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.600]   had so much trouble with it in Windows 8--
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.280]   is that the touch targets for a mouse-based OS, Mac OS,
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.520]   are too tiny for an iPad-based OS.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.000]   And so I guess you could have a switch flip.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.480]   And suddenly, the menus go away or something.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.320]   But it's going to be very modal.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.760]   And I think that that's not going to work.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.440]   And this is the problem Microsoft has.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.080]   They really had it with 8.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.200]   They've solved it a little bit with Windows 10.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.120]   Because it goes into tablet mode.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.560]   But the small touch targets make Mac OS very difficult
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560]   to use with touch.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.760]   But I think that once you start to integrate both of the
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.600]   experiences together, it doesn't have to be that you're
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.160]   using all of one or all of the other.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.600]   So I know that when I have--
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.840]   being able to use a mouse and a keyboard and then just
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.280]   touching the things that I want to touch is useful.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.080]   Not that I want to touch the whole--
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.000]   everything all the time.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.880]   I don't want to sit there and try to use Final Cut with that.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.640]   But I would love to be able to click on certain things
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.040]   or move things around.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.920]   A lot of times for me, this gets back into my methodology
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.440]   of how I do build keynote documents.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.120]   Is that I have to go to my iPad to draw it.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.680]   But then I have to come back to the OS to actually finish
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.480]   the keynote document, because the iPad is too inefficient.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   It's too inefficient for me to just build a deck by itself
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.000]   on the Mac, in my opinion.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   And too inefficient to try to build the rest of the deck
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.680]   on the iPad.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.880]   And I just want both of them to emerge.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.600]   If I could just draw on that and then use the tools the way
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.000]   they were designed, because the touch interface, to your
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.040]   point, is very hard to use for high definition placement
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.080]   and so on and so forth that you would need for a real doc.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.440]   What I was thinking about how to leverage the M1 chip in both
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.640]   the machines is to come up with the most--
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.400]   back to my Mac 3000, where instead of having a system where
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.520]   the traditional remote access, where you're basically
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.040]   live streaming the screen from a computer you have at home,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.240]   it would still require you have your Mac Mini or your MacBook
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.720]   or whatever up and running back home.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.040]   But because it has that shared--
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.880]   it could possibly use a shared code base,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.360]   because it's using exactly the same CPU.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   What if it was all it was doing was sending UI events back
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.520]   to your original Mac, the Mac sends back,
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.520]   here's what I want the UI to do.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.840]   And now the iPad just does it instead
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.200]   of reproducing an image that's on the screen back home.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.120]   It's actually drawing the interface as it goes.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.360]   So it's not running the app natively, necessarily,
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.120]   but maybe hunks of that code could run on the M1.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.280]   And I wouldn't mind so much that if my mindset is in the mode
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.360]   of I just have this super, super, super slim and portable Mac
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.520]   that can also do iPad things, I would--
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.320]   and if it would also help Apple to sell me a new Mac back
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.680]   at home, I would actually be very interested in that,
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.120]   because one of the things I was using the iPad for a lot
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.320]   was simply remote access back to my Mac and my Windows
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.200]   machines.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.120]   The independent addressed this a little bit
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.720]   in their interview with Jaws and John Turnus.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.040]   So good interview.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.520]   Unfortunately, it's behind a paywall.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.360]   So I read the 9 to 5 Mac summary of it.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:14.520]   But both Jaws and Turnus addressed this by saying,
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.040]   well, I'll give you Jaws's quote.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.640]   There's two conflicting stories people
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.480]   like to tell about the iPad and the Mac.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.760]   On the one hand, people say they're in conflict with each other
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.600]   that somebody has to decide whether they want a Mac
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.760]   or they want an iPad.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.240]   Or people say we're merging them into one
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.480]   that there's this grand conspiracy we have
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.520]   to eliminate two categories and make them one.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.760]   And the reality is neither is true.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.160]   We're really proud of the fact that we work really, really
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.440]   hard to create the best products in their respective categories
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.640]   and Turnus backed it.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   Said, yeah, each team is just saying,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.160]   no, let's make the best iPad.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.840]   Let's make the best Mac.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.480]   And maybe that is the answer.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.240]   Maybe that's the bottom line.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.200]   That's what you're going about that though.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   Because one of Apple's greatest strengths
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.920]   is that they've never been precious about their products.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.720]   They never mistook them for their business.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.200]   They were never the iPod company.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.880]   They were never even the Mac company.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.560]   Where Microsoft famously would not
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.760]   let go of Windows until it was in bombers, not
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.880]   cold dead hands.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.560]   And they rode that into the ground.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.840]   But Apple, they will skewer the iPod for the iPhone
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.680]   because they'd rather do that than somebody else.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.800]   And Phil Schiller has famously had-- he has this doctrine
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.960]   where he says that it's the iPhone's job
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.360]   to push so hard against the iPad that we question
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.800]   the existence of the iPad.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.960]   And then it's the iPad's job to improve.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.760]   So we question the importance, the relevance of the Mac.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   And then the Mac has to fight back by doing things
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.800]   none of those can do and force them to get better.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.160]   And Apple is almost like gladiatorial combat.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.560]   They just want the iPhone and the iPad to fight.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.040]   So the iPad and the Mac to fight.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.080]   And we can pick the one we want for now.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.920]   And one day they'll see which one sort of is winning.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.320]   And it'll get to a point where one subsumes the other.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.640]   Or they both go on.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.560]   Or some third thing replaces them.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.480]   But they're not their children.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.840]   These are the associations that's
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.920]   really important to do.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.960]   Yeah, they're completely willing to let one beat the other.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.040]   There's no--
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.960]   Fight for mommy's love.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.760]   Fight for mommy's love.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.960]   We can't love you both.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.320]   Believe.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.000]   And it goes back and forth.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.320]   Like the iPad looked like it was killing.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.840]   And then it went down and the Mac was killing.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.600]   And now there's sort of neck and neck to race.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.520]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.720]   Renee Richie's back.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.000]   Andy Inacos here.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.080]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.560]   And we're talking about Apple.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.040]   And it's a conversation.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.640]   I can go on for a good long time.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.560]   But I did want it before we go much further ask you,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.680]   because I've got two credits in my Audible account left.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.480]   And they're running out.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.440]   And I-- well, I have a couple of weeks.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.160]   I just want to get some recommendations.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.360]   Audible, our sponsor.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.920]   They've been our sponsor for so long.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.640]   I've been actually an Audible member for even longer
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.000]   than they've been a sponsor.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.680]   I've got my Audible account in 2000, the year 2000,
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.280]   21 years ago.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.400]   It saved me when I had those long commutes down to tech TV
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.600]   every day.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.720]   And this still saves me.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.120]   Because now I'm not in the car commuting,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.520]   but I still listen to Audible even.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.680]   OK.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.840]   I play this game, and I play it a lot called Valheim.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.800]   And I don't want to feel like I'm wasting my life,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.480]   because it's like hours and hours.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.280]   So I listen to audiobooks while I'm playing it.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.840]   It's taken the place of my commute.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.120]   And it's great.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.880]   It's a wonderful way to listen to audiobooks
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.600]   while you're doing something else-- washing dishes,
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.560]   walking the dog, or playing a video game.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.280]   And you're getting it read to you by somebody really, really
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.680]   talented.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.440]   There's a new book from Andy Weir, the creator of The Martian.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.360]   He's got a great reader.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.680]   And then sometimes the reader is the writer, especially--
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.600]   I love this with autobiographies.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.280]   I'm listening to Barack Obama's "The Promised Land."
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.480]   And he reads it.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.280]   And there's just some--
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.480]   first of all, he's a great orator.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.240]   So he can read it beautifully.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.080]   But there's also a reality to it, because you know,
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.720]   he's talking-- you're hearing the guy talking about
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.880]   his experiences in the Oval Office.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.000]   That's really-- it's just great.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.560]   Audible's the leading provider of spoken word entertainment
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.040]   all in one place.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.760]   Not just audiobooks ranging from bestsellers and new releases
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.720]   to celebrity memoirs to language lessons to business
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.960]   to motivation.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.520]   There's original entertainment from top celebrity creators.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.120]   There are thousands of popular and binge-worthy podcasts
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.400]   all ad-free on Audible too.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.720]   They just offered something new.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.480]   And it's really great.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.760]   It's called Audible Plus.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.000]   Audible Plus gives you full access to their popular plus
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.480]   catalog.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.800]   You get a chance to listen to--
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.320]   I don't know how many thousands and thousands
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.640]   of popular audiobooks, original entertainment podcasts,
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.880]   ad-free versions of your favorite shows, exclusive series,
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.680]   new formats like the Words Plus Music Series, Andy.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.960]   A short while ago, you recommended
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.760]   the incredible Neil Gaiman Sandman, which
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.880]   is basically a theatrical production of the Sandman
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.280]   with acted out.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.600]   There's even actual plays on Audible.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.880]   All available to download or stream in the Audible app.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.200]   You can listen anytime, anywhere, on any device.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.240]   You'll never lose your spot.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.040]   Actually, you can listen to your browser too on your desktop.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.840]   To use your Audible membership, you
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.440]   do want to get the Audible app for that Audible Plus.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.680]   The Audible app is free.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.640]   All right, Andy, what are you listening to?
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.360]   I have recommendations.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   I know.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.560]   The first one I got to re-recommend, Devil in the White
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.160]   City.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:31.960]   Oh, I love that.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.480]   I've read it.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.520]   I love it.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.240]   Devil in the White City is one of those just monumental stories
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.520]   that sucks you in.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.600]   It's the lurid thing that gets you into it
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.600]   is, oh, well, the first prolific serial killer who
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.720]   trade upon travelers coming to the 1893 Columbiaan
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.480]   Exposition in Chicago by building this satanic hotel
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.640]   with trapdoors and pits and things like that.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.760]   And that is exciting.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.120]   That does get you through it.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.520]   But it tells the whole story of here
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.640]   is what the world was like in 1893.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.040]   Here is what the country was like in 1893.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.280]   Here is what the city of Chicago was like.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.800]   It gets into these personal stories
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.600]   of just the story of Chicago really, really desperately
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.200]   wanting to host this exposition and beating out
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.000]   so many other cities that had international re-renowned
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.040]   because they wanted to establish themselves as, no,
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.440]   we're not just a bunch of thugs who slaughter cattle,
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.320]   who have this terrible, terrible city.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.840]   We are actually a metropolis.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.400]   We are building.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.480]   We're on our way up.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.360]   And then they get it.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.720]   And now we're asked all of these political and sociological
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.400]   factions that were working together
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.600]   to get this honor of hosting this event.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.400]   Now they're fighting against each other
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.960]   because now each wants to get the event happening
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.760]   in their part of the city or using this piece of land
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.240]   that they want to be redeveloped.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.000]   Meanwhile, you have the artists who are like, no,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.360]   we have to really show off.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.280]   We are coming off of the most Paris exposition,
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.320]   which the entire world is still talking about
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.840]   is something that will never be beaten.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.640]   We are going to be compared to the Paris exposition
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.600]   if we do terrible things because a real estate developer
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.120]   wants to use this landlocked piece of property
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.520]   that is terrible to work on has no architectural possibilities
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.440]   as possible to get to.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.120]   We'll be laughing stocks forever.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.360]   It's just this beautiful environmental story
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.440]   about what this microcosm of interactions
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.560]   was like in the 1890s.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.320]   There's this little sub-story because in the Paris exposition
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.040]   they built the Eiffel Tower.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.720]   And Chicago said, well, what do we do to beat that?
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.960]   They invented and built the first ferris wheel.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.320]   And the story of that is great.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.720]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.560]   Anybody else?
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.880]   I mean, I don't want to make this a half hour commercial,
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.160]   although it's easy to do.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.320]   But they were weekly.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.080]   That was like an extra 20 minutes easy.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.440]   It was my favorite stuff.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.480]   And I'm always looking for new recommendations.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.560]   Anybody?
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.160]   Alex Renee, you got something you want?
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.000]   I'm reading an embarrassing one.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.560]   It's all about embarrassing is that it's embarrassing
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.400]   to tip this long.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.880]   Devin Stone, friend of mine, Legal Eagle,
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.720]   kept saying I had to read Primal Branding
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.920]   just because I had to learn the words
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.040]   that would be the key to unlocking my true potential.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.880]   I have not read this.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.080]   I have to--
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.280]   I need to read this.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.120]   It's like super fan.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.480]   Actually, it'd be good to read because it's like super fans.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.560]   It's about your 1,000 true fans.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:18.960]   I used to end up--
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.320]   Sell that for your brand.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.360]   --as your company and your future.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.040]   Wow.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.720]   I've been digging through the shop class as SoulCraft,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.880]   which is really cool.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.960]   Just the importance of being able to do things physically
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.200]   and how that makes a difference
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.680]   and how we've moved away from that.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.640]   So I was kind of-- as I think about that,
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   because I think about craft a lot.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.000]   So as we do what I do with office hours and so--
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.080]   But it's a great--
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:47.600]   It's really good.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.000]   It's a great listen.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.480]   Yeah, it's really, really good.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.840]   And I like to listen to it while I make SDI cables.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.560]   I'm sitting there crafting away my little ends
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.320]   and everything else and listening to it.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.680]   It makes 100 SDI cables go a lot faster.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.760]   This sounds a little bit like Zen in the art of motorcycle
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.560]   making it a little bit--
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.040]   Just like a next generation of that.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.200]   Oh, man.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.560]   Shop class is SoulCraft and anchoring
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.080]   into the value of work by Matthew B. Crawford
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.860]   and really recommended Primal branding,
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.280]   create zealots for your brand, your company,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.120]   and your future by Patrick Hanlon.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:23.840]   And--
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.760]   Oh, you'll forgive me.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.040]   But my mom says you need Clara and the Sun
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.320]   by Kazuo Ishiguro, a futuristic look
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.720]   about artificial intelligence.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.360]   Oh.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.520]   The good thing about Audible, the thing they've done that's
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.400]   really great is they have their own studios.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.880]   I think a bunch of them.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.680]   And they record stuff that never got--
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.520]   a lot of these audiobooks are made by the publisher.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.920]   But there was a lot of older science fiction and stuff
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.760]   that was never recorded.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.000]   And they've gone back.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.920]   And for instance, if you're getting ready for foundation
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.320]   and you want to reread the foundation,
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.200]   there's a really good brand new production of the foundation.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.720]   I want to say trilogy, but it's really like a--
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.600]   I don't know how many there are now.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.520]   But Isaac Asimov's classic, the series,
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.680]   that's what we'll call it, the foundation series.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.200]   Scott Brick narrates it.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.960]   And it's really, really well done.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.800]   He's the same guy who does the devil in the White City, which
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.520]   is Andy's recommendation by Eric Larson.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.480]   What are you waiting for?
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.560]   Delvin, to your next title, we just
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.480]   gave you a four to pick from Audible Plus.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.200]   New members can try Audible Plus for 30 days,
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.000]   download the Audible app, get started with a free trial.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.080]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E Audible.com/Macbreak.

[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.320]   Their short code is 500-500.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:45.960]   Text Macbreak, M-A-C-B-R-E-A-K to 500-500 or go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.520]   Get started with the free trial.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.760]   Good to have you back, Audible.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.640]   We missed you.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.400]   OK.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.280]   OK.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:51.880]   OK.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.200]   What else has happened in the world of Apple?
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.480]   Ransomware gang.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.000]   I don't know if I even wanted to talk about this.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.320]   We talked about it on Sunday.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:06.760]   And so our evil, which is a ransomware gang, hacked
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.880]   Quanta, which is a company that makes laptops for a lot of
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   company, including Apple.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.560]   And apparently, our evil claims, they've got all the
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.280]   schematics of new Apple MacBooks.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.280]   And they will start releasing them to the world unless Apple
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.640]   or Quanta pays $50 million.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.880]   And they released two schematics already.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.160]   The question I asked on Sunday is, if I talk about this, am I
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.280]   kind of--
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.520]   if I show the schematics, am I encouraging the theft of
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.960]   Apple's intellectual property?
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.960]   I don't want to do that.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.120]   But at the same time, don't you want to know?
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.680]   Only Apple paying the ransom would encourage the theft of
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.040]   an Apple's intellectual property.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   So I won't be nice and not show you or say anything about
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.480]   what we've learned, except that I can't wait till June 7th.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.280]   I don't think Apple might be saying that, right?
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   You can cover that.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.360]   It happened covering what it happens and who did it
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.080]   gives them unnecessary.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.600]   Exactly.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.680]   I'll just say that the only hints that we need to give is
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.160]   that if what they posted is actually truly what Apple's
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.360]   coming up with, the idea of, I do want to come up with a
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.920]   design sticker that basically says Andy was right and make
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.800]   it size so that people can put it right on the brand new,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.320]   whatever it is.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.080]   This is because this is the--
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.240]   So the latest on this, and I don't know if Apple paid or
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:46.280]   Quanta paid or what, but the no, the hackers are no longer
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.200]   going to release it.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.800]   Or maybe they just sent the Hitokiri Batusai after them.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.760]   Maybe they just got a phone call from Liam Neeson.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.320]   I don't know, but something happened.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.720]   And they've removed, mysteriously removed these--
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.960]   Alex has a very specific--
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.720]   Yes, I have a--
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.360]   That was like a perfect shot of skill.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.560]   Let me show you the back end.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.840]   Let me show you what Zoom can really do.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.760]   You had no idea this was possible.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:18.960]   Time Magazine, 100 most influential companies in the
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.520]   world of course.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.240]   Apple's got to be on that list.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.200]   Doubling down on defining products.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.320]   Got a little alliteration in there as well.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.680]   You don't even really need to say anything.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.880]   Of course, Apple's on that list.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.720]   I said, "Dongles."
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.560]   Doubling down on to--
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.400]   Doubling down on to--
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.880]   Finding dongles, that would be--
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   Then you get the 4Ds.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:45.280]   Apple has been told by a judge, you know?
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.920]   When you use the word "buy" on the iTunes store, it kind of
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.400]   implies that somebody owns something.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.160]   And maybe they don't.
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.760]   I will say that this is a really--
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.280]   It's a bad here.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:02.080]   I will say though that I usually defend Apple on this one,
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.160]   but this is a really bad policy that Apple has.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.080]   That if you-- so I've had it where I've changed my--
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.760]   I've changed my ATM card or whatever that was connected
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.680]   to my Apple account.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.480]   And suddenly, I can't watch anything.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.800]   Things that I quote unquote "purchased."
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.240]   Until I put the new credit card in or whatever to update that,
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.960]   it literally just shuts me off from everything.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.640]   And it definitely smacks up, well, I didn't really own that.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.440]   It's not like something that I actually owned,
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   because if I actually owned it, I could keep on using it
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.480]   because I had paid for it.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.200]   And I think that Apple has really missed the mark on this one.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.840]   The case involves someone who got their Apple ID terminated
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.200]   and lost access to $25,000 worth of content
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.400]   that he purchased, and that's kind of BS.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.840]   It was such a-- one of the things that offends me,
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.160]   and I hate to be offended by this stuff,
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.520]   because it's the worst thing, is that it was just bad lawyering.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.560]   It's like Epic's level bad lawyering.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.320]   And I'm not a lawyer, so I can't really say this.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.720]   But I would have just gone in and said, hey, it's a relic.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.600]   People used to buy this stuff and download it.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.280]   Now everybody streams, and we never changed the button.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.720]   And nobody changes a button.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.200]   Everyone still has that button.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:10.720]   You know, just--
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.560]   You made it interesting--
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.680]   You got off Sunday, though.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.520]   You still could download it, right?
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.480]   Yeah, you can download them.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.280]   No, you still can.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.000]   You can download them.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.400]   But I mean, people don't, because streaming is so convenient.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.080]   But you used to not be able to stream.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.680]   You'd have to download everything, put it on your backup
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.880]   computer, burn them, a contrary to the wishes
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.040]   of the internet, of the studios, all those things.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.200]   And even if you download it, it does have DRM on it,
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.480]   a copy protection on it.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.640]   And if the Apple--
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.400]   For some reason, Apple decided not to authenticate it.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.880]   As in this guy's case, you wouldn't
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.200]   be able to play it without stripping DRM out, which is--
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.680]   That's why some of us buy traditional media and--
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.040]   Right.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.960]   Stripper ourselves.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.560]   Right.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.800]   So is the word buy?
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.360]   But I mean, you know, this is--
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.040]   it's not just Apple that does this.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.440]   Most software you buy, but you don't own.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.520]   Even if you're buying eBooks, you don't--
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.680]   I mean, that you're buying a book on--
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.480]   I think the hard part really is this.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.080]   --is a subscribe discussion, right?
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.320]   This whole-- I totally get it.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.640]   If your credit card isn't working and it says, oh,
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.880]   you can't get anything new, you can't buy anything new
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.520]   that you didn't buy before, then that would be fine.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   But when you can't use the things that you theoretically--
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.280]   that they said buy until you update it,
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.320]   that's all kinds of bad, in my opinion.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.520]   Well, the judge agreed.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.720]   The judge agreed that Apple made a motion to dismiss.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.880]   And the judge said, US District Court Judge
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.760]   Mondez said, you know, Apple contends--
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.640]   this is in his judgment--
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.600]   contends that no reasonable consumer would
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.960]   believe that purchased content would remain on the iTunes
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.760]   platform indefinitely.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.160]   But in common usage, the term buy means
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.880]   to acquire possession over something.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.200]   It seems--
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.280]   And what would you replace it with?
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.760]   Like, what would we use?
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.080]   What's a good word for this?
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:02.600]   Rent.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.760]   Do we have to make a point?
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.280]   At the library.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:05.960]   At the library.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:06.880]   Well, it's not rent, correct?
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.880]   Yeah, we're at the library.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.720]   Rent sounds like it's going to go away.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.400]   And they already have a rent.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.480]   You can rent a movie to watch it.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.880]   I like to add to library.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.680]   Then add to library.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.280]   Something like that.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.120]   But it's that you pay for it to add to library.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.720]   But buy is not true.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.040]   No, it's not true.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.720]   I don't think we have the verbiage to understand
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.680]   all the different--
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.360]   on Apple Music, you subscribe, and you get everything.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.800]   And then you can add things to your library
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.560]   that you want to have easily accessible.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.400]   And there's a download.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.920]   It's like there's so many states of content.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.800]   And streaming is different because you can buy something.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.360]   You can pay a monthly fee to Netflix.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:41.120]   And Netflix doesn't have what TV+ has.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.360]   I think Apple could easily fix most of this
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.440]   if they just said no matter what state your account's in,
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.200]   you can always download the ones that you purchased.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.760]   You could at least watch them.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.120]   Like right now, they just cut you off from everything.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.280]   I mean, that's the issue.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.800]   And you can rent something for, let's say, $7 or $4.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.200]   It's more like $5.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.480]   And you could buy it for $10.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.360]   But is there really any functional difference
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.560]   in renting it for--
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.400]   Well, there is.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.560]   I never rent anything.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.160]   Might as well just buy a difference in prices.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.400]   Yeah, because you rent it.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.040]   And I never get to it in time.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.680]   Like, it's always--
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.760]   I always get it.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.000]   I start it too soon.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.640]   And also, you don't get any of the extras, which I do want.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.040]   We should mention that Amazon's being sued for something
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.720]   similar because this is what-- this is the terminology
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.280]   everybody uses is buy.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.360]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.120]   I'm torn because--
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.520]   Yeah, add to libraries probably the better.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.160]   Ruby, it just doesn't fit on a button.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.240]   $15 add to libraries.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.160]   It could be add.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:43.880]   It could be add.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.080]   But it just buys disingenuous.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.160]   That's the problem.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.480]   And that's what's getting in trouble.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.000]   So I don't know-- we're going to go to rumors.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.600]   I don't know about this one.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.760]   According to Nikkei Asia, Apple has gone and do mass production
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.960]   for a new Apple Silicon chip, the successor to the M1.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.760]   They say TSMC made chips, says, will replace Intel offerings
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.840]   and laptops set to launch in the second half.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.760]   We don't know if it'll be called the--
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   It's such a bad article.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.080]   Yeah, they use the word M2.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.680]   We don't know if that's what it's going to be called.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.440]   It could just be--
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.840]   M2 has to be coming.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.040]   So this is where people get confused again.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.280]   So M1 is an A14 with extra bits for the Mac.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.480]   It's functionally an A14X with like a Thunderbolt controller
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.880]   and some virtualization and emulation accelerators.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.720]   And so we have the M1.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.560]   There should be an M1X, which would
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.080]   be an extended version of that with even more cores.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.960]   But an M2 would just be the A15.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.480]   And we know the A15, based on past history,
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.760]   is coming with the iPhone 12S in September.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.160]   So they've got to be working on the M2 as well,
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.440]   because that's got to come out in October, November,
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.920]   unless Apple skips--
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.120]   because they didn't make an X version of every chip.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.120]   They made like--
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.640]   three of them didn't have X versions.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.360]   The A7, there was no A7X, no A11X, no A13X.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.600]   But all the other ones did.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.760]   So it's theoretically possible Apple won't make one.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.040]   But if they are, it's going to come in October.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.840]   So of course, they're working on it.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.120]   OK.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.040]   There you go.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.360]   The rumor confirmed by a lot of--
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.800]   It's like they're making a new iPhone.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.200]   Remember every year, Apple working
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.400]   on a new version of iOS, Apple working on a new iPhone.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.960]   And it's going to be the best ever.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.200]   It'll be 20% faster.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.560]   A15 will be 20% faster.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.040]   It is not necessarily the case yet.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.480]   But the Financial Times says the EU will be charging Apple
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.240]   with anti-competitive behavior this week over the App Store,
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:53.000]   saying Apple's App Store breaks European law.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.600]   This we shall see.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.520]   This is the complaint that was brought by Spotify over the 30%
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.920]   commission.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.600]   It's going to go as well for them as they did for a slip
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.200]   near.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.240]   They're going to win, and they're going to lose market share.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.360]   Well, we'll see.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.800]   That's just a rumor we'll be watching the wire, as they say.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.280]   This has been an aggressive campaign.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.840]   This is how change happens, at least with Apple.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.160]   Because they don't--
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.400]   they have blinders on certain situations, where even if they're
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.240]   not doing anything wrong, they don't understand that they
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.200]   have to be--
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.080]   people are not required to simply trust
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.600]   that they're not doing anything wrong,
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.280]   and that this is all coming to a head at this point, where
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.280]   if the EU is--
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.160]   if they are insistent that they're not
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.040]   doing anything wrong with how they run the App Store,
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.640]   that's fine.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.680]   But now you're going to have to make that case in a court
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.160]   of law, and you might lose.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.960]   And so this is a good opportunity for you
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.640]   to revisit a lot of these decisions
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.240]   that you've been making about how you run the operation.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.040]   And maybe there is some wiggle room
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.240]   that concessions that you can make,
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.520]   so that you at least can make a show of how, look, we are so
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.040]   concerned about appearing that we're--
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.560]   even just the appearance that we're
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.080]   running things fair and square, that we are willing to continue
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.320]   to make adjustments and concessions as they come by.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.640]   I mean, unless you think that they've
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.560]   made all those changes to the App Store, because, oh, well,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.920]   we had that planned already.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.320]   We've been listening to our developers
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.800]   and to the outreach from the community.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.880]   And so it's because they were getting pressure from people
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.760]   that they can't control.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.400]   I mean, I think that I'm curious as to whether people say,
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.880]   well, they're not at anything, so they shouldn't get a percentage.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.400]   And like, well, if we let people install stuff on the phone,
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.600]   but they can't use any of the security features of the phone
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.840]   and they can't talk to any part of the--
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.000]   we'll let you do it.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.880]   But that's because that's what you're paying for.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.720]   Like, when you're paying for those percentages,
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.560]   you're paying for the ecosystem that makes it safe and makes it easy
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.800]   and makes it all those things.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.520]   That environment, I think, is being undervalued
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.760]   by a lot of the folks suing them.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.400]   And I bet you, someone in Apple is thinking about when
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.440]   the fallback position is, OK, we'll give it to you,
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.760]   and we'll give it to you in a way that doesn't take advantage
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.480]   of any of what we bring.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.560]   And we'll see how many consumers actually want that.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.680]   You know, like, I think--
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.000]   This is the other side.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.440]   I guess it's the other side that's
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.720]   going to get them in trouble that there are a lot of cases
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.240]   to be made why the App Store is worth a percentage cut,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.920]   including the one Ben Thompson made recently,
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.160]   which I thought was really a can-y, which is that just having
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.400]   a credit card that's not expired, there's so much churn that
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.040]   involves credit cards expiring.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.480]   And that's not the case on the App Store.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.800]   And that can be invaluable to a lot of developers.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.240]   But it's that Apple has competing products on that store.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.280]   And I think they'll get hammered for Apple Music
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:37.160]   and for the things that make Spotify and those other particular
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.480]   developers so angry.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.600]   And it's very little to do.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.040]   I mean, Epic is super upset about the fees that Apple charges,
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.760]   even though they charge fees on their store.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.800]   But I think if the US and the EU have their way,
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.680]   Apple will be the platform, but no longer the content filler
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.000]   of that platform.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.840]   I'm also very, very pleased that though it's well
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.480]   good for them to say, "Yes, but we run a--"
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.200]   It's a safe environment that we have that we'd be giving up
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.680]   if we allowed this sort of thing to happen.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.560]   And people can trust the apps that they get from the App Store.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.800]   This is an opportunity for, again, people
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.640]   that Apple can't control to say, "Yeah,
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.720]   but what about that guy who lost a million dollars in Bitcoin
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.360]   because he downloaded a fraudulent app that had been approved
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.320]   by the App Store?
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.360]   What about this other situation here?"
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.840]   It's, again, every single company, even the ones
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.080]   that I mostly trust, I am absolutely in favor of them
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.440]   being forced to defend the statements that they're making
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.320]   that to certify the claims they're making about those products.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.280]   And I think that by and large, when it comes to the App Store,
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.320]   Apple has not been made to prove that what they've
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.200]   been saying for years about the App Store and its advantages
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.760]   are actually true.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.760]   Well, I mean, the thing is--
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   Thank Gatekeeper to the fact that you could buy--
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.080]   I just give them Gatekeeper.
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.520]   Yeah, I pay 30%.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.160]   I'll just help them.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:56.480]   I pay 15% or 30% just to not have to deal with password,
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.320]   like trying to protect my software.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.400]   I mean, that's why all the software is so cheap.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.600]   But that's why all the software is so cheap,
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.960]   because instead of getting one paying customer for every 100,
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.520]   you're getting one paying--
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   and not having to deal with all the things that
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   are unpalatable to the user, all that stuff goes away
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.880]   when you have-- that ecosystem is extremely valuable.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.680]   And that's the thing that Apple does really well,
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.840]   and Google does in play, is make it easy for someone
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.760]   to buy something where the user doesn't have to deal with
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.920]   passwords and registration and all the other stupid things.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:35.120]   But everybody who buys it is paying the developer.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.520]   And that's a very--
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.760]   I remember selling software when that didn't exist,
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760]   and it was really painful.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760]   Clips is added--
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   I'm going to go over first.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.260]   Go ahead.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.600]   I'm sorry, Renee.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.840]   And I was going to say, you'll see a lot of--
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.200]   our friendly app developers will talk about their fears
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.680]   that piracy will go up if Apple does slide loading.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.560]   But I think--
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.160]   I don't think it would solve any real problems.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.680]   I think it'd be one of those things
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.200]   where be careful what you wish for,
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.560]   but it would get so much off of Apple's back
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.760]   if you could just gatekeeper things on the iPhone.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.280]   People think it will magically allow VPN apps in China.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.560]   And it won't, because they're blocking the server level,
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.480]   not the app level.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.920]   But it gives people what they think they want.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.160]   And I think it takes a lot of the litigation off of Apple's back.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:14.640]   Yep.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.160]   I agree.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.480]   New feature in Apple.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.280]   Clips just updated.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.720]   They talked about it in the event.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.800]   You press the little star here.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.920]   And it's something pops up that says AR Spaces.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.560]   Scan your surroundings to apply AR effects.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:32.600]   This is kind of like the app that you were doing the other day
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.520]   last week, Alex.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.120]   So I'm going to scan.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.720]   I'm going to continue to move your iPhone.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.680]   It's not building.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.240]   It's built-- oh, it is building a model.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.040]   It looks very much like that model on that app of my surroundings.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.320]   And it's got dots and lines and voxels.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.520]   So it's just giving-- it's basically
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.080]   creating collision surfaces.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:54.560]   It doesn't have to be super accurate or pretty.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.000]   But it doesn't need to know where things start and end.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.040]   So I'm done.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.920]   I'm going to start effects.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.920]   And now, oh, yeah.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:01.440]   Look at that.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.240]   I can put-- I can put Confetti.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.360]   Clips, try it.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.360]   You'll like it.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.160]   D-brand, boy, they didn't take long.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.880]   They are now offering skins that turn that white bezel
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:21.520]   on the new color IMAX Black for $50.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.720]   That's much easier.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.220]   It's easy.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:23.720]   It's easy.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.320]   It's a mess.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.440]   It's important to-- a designer takes as much pride
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.200]   in how the edges of the screen are painted
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.480]   than as the front and the back.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.040]   That's a design principle.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:42.640]   Alex, didn't you used to have a 30% gray room to work in?
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.200]   Maybe you do that.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.080]   Most of my room.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.480]   So what do I think of a white bezel?
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.240]   I mean, isn't that a bad choice?
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.680]   I hate you.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.240]   I hate it.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.040]   Yeah, so I-- no, not interested.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.600]   I'll find some way to make it darker.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.240]   Well, D-brand is selling this matte black.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.200]   Well, it's not the pro.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.480]   This isn't the pro version.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:00.960]   No.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.600]   It is.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.160]   It's a consumer kids bedroom version.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.120]   It looks good in your kids better.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.160]   The pro one's going to be black, which we bet right now
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.480]   that the M1 expiration of the IMac has black bezel.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.480]   So my IMac Pro had--
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.480]   Pro and Dark Ray.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.320]   --that was dark gray.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.240]   It was looked pretty good.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.280]   Actually, it's very pretty with a black Apple logo on it.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.560]   Finally, there was just a still of Ted Lasso on the event
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.440]   last week.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.640]   And it said-- they talked about Sherbread.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.720]   Ted Lasso's secret sharp bragg makes about one box,
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.240]   and they cut it off because it's secret, right?
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.920]   Except, you know, it actually--
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.600]   kind of see it.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.400]   David Smith wrote in his blog.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:45.320]   Well, that looks like a 1 and 1/2 cups, 340 grams,
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.160]   cold, unsalted butter.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.520]   And he said, oh, wait.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.520]   Did he make it?
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.840]   You googled it.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.800]   And look what you find.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.480]   You find a New York Times recipe that
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.600]   has exactly 1 and 1/2 cups, 340 grams, cold, unsalted butter.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.760]   Three sticks, cut into 1/2 inch pieces.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.920]   Now, it's for a bittersweet brownie shortbread.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.280]   That's not what Ted Lasso's given people.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.840]   So you'd have to take out the--
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.320]   But he's giving them American shortbread in London.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.360]   Actually, there is a regular shortbread.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.160]   It's a double-- it's like a layer kick.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.640]   So one layer is just plain old shortbread.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:23.600]   All it is butter.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.200]   I want you to make it, Alex.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.040]   Butter, a lot of it.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:27.880]   Three sticks.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.600]   You have a ton of home butter.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.440]   Three cups of flour.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.000]   Three quarters of a cup of sugar.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:34.840]   And one and 1/2--
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.080]   You have two vedent leo.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.040]   So you can't sous vide shortbread.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.440]   What are you nuts?
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.520]   You know he's going to--
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.440]   You have two shortbread sous vide shortbread.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.320]   It bakes in seconds.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.760]   Just brown it.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.480]   Isn't that cool?
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.200]   So apparently, Ted Lasso's shortbread recipe
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.600]   really is a shortbread recipe from the New York Times.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.000]   That's an awesome way to get people engaged
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.040]   is to--
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:58.880]   --just to know--
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.400]   They knew people would do that.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.960]   It's like when NASA put up the design on the parachute.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.440]   And the parachute.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.400]   Wasn't that awesome?
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.520]   Everybody, they decipher that within hours.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.320]   It was amazing.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.080]   All right, one more break.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.040]   And then folks, gentlemen and women--
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.040]   well, there's no women here.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.040]   But if there were, we would be preparing our picks of the week.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.520]   Coming up next, our show today brought to you quite literally
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.440]   by CashFly.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.440]   CashFly's been our CDN content delivery network
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.080]   for more than a decade.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.520]   Actually, it was Matt Levine at the founder CashFly.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.040]   Call me early on in the Twitter network.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.560]   It said, dude, you got to stop using BitTorrent
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.280]   to deliver your podcasts.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.240]   Come on, CashFly.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.640]   And it's been a great relationship ever since.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.600]   We know CashFly works.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.720]   With all those points of presence all over the world,
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.640]   you know that your customers, your listeners,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.680]   are getting their podcasts or apps or downloads
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.360]   from a server close to them, which means it's a lot faster.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:03.960]   So fast that they can now offer ultra low latency streaming.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.960]   Now, we're not talking web RTC, the solution that's
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.400]   led us down in the past.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.800]   Stream delays with CashFly are less than one second.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.840]   And there are more perks.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:15.800]   You can play it anywhere.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.440]   They have an HTML5 player.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.040]   You can use it.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:18.800]   Offer is easy.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.520]   Support anywhere with an SDK available for even better mobile
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.600]   support.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.800]   That means your player will run everywhere-- websites,
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.720]   applications, mobile devices, any platform.
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.040]   They've got you covered.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.960]   And of course, as I mentioned, CashFly is a global CD
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.080]   and 50 points of presence--
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.160]   more than 50 points of presence--
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.320]   distributed all over the world.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.400]   So your streams will come quickly to your viewers,
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.000]   no matter where they live, no matter what continent they're on.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.200]   It scales beautifully, too.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:53.200]   You can deliver video to more than 1 million users concurrently.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.400]   You can ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.800]   And that means any kind of stream-- RTMP, RTMPS, SRT,
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.960]   whatever-- and automatically converted with live failover
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.600]   that transmucks it into ultra low latency SLDP or HLS streams.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.400]   They can do it all at once.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.920]   They've really put some effort and time into this.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.280]   And it's a very powerful solution.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.800]   Plus, it's custom built for your unique needs
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.160]   on top of their CashFly's reliable, robust global network.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.600]   With ingest and delivery anywhere you need it.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.800]   And the best support-- nice people.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.320]   They're 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.440]   And I think it's every day of the year that
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.880]   would be 365 days a year.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.680]   24, 7, 365 priority support.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.200]   They're always there when you need them.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.800]   CashFly's infrastructure can support more than a million
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.680]   concurrent streams today.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.400]   And CashFly's the world's most reliable CDN
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:57.920]   with a 100% SLA up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.360]   They're also helping the world with the goal of serving 300,000
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.600]   warm meals to folks in need with World Central Kitchen.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.280]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.200]   They pioneered the first any cash CDN infrastructure
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.680]   in 2002 in their Best Hub technology.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   Automatically finds the fastest route
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.640]   to and from customer origin across their global network
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.160]   of pops for maximum performance and reliability.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.040]   All I need to say is we use them and love them.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.680]   Find out what CashFly could do for you.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.240]   Bring your bill, your current CDN bill,
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.440]   and your usage trends to twit.cashfly.com.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.120]   See if you're overpaying as much as 20%.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.720]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.480]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.560]   You're the streaming winner.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.760]   Winner, winner.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.240]   CashFly.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.240]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:52.440]   So my pick-- now, while I get frustrated with what Epic does
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.760]   in the business sense of things, one of the coolest pieces
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.680]   of software I've seen in I don't know when
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.560]   is the new meta-human, which you can download for free from--
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.280]   this is from Unreal.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.720]   You can create new characters that are fully rigged, fully
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.880]   textured out of here for Unreal.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.680]   It's free.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.240]   And the details are incredible.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.120]   In addition to that, it is just plain fun.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.400]   If you look at this here, let me--
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.800]   These, the quality of this is really good.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.000]   These look very human.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.400]   No uncanny valley.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.960]   Well, there's a look there.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.640]   If you look at this--
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.760]   so here is some people that I can blend towards.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.480]   So if I grab onto his nose, you can see how I can kind of--
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.080]   Look at that.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.000]   Did this start with a real person,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.600]   or is this completely synthetic?
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.680]   I think it was-- I don't know the whole story,
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.040]   but it was basically what's been done in the past
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.720]   with these kinds of things have been a composite of lots
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.800]   and lots and thousands of scans.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   But you can also get into things where I just
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.560]   want to move some stuff around.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.240]   Rather than blending it between people,
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:05.560]   I can kind of play with the way these things look.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:05.920]   Oh, man.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.680]   Police departments could use this to create--
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:09.840]   Yeah, did it look like this?
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.040]   Did it look like this?
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.480]   Well, yeah, you could probably--
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.540]   And you can pull the ears back a little bit.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.140]   Yeah, I mean, definitely for police sketches.
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.220]   I didn't even thought about that.
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:20.660]   He's kind of like a individual.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:21.140]   He's a sinner.
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.420]   I think you could push on.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.820]   Well, and then with all of this, you have--
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:32.660]   oh, the skin, we can play with color.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.700]   And a lot of it is, again, within the range
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.140]   that makes sense for this.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.820]   Eyes, teeth--
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.380]   I give him a little--
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.740]   maybe he needs a little makeup there.
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.260]   Oh, look at that.
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:52.100]   But all of this stuff is stuff that can be--
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:53.180]   and then give him a beard.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:53.700]   There we go.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:57.380]   And see what he would look like as Ziggy Stardust.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:03.100]   And then, of course, you can go to what is his body type.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.740]   So if we feel like he should be a little heavier,
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:07.740]   that's all there.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:09.780]   And what's really powerful about that,
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.380]   in addition to the fact that it's--
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:17.540]   you know, he'll give him a little bit of a sw--
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.100]   so anyway--
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.140]   That's exactly the man who stole my purse, Officer.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.500]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:26.660]   So the big thing is, is that once you get this built out,
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:29.660]   you can export it out to-- you can save it to your account
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.740]   and then open it up in Unreal.
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:35.060]   And so all of the--
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.100]   So it could be animated.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:37.860]   It's not just a 3D model, it's good.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:38.300]   Exactly.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.860]   In real time, in Unreal.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:43.980]   And the hardest part is doing all of the blending,
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.220]   all the blend shapes that are required to make this all work
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.700]   are all built for you, instead of you having to build them
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:49.820]   out, right.
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:54.060]   And so it is-- now, in addition to it, even if you never use Unreal,
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.860]   it's just a lot of fun, especially in conference calls
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.740]   that you're not talking in.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:43:59.700]   You're mostly just listening.
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.180]   Sit there.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:02.420]   Just like this is the new Alex has been doing for the last two
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:02.900]   hours.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:03.900]   OK.
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:04.460]   OK.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:10.420]   Next level of doodling is just playing with Metahuman.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:12.340]   It's really, really--
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.380]   what software is this?
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:14.500]   Is it its own stand-alone?
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.580]   It's in the cloud.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:16.620]   Oh, it's in the cloud.
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:17.100]   Wow.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:19.220]   So when you open it, I think it takes about a minute
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:19.700]   to turn up.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.980]   And usually when I see a minute to turn something on it,
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:24.940]   it usually means that it's spinning up an instance in AWS.
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:27.380]   So my guess is that's how it works.
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.500]   It does limit you to an hour session at a time.
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.300]   So I think that what it's doing is it's opening up
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.460]   an AWS instance and then streaming back what you're looking at.
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:37.780]   That's my guess because the amount of data that it's dealing
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.300]   with would crush a lot of computers.
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.860]   And it doesn't seem like any computer I jump on.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.100]   It works on all of them.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.460]   So I don't think you're doing your computer
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.180]   doing the rendering.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.900]   I think you're just getting video.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:50.940]   And it is so much fun and it's so incredible.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:53.060]   Now, one thing they don't have that the most common thing
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:55.620]   that people ask is, could I take photos of somebody
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.700]   and match this person, match the character,
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:58.500]   and the answer is no.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.260]   And I don't think it's a technical limitation.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:02.460]   I think they've decided.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.540]   They don't want to get into the fake world.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:08.980]   There are adversarial networks that people have set up
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.540]   that can do at least in research papers
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.020]   when presented that do exactly that same thing.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:18.180]   It takes the output of a solution like this
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:20.820]   and has it run against a facial recognition app
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.380]   and tries to eventually can iterate,
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:26.980]   don't come back to me until you've got at least a 98% facial
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:27.500]   match.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.860]   And at that point, it's good enough that--
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:30.860]   Well, great.
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:33.620]   So now instead of having a head-on look at this person,
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.100]   now I can actually rotate it and see
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:36.460]   what it looked like from other angles.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:42.940]   And just the idea of even if we're not talking about criminals,
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:45.340]   criminal and police behavior, we're talking about,
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:47.980]   there is somebody who has--
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:52.020]   you have only one really good picture of your uncle
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.980]   water skiing and jumping the shark.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.460]   But unfortunately, there's this big splash over his face.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:57.980]   So you can basically--
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:58.980]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.620]   You can even see there's iPhone apps
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:05.020]   that will just take your old photos or even any old photo
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.500]   and make it move around.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500]   But this is what this is great for is generating--
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.860]   now what I'm going to probably use it for the most
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.140]   is building--
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:14.860]   if you're building a demo for somebody
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.540]   and you want to say this is what it would look like if people
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:17.940]   were sitting around or people were doing it.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.780]   Now you can just throw them all together really fast.
[01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:22.460]   And Adobe has another one called Maximo, which is similar.
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:25.500]   But this one, because it drives straight into Unreal,
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.740]   and literally you can-- in Unreal Engine,
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.340]   you can take your iPhone with the front facing ID, the face ID.
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:36.820]   And you can drive the face on one of these CG characters
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:37.540]   like that.
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:40.020]   Like it takes a couple minutes to connect those things.
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:41.900]   And now you're just sitting and talking to your phone
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.780]   and able to animate the face on the character.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.460]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.980]   You said Tom Cruise, let me show you.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.620]   This is a guy named Miles Fisher.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.940]   He's a Tom Cruise, a person here.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.500]   It doesn't look that much like Tom Cruise.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:04.260]   But they use this essentially the same idea to--
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:07.060]   there's Tom Cruise's face on the left to map his face
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:09.740]   onto the impersonator's face.
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.620]   And then it really does look like--
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:14.500]   because he does all the Tom Cruise mannerisms down
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.740]   and now with the actual face it's indistinguishable
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:17.740]   from a real Tom Cruise.
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:18.900]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:25.020]   That was not that genealogy website that
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:27.220]   had that take your ancestors' face.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:28.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.220]   You've made a sense history that Tom
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.220]   or whatever.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:33.180]   They were actually licensing technology from a company
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.340]   that specializes in exactly that sort of thing.
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.820]   So what--
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.220]   I just meant to--
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.380]   many human doesn't do that.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.540]   I know that we'll end up with this.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.220]   There'll be a whole bunch of tweets out that there.
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:44.220]   No, no.
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.580]   We're saying this is exactly what many human doesn't do.
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:49.780]   And people have asked it and they say, no, it doesn't
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.500]   because they don't want to get in this.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.340]   They don't want to get in this.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.100]   They could do it.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.100]   Of course they could do it.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:55.740]   I'm sure it's available.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:57.940]   If this guy from Belgium could do it,
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:00.980]   I'm sure Unreal Engine could do it.
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:02.220]   Anyway, it's so much fun.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:02.420]   Very cool.
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.620]   It is so much fun to build out characters.
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.660]   I would highly recommend.
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.460]   You have to wait a couple days after you go up
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.660]   and request access and then it'll give it to you, I think.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.300]   I mean, I don't know anybody that hasn't gotten it
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:16.260]   in a couple days, but once you're in, so much fun.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.580]   Just so much fun to play with it.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.700]   Request access at unrealengine.com.
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:22.060]   Met a human creator.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:23.580]   Andy and I go your pick of the week.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.980]   Well, I'm going to be up--
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.100]   I don't want to pretend I'm going to be up late
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.860]   on Thursday night to buy pre-order.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.500]   What time can we pre-order?
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.340]   What time can we pre-order midnight?
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.220]   What is it?
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:38.020]   I think it's 5 AM.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:38.780]   Are they doing that again?
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.020]   That's what it was for air techs.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.060]   I had to get up at 5 AM.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:43.180]   Of course they didn't even imagine I are.
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:44.660]   Yeah, so 5 AM my time.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:45.580]   All right, great.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.180]   Yep.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:50.940]   OK, so actually, I will have to stay up like three hours late
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:55.260]   because I can't get up early to make sure.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.340]   So yeah, I'm--
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.260]   Well, you're saying you go to bed at 3 AM?
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.460]   If I've got my work done on time, yes.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.820]   OK, god.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:08.740]   All I'm saying is that if there are something absolutely
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.300]   it's going to be my butt.
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:13.860]   If I don't make this thing, if I get eight, it's like,
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:14.540]   you know what?
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.900]   If I have nothing to do in the afternoon after that,
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:20.540]   I think I'd much rather just stay up like 23, 24 hours.
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:21.540]   Sure.
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:23.620]   That's the only way I can guarantee myself,
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:25.820]   I will be awake and alert and processing.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.900]   And I woke up anyway about 4.30,
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.300]   and I just waited a half an hour and ordered the air techs
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:31.060]   and went back to bed.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.260]   And I guess that's what I am.
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:34.140]   This Friday, right?
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.260]   For everything, right?
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.260]   Friday.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:40.300]   40% of my brain is dedicated to defeating any attempt
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:43.940]   to have a mechanical or electronic device wake me up.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.220]   I actually built an app.
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:47.700]   Wow.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:50.500]   The only thing that actually worked was I built an app
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:57.380]   that would generate a random number between one and like 256.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   Square that number and then display that square
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:02.500]   and it wouldn't turn off until I typed in
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.300]   like the square root of that number from memory.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.700]   And that worked for a while until my brain just figured out
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.620]   that I can probably just like keep pushing at this device.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.460]   I probably just need to feed the speaker.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.300]   It's three.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:15.500]   No, it's four.
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:16.940]   It's five.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:17.740]   Go to bed.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:18.340]   Go to sleep.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.340]   Go away.
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:21.340]   But that's not my pick of the week.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.340]   So because I'm thinking about--
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:24.100]   Oh, that would be good.
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.700]   That would be good, mate.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.300]   That would help to start to amortize the expense of the $13
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:32.420]   to $100 to $15 I'm spending on it.
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:34.460]   So getting back to--
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.860]   like we talked about with Renee earlier,
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.860]   I don't really like the folio cases so much
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:41.900]   as I like having a really nice external portable keyboard.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:46.100]   And part of that is having some sort of like a really nice case
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.740]   of your keyboard that can turn into--
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:53.580]   oops, that can turn into an easel.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.100]   This is what I used to use from my original iPad all the way up
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:01.100]   to just before the iPad Pro that I have.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.140]   This is the in cases origami.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.020]   And it folds into this nice little integrated stamp.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.260]   See, that's a better way to do it and a lot cheaper.
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.860]   Well, that's why because that way--
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.220]   and this is not the magic keyboard.
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.740]   This is like the older version that had like the old keys.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.740]   I might have those two of those lying around.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:18.220]   It's possible that I didn't take the batteries out when
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.740]   I put it this in the stores three or four years ago.
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.460]   But I'm actually looking at something brand new.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.500]   This is something similar to that by Studio Neat called
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.900]   the Canopy cost just $40.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.100]   And it's a similar sort of idea.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.620]   It works with the new magic keyboard,
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.500]   like the latest version of it, where
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.740]   it is a very nice slim keyboard case that
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.180]   will keep that external keyboard protected inside your bag.
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:44.860]   But it unfolds into an easel stand for a phone or a tablet.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:46.220]   Oh, nice.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.260]   It looks like it's pretty much what I want.
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:49.620]   The only thing I don't like about it
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:55.220]   is that with this old version from this other company,
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:58.100]   the keyboard just is held in just by a couple of clips.
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.340]   You can easily remove it.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.980]   So that if I want to just, again, it has this as a separate
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.580]   keyboard, again, that sort of desktop sort of experience,
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.340]   I can do that.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.660]   With the Canopy, I understand that it has self adhesive
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:11.220]   strips that keeps the magic keyboard stuck to it.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.460]   I'm betting that you can just not take the--
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:16.980]   you can not pull the pin on those strips
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:20.140]   and just use it to kind of lose popping in there.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.940]   But either way, it's well worth looking at if you're like me,
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.660]   someone who doesn't really want--
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.140]   if I'm going to go for the bulk of having some sort of a keyboard,
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:30.220]   I want a good keyboard, not a bad keyboard.
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:34.180]   And for $40, it's definitely within the ballpark of, hey,
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:37.180]   I'll take a floater on it and see how it works.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:39.500]   It does mean that I realize that I have not tried out
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.100]   the newest magic keyboard for long-term testing.
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.420]   So that's another thing I'm buying at the Apple Store
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:47.220]   on Thursday or something.
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.700]   Yeah, because it's really--
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:52.260]   don't ask the question, which iPad does it go to?
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:53.780]   It works with anything.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:55.780]   It needs to fit the keyboard.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:57.500]   That's what the cases work.
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:01.700]   But the nice thing is that $40 is a lot better cost to eat
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:06.660]   than $350 because your magic keyboard diesel stand
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:07.460]   doesn't work anymore.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:10.220]   I can afford $40 every three years.
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.580]   Yeah, I don't think I want to--
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.300]   how much is Apple's magic keyboards?
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.060]   Can't be that much.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.580]   $350 for the 12 point--
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:16.980]   No, not the case.
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:17.980]   The magic--
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:19.260]   100 bucks.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.540]   See, that's now for $140.
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.140]   I have a very good keyboard.
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:27.100]   It's not tuned for the iPad, but that
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.740]   might be the right way to go.
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.180]   No track-- also no trackpad.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.420]   Oh, no trackpad.
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:34.140]   Again, I kind of rather have it off the keyboard.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.140]   Right.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:36.940]   Good pick.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.060]   Canopy.
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.900]   Studio Neat, studioneat.com $40.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:44.580]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:48.340]   So because iOS 14.5 just went live
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.420]   and some of the stuff is complicated,
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:53.100]   I found this video by Jacqueline Dallas, who's just
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.460]   this incredibly talented YouTuber.
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.300]   She does a nothing but tech channel.
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:54:00.500]   And she made a video explaining how
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:04.180]   the anti-tracking and Facebook first party, third party.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.660]   She made an incredibly well done, first person
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.460]   narrated, animated, just gorgeous video
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:12.220]   that I think anybody--
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:14.860]   anybody you could give it to anyone in your family,
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:17.260]   no matter how tech savvy or unsavvy they are,
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:20.460]   and they will immediately get not only how the function works,
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:22.100]   but why it's important.
[01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.460]   And I think it's really critical to communicate
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.060]   these sorts of things, especially when
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.900]   you and maybe scary technology and Facebook
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.220]   FUD is floating off in the distance.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:36.220]   It's the nothing but tech channel on YouTube.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.500]   I've never seen the universe stop.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.340]   I'm going to have to check it out.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.420]   It looks really well produced.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:42.820]   There's a lot of Android reviews, too,
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:44.420]   so she's an opportunity to talk to you.
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:44.900]   Nice.
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.460]   Nothing but tech.
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:47.980]   I love it.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:48.940]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.140]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:52.380]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:53.660]   That's it for Macbreak Weekly.
[01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:57.540]   This week you'll find Renee Ritchie at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.380]   Spread the love.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:00.220]   Go over there.
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:01.860]   If you visit that, then the Apple talks.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.260]   He does it at Georgia Dow.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.660]   He's actually what you're really doing well.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.900]   And I know you like this nothing but tech,
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.900]   but I have to say you explain this stuff better than anybody.
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:16.500]   And it's a really great channel.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.540]   Renee's doing new videos.
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:23.260]   It feels like every day, practically.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.180]   There's one now on the purple iPhone, the air tag
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.740]   questions with actually with an Apple executive.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.580]   You did an interview.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:32.780]   That's pretty cool.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.140]   The purple iPhone video, after I got my shot,
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.260]   I slept for 22 hours.
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.620]   I was so tired.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:41.060]   This is the-- if you ever want to see what actual Renee is like,
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:43.300]   and Leo can attest to this because we've had lunch,
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:46.820]   it's-- I talk about Canadian coins, Star Wars.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:48.660]   It's the closest you'll ever get to having
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.500]   an actual conversation with me because I was so based.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.420]   I couldn't do anything but just talk to the camera.
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:56.780]   Just for you, I will create a Canadian coins group
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.540]   in our Discord channel for the club and the coins.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.100]   And you can come in and talk loonies all you want.
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:02.580]   There are--
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:03.460]   Looney, Toonie, or Moosey.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.580]   Which one of those is all--
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:07.260]   There's already a comics channel, so I don't have to create that.
[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.660]   But I will create the Looney channel.
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:09.940]   I'm not going to go find Andy in there.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:12.460]   The Looney channel for you.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.340]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.260]   Andy and Ico.
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:17.300]   When are you going to be on Jeebee-H?
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:18.540]   W-G-B-G.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.780]   Jee-H!
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:23.420]   I'm on early this week because I'm getting my second COVID
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.740]   shot on Friday.
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.060]   And just in case I'm feeling like the first pancake
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:33.300]   out of the pan, I'm going on Wednesday at 1 PM.
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:37.300]   Go to W-G-P-H-News.org, either live or later to listen.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:38.580]   You're smart.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.460]   Lisa got her second Pfizer yesterday.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:44.700]   And she's a little struggling today.
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.020]   She's actually working.
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:50.700]   But she's working on that 18, et cetera.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.740]   So it's funny.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.300]   Did you do Moderna or Pfizer?
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:55.300]   Did you say?
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:56.660]   Pfizer, Pfizer.
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:57.380]   I don't know.
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:56:58.220]   I mean, I'm a Durna.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.300]   I don't have any effect because I'm an--
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.020]   I'm an AstraZeneca kid.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.300]   AstraZeneca.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.780]   All the ways.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:06.140]   You've had your first though, not your second.
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:08.260]   But after we till August for my second--
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.940]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:11.260]   Canada, we don't make our own vaccine.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.580]   Leo, we're at the mercy of the transmission.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.140]   I know.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:13.420]   We'll see--
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:15.300]   Whatever we'll throw over the border at you.
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:17.420]   It's because the earlier harvest, I think.
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.860]   Same reason for the things.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.860]   Everything's earlier in Canada.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.780]   I am actually-- it'll be two weeks of tomorrow.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.180]   So I'm going to go out and cough on people.
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:30.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.700]   No, I promise.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:32.180]   Leo?
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:33.220]   I'm still wearing a mask.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:35.100]   I promise everywhere I go.
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.660]   Alex Lindsey-- oh, man.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.580]   This man works hard.
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:40.700]   Office hours every day of the week.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:48.100]   You can find out more at youtube.com/AlexLindsayly.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.300]   There's even a link if you want to join the Zoom there.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:51.300]   Yes, yes.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:55.140]   We had a great session on Saturday with David Mallon from--
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:58.620]   Mallon, I'm sorry-- from Harvard talking about CS50
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.860]   and a lot of the second hours.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:02.260]   I love him.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:05.580]   I've assigned CS50 to a number of mentees,
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:07.140]   but I also have taken it.
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:09.380]   He is inspiring.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.340]   He is.
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.140]   You can't speed him up.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:14.460]   He's talking about a science--
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:14.980]   Is he the same way?
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:19.300]   Yeah, because college-level computer science
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.380]   lectures for Harvard, freshman, and MIT,
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:26.620]   and he does those two hours talks without taking a breath.
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:27.420]   It's amazing.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:29.460]   And it's like, I don't know how he does it.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.060]   He's really good.
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.740]   And he talked about how--
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:36.060]   he started doing this with videotapes in the late '90s.
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:37.140]   And so it's been--
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:38.780]   They've been up 20 years of development.
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.620]   He's really been able to play with that.
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:43.820]   And our cooking thing is starting to get to be kind of fun.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:46.860]   We're cooking on Saturdays.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:48.660]   It's really an experiment in production.
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.900]   So what happens is we actually have three shows.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.260]   One show is you're watching the YouTube.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:54.420]   The second one is you can actually
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:56.300]   watch Cook's Cooking along with the show.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:57.140]   That's so funny.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:59.060]   And ask questions and everything else.
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.660]   And then the third one is you can listen to our comms
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.300]   and listen to the show get done.
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:08.500]   Because we've got all these pretty complicated comm system,
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.140]   which we went over today in our second hours.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:12.340]   So it's a great learning if you want
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.940]   to see how a lot of this stuff gets done.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.500]   It's a pretty slick thing.
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:17.700]   It's 150 people watching the behind the scenes
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:19.060]   of how it all comes together.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.540]   And then we discuss it for an hour and a half
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:22.420]   after the event, like what worked and what didn't work
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:23.620]   and that type of thing.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.300]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:26.020]   I'm so impressed with the way you're doing it.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.820]   And of course, you sound cute for sending me
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:32.620]   an invite over to your Discord so I could see it in person
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.020]   what's going on in here.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:37.620]   And you really gave me a lot of great ideas for how I might
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.980]   want to run our club to a Discord.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:40.540]   So thank you.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:41.140]   I appreciate it.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.740]   It's a pretty cool community.
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:47.260]   And you got a lot of categories.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.140]   Well, it started with just a few.
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:50.740]   And then we just kept on going, OK, here's
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:52.260]   a category of a bunch of channels.
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:55.700]   And it was one of those things that built up over the first month
[01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.660]   or two.
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:58.820]   Yeah, that's kind of the way I wanted to do it.
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.900]   And basically, after a couple of days of overwhelm,
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.580]   I said, well, we better make some channels.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:06.220]   So we have in our club to a Discord,
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.500]   we have one for each show.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.500]   In fact, we're on right now in the Mac Break Weekly channel.
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:12.740]   And then we also have some categories.
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:14.940]   And like I said, Looney's coming soon.
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:16.140]   We already have comics.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:18.140]   So we're almost there.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:20.900]   If you want to join Club Twit, the primary benefit
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:25.500]   is an ad-free version of all of our shows, both audio and video.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.700]   That's really what you're getting for $7 a month.
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:30.380]   But there's a little extra added benefit with the Discord.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:31.780]   And it's really been a lot of fun.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.900]   It's a chat system that does audio and video.
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.580]   I've been taking questions from the audience
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:38.740]   during some of our shows.
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:39.900]   I don't think I'll have time today
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.380]   because I want to get over to security now.
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:44.060]   But we have a stage up.
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:47.580]   And people can join us in the stage and ask questions.
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:48.580]   And so forth.
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.580]   It's kind of like Club House during our podcast.
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:51.580]   I think we're going to do some shows.
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:54.380]   We did a Linux show on Saturday that got a great response.
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:56.140]   I think we'll probably do that again next Saturday
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:59.100]   with Jonathan Bennett from Floss Weekly.
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:00.700]   At least I did an inside twit.
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:03.540]   So we didn't think of this as really
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.740]   why people would join the club.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:06.340]   We thought it would be through the ad-free versions.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:09.540]   But I have to say Club Twit is a lot of fun in our Discord.
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:13.260]   And then there is a special Twit+ feed with fun stuff.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:17.300]   In fact, Alex, we made a Club Twit+ feed
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:19.500]   of your popcorn discussion.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.500]   (laughing)
[02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:21.820]   And I wanted to thank you
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:24.820]   because you recommended the Amish Country Mushroom.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.020]   - It's pretty good, isn't it?
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:27.620]   - Okay, I bought a six pound bag.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.020]   We're halfway through it already.
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.860]   And I got a Worley pop.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:33.580]   But I got the, you know, I couldn't find the Lindy pop
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:34.420]   that you recommended.
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.260]   I think they stopped me.
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:36.100]   - I don't think they make it anymore.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:38.500]   - Yeah, but Worley pop responded
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:40.860]   by making a copper bottom thick aluminum.
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:41.700]   - Oh good.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.540]   - Worley pop.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.500]   It's fantastic.
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:44.780]   And I do your recipe.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.660]   In fact, I liked it so much.
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:48.500]   I sent one to my mom.
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.260]   And I got her to got one from my nephew.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.180]   So the whole family now is making mushroom popcorn.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:55.100]   It's the best popcorn I've ever had.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.380]   Does not taste like mushrooms.
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:58.380]   It's just mushroom-sized kernels.
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.460]   They're incredible.
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:00.820]   - And the texture is just perfect.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:01.660]   - It's perfect.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:02.500]   - And it just, yeah.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:03.340]   - It's perfect.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:05.380]   - We went through a lot of popcorn to find that one.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:07.380]   - Well, if you're in the club,
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:09.060]   go to the Twit+ feed.
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.980]   There's a whole sound.
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:11.820]   - I'll go in.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:13.580]   - I don't define it yet.
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:16.220]   - Well, we just basically, we've taken whatever,
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:17.580]   you know, the stuff that wouldn't,
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:19.140]   it's from the cutting room floor, basically.
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:20.300]   They wouldn't have made it in the podcast,
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:23.300]   but it's been a lot of fun
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.620]   plus those additional shows we do and things like that.
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:30.860]   If you want to find out more twit.tv/club twit,
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:32.620]   thank you to everybody who's joined.
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:34.260]   We have over 2,000 members now.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.620]   It's been really a lot of fun in there.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:36.900]   Thank you everybody.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:40.260]   And that's about it for Mac Break Weekly for this week.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.180]   Thanks Renee, Andy, Alex.
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:44.020]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.420]   We do Mac Break Weekly of a Tuesday morning
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.300]   around 11 a.m. Pacific for me, 2 p.m. in the afternoon
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.860]   for the East Coasters.
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.860]   And if you're somewhere else in the world,
[02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:57.220]   just do the calculation, it's 1100,
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.780]   no, I'm sorry, 1800 UTC.
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.300]   So you can figure out what time it is.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.540]   If you want to watch us do it live,
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.260]   the easiest thing to do is just go to twit.tv/live.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.060]   There's live audio and video there.
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:10.580]   If you're already in our club twit, of course,
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:12.100]   the stage is up and you can listen there.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:14.820]   We don't have video in a club twit yet.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:18.060]   You can also download shows on demand from our website,
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:21.620]   twit.tv/mbw.
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:23.460]   And when you get there, you'll also see a link
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.260]   to our YouTube channels.
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:26.980]   We have a very active YouTube channel.
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:28.660]   All the shows are there.
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:32.700]   You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast player,

[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:47.700]   Leave us a review as well.
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:49.660]   Five-star review would not hurt.
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.740]   I'm just saying.
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.740]   Thanks everybody for being here.

[02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.260]   Bye-bye.
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:01.100]   Hey, what's going on everybody?
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.380]   I am Ant Perot and I wanna tell you about my show,
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:07.620]   Hands on Photography here on Twit.TV.

[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:16.140]   and tricks that are gonna help make you a better photographer.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.140]   And it's not always about Photoshop.
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.980]   It's not always about just having the biggest
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.060]   and baddest and bestest camera.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.500]   It can be the simplest of things like,
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:29.260]   "Leave your eye open when you're looking through the viewfinder."
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:31.260]   All of these simple tips can really help
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.660]   step your photography game up.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:34.300]   So subscribe to the show today,
